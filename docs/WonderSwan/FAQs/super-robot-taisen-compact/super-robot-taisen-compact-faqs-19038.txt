Super Robot Taisen Compact Walkthrough
Version 1.0 - 08/29/2002
by Carlos Satoshi Mori (csmori@hotmail.com)



   This is my walkthrough for Super Robot Taisen Compact, the first install-
ment of the Super Robot Taisen (Super Robot Wars) series on the Wonderswan. I
hope this guide can be of help for all those who wish to play this game, even
if they don't know japanese.

   The Super Robot Taisen (SRW) series is quite well-known among mecha anime
fans, having games released for almost all major game consoles released since
the 90's. It is basically a large mecha cross-over, featuring several robots
from various "giant-robot" animes, as well as their pilots and enemies.

   Super Robot Taisen Compact has the same basic structure all other games in
the series have, and getting used to it should not be difficult for those who
already played any of its other games; its story, however, isn't connected to
any game for the other consoles - SRW Compact and SRW Compact 2 make an "uni-
verse" of their own.

   Before going any further, please be aware that this document aims to des-
cribe all events, and all possibilities there are for players; as such, it is
very revealing, and can spoil your fun. I did this because most of this FAQ's
intended readers can't read or understand japanese, and would not be able to
understand the events in this game by other means.

   In addition, notice this FAQ applies to the Wonderswan version of the game
- the Wonderswan Color version is pretty much the same storywise, but several
events and gameplay elements were modified. Therefore, if you are playing the
color version, do NOT trust everything you read here.

PROLOGUE---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Universal Century 00XX.

   Oldtypes and Newtypes, Earthnoids and Spacenoids... To put an end to these
antagonisms, a genial scientist worked to develop ways to promote a new human
evolution.

   This scientist's name was Souzou Haran.

   To allow people to survive in any environment, he struggled day and night
to create cyborgs - "Meganoids" - able to break free from Earth and gravity's
shackles to live in space, and from there begin to move further and deeper in
space.

   However, his hopes were crushed when Meganoid Prototype Units 1 ("Zauser")
and 2 ("Korosu") ran insane during an experiment and destroyed the laboratory
at Mars they were at.

   Having lost her master Souzou, Meganoid Korosu, obeying an imperfect, left
behind program, put a "Human Meganoidization Plan" in motion and declared war
against the humans of Earth.

   To make things worse, an invasion from the Muge Empire overlapped this...
With battles against the Meganoids on Earth, and against the Muge Empire on
space, the world was engulfed on a war never seen before.

   By the end of the war, Japan took pride of the work of two great research
establishments in the battle against the Meganoids... The Super Robots of the
Saotome Institute and Photon Power Laboratory were the key to victory.

   At space, the Earth Union Independent Squad "White Base Team" fenced back
the invading enemies, pushing them to the edge - to their main citadel, where
an independent invasion of the Muge Empire space by Dancougar took down their
emperor and brought the conflict to an end.

   But it was not a perfect victory. The Muge were not completely destroyed,
and even though the invaders were reduced to pieces scattered all over space
the destruction of Meganoids Don Zauser and Korosu could not be confirmed -
still, the world was at peace again.


                                  =========


   One year later.

   As Souzou Haran forecasted, because of the antagonisms between Earthnoids
and Spacenoids, an independence war between the independence-declaring colony
nation "Principality of Zeon" and the Earth Union Government (EUGO) finally
outbreaked.

   The White Base Team, who once fought alongside the Spacenoids against the
Muge Empire, was renamed to "Londo Bell" and ordered to defend the Earth, en-
tering a fight that would later be known as the "One Year War".

   In the middle of this fight...

   Having lost their home planet, aliens from Planet Barm plot to make Earth
their new home; the Small Barm group led by Commander Orban stages invasions
from other star systems, immersing the Earth Sphere in an unprecedented level
of chaos...


GAMEPLAY DETAILS-------------------------------------------------------------

   Since this is really not different from any other Super Robot Taisen game,
most of you probably are already familiar with the mechanics of it. So, this
is here pretty much for filler - not very helpful those who have never played
anything like this...


1 - Pilot Status
----------------

   Each pilot has a given set of skills and characteristics, which determines
his/her effectiveness in battle. A pilot's status is unique (no two different
pilots have exactly the same skills), and should be considered when assigning
robots to each pilot.

   When a robot has a co-pilot, pressing the "A" button in the "Pilot Status"
screen lets you switch between the pilot and co-pilot's status screens.


 Kakutou (Fighting)  The pilot skill when using fighting attacks. The higher
                     it is, the more damaging his/her fighting attacks are.

 Shageki (Shooting)  The pilot skill when using shooting attacks. The higher
                     it is, the more damaging his/her shooting attacks are.

 Kaihi   (Evade)     Shows the pilot's dodging skill. Higher values indicate
                     your pilot has better chances to escape enemy attacks.

 Meichuu (Aiming)    The pilot's aiming skill - the higher it is, the easier
                     it is for a pilot to hit an enemy.

 Han'nou (Response)  A measure of the pilot's reflexes. Higher values affect
                     both the pilot's hit and evade rates positively.

 Giryou  (Skill)     The pilot's competency. Higher values make it easier to
                     make critical hits and avoid receiving them.


   Both Aiming and Evade are presented in a "XXX + XX" format. Only the first
number applies to the pilot; the second is the robot's agility, which changes
according to the robot the pilot is boarding.

   Notice that each type of pilot has different average values on each status
category. For instance, Mobile Suit (MS) pilots tend to have higher hit/evade
values than Mazinger pilots - overall, each type of pilot is designed to com-
pensate the advantages and handicaps of their respective robot types.


2 - Unit Status
---------------

   Like pilots, robots and ships have certain skills and characteristics that
differentiate them from each other.


 HP    (Hit Points)  The unit's "life meter". The higher the value, the more
                     damage the unit can suffer before being destroyed.

 EN      (Energy)    The unit's "fuel meter". Shows you the amount of energy
                     the unit has. You spend 1 energy point for every square
                     you move in the sky or in space. Moreover, some attacks
                     spend a certain amount of energy when used. Every turn,
                     each unit recovers 5 energy points.

 Shield              Points if the unit carries a shield or not. "Ari" means
                     it does, "Nashi" means it does not. Only humanoid units
                     carry shields and a pilot must have the "Shield Bougyo"
                     skill to use it.

 Terrain Grades      The unit's efficiency in each terrain (sky, ground, sea
                     and space), rated from "A" to "D", where "A" means this
                     is the terrain where the unit acts to its full potenti-
                     al; a dash means it cannot operate at that terrain.

 Size                The unit's size, from "S" (small) to "LL" (very large).
                     Smaller units have better chances to dodge attacks.

 Shuuri  (Repair)    The money necessary to repair the unit if destroyed. If
                     you destroy an enemy robot, you receive half of its re-
                     pair value as a reward.

 Type                The terrain type the unit was designed for: space, sky,
                     ground, underground, water. Sky means it can fly; space
                     means it cannot act on Earth or indoors; water means it
                     can move on water as well as it does on the ground.

 Idouryoku           The amount of squares this unit can cover in one single
         (Mobility)  move (more details in the "Terrain" section).

 Undousei (Agility)  Added to the pilot aim and evade values, determines the
                     unit's chance to hit enemies and avoid enemy attacks.

 Soukou  (Armor)     The unit's armor strenght. Higher armor means the robot
                     will sustain less damage on every attack suffered.

 Genkai  (Limit)     The unit's maximum sustainable response. If the pilot's
                     hit or evade rates (unit's agility included) are higher
                     than the unit's Limit, the exceeding values are discon-
                     sidered (i.e.: if a unit's limit is 350 and the pilot's
                     hit rate is 400, then in effect the pilot's hit rate is
                     350, because the unit cannot stand more than this).


3 - Weapon Status
-----------------

   Each of the weapons has characteristics of their own as well, which deter-
mine the amount of damage inflicted to their targets, the chance they have to
hit the enemy, et cetera.


 Buki Na             The attack's name; the symbol to the left indicates its
 (Weapon Name)       type: a target-like icon means it is a shooting weapon,
                     while a fist indicates it is a fighting attack.

                     A (P) symbol after the name indicates the attack can be
                     used after the unit has moved around; the (B) indicates
                     it is a beam weapon (and, as such, is affected by anti-
                     beam measures). A (M) symbol means it is a map weapon -
                     an attack that can hit several enemies at once.

 Kougeki (Attack)    The attack's strenght. Obviously, the higher it is, the
                     more damage the weapon can cause.

 Shatei  (Range)     The attack's minimum and maximum ranges, in squares. If
                     its range is 1, the attack is considered "short-range";
                     all other ones are considered "long-range".

 Meichuu (Hit)       A percent bonus to your robot's hit rate. Basically, an
                     attack with +10 Meichuu has 15% more chance to hit than
                     one with a -5 Meichuu value.

 Zandan              The amount of ammo available to this attack. Dashes in-
 (Remaining Shots)   dicate the weapon has no ammo limitations.

 Terrain Grades      The attack's efficiency on each terrain. A dash indica-
                     tes the attack can't hit enemies on that terrain.

 Hitsuyou Kiryoku    A pilot must gather a specific amount of kiryoku to use
 (Required Vitality) certain attacks. Until the pilot has at least this much
                     kiryoku, the attack is not available.

 Hitsuyou EN         Some attacks spend a certain amount of energy each time
 (Required Energy)   they are used. If that's the case, the amount it spends
                     is displayed here.

 Required Skill      Shows the special pilot skill necessary to use this at-
                     tack. Only Newtype or SeiSenshi are required to perform
                     attacks, and very few attacks require them - those that
                     do, however, are very powerful. Notice some attacks may
                     also require a certain level to this skill (i.e.: Hyper
                     Aura Giri requires SeiSenshi Level 3).

 Critical            A bonus to the unit's critical hit rate. Simply put, an
                     attack with +20% has 20% more chance to make a critical
                     hit than an attack with +0% Critical.


   Making good use of your weapons is essential in this game. For example, an
attack with high energy comsumption should be saved for the strongest enemies
- these attacks are often the most powerful and cannot be used constantly.


4 - Upgrading
-------------

   During every intermission, you can upgrade your robots' status and weapons
to improve their performance. Each upgrade costs money, and you are given the
choice of upgrading several different aspects of each robot.

   The more upgrades you do on a unit's given characteristic, the more expen-
sive it becomes. Each category can be upgraded up to ten times. The following
tables show the prices charged for each upgrade, as well as the upgrading va-
lue you get for each category, each time (in parenthesis).


          |                               Costs
          |       1            2            3            4            5
 HP       |  $2000 (200)  $4000 (200)  $6000 (200)  $8000 (200) $10000 (200)
 EN       |  $1000 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)
 Agility  |  $5000 (  5)  $8000 (  5) $10000 (  5) $12000 (  5) $15000 (  5)
 Armor    |  $3000 (100)  $5000 (100)  $8000 (100) $10000 (100) $15000 (100)
 Limit    |  $1000 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)


          |                               Costs
          |       6            7            8            9           10
 HP       | $18000 (200) $20000 (200) $25000 (200) $30000 (200) $35000 (200)
 EN       |  $5000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $15000 ( 20) $20000 ( 20) $30000 ( 20)
 Agility  | $20000 ( 10) $24000 ( 10) $28000 ( 10) $32000 ( 10) $37000 ( 15)
 Armor    | $23000 (150) $27000 (150) $30000 (150) $32000 (150) $33000 (200)
 Limit    |  $5000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20)


   If you upgrade all status categories of one unit to the max, you are awar-
ded an extra prize - you can give your unit one of the following bonuses:


 - Change its terrain grading to "A" in any terrain you choose;
 - Increase its Mobility by 1 point;
 - Increase its Max HP by 2000 points;
 - Increase its Max Energy by 150 points;
 - Increase its Agility by 20 points;
 - Increase its Armor by 500 points.


   Weapons too can be upgraded, but you can only increase their attack power.
There are three different price tables: a cheaper one for weaker attacks, one
table for medium-powered weapons, and another one for stronger moves.


          |                               Costs
          |       1            2            3            4            5
 Weaker   |  $2000 (100)  $4000 (100)  $6000 (150)  $8000 (150) $10000 (150)
 Medium   |  $4000 (100)  $8000 (100) $12000 (150) $16000 (150) $20000 (150)
 Strong   |  $5000 (100) $10000 (100) $15000 (150) $20000 (150) $25000 (200)


          |                               Costs
          |       6            7            8            9           10
 Weaker   | $14000 (150) $26000 (150) $35000 (150) $40000 (200) $45000 (200)
 Medium   | $24000 (150) $38000 (200) $45000 (200) $55000 (200) $65000 (300)
 Strong   | $35000 (200) $50000 (200) $60000 (200) $70000 (300) $80000 (300)


   So, strong weapons are extremely expensive to upgrade, but also yield more
value, especialy in the higher end. Therefore, it is important to choose with
care what weapons and units to upgrade, since it is bound to cost a lot.


5 - Terrain
-----------

   Placing the cursor over an empty square and pressing the "B" button allows
you to see how it affects your aiming ang evade rates. As a general rule, the
more accidented the terrain is the worse your aiming gets, and the better for
your evade rate. So, moving a unit into a mountain allows it to defend itself
better than if it was into an open field, but your unit will also be less da-
maging to any enemy it attacks.

   In addition, the more accidented the terrain is the more it hurts your ro-
bot's mobility. For example, the GP-01Fb's mobility is 8 points. It means the
GP-01Fb can walk, in one turn, up to 8 squares, if on a plain field (a grassy
area without trees or anything); in other words, plain fields require 1 mobi-
lity point per "step". Other terrains, like woods, require 2 points per step,
while more accidented terrains (mountains or forests) take 3 points per step.
So, the GP-01Fb can move up to 4 squares per turn on woods, but only 2 on the
forest.

   The above only applies for ground-bound units; A flying unit does not have
its mobility, aiming or evade rates affected by the terrain they are over. If
a unit is classified as a water type, it can move on water as freely as if it
was on a plain field (that is, 1 mobility point per step).


6 - Items
---------

   Items are external parts or accessories that can be attached to your units
in order to improve their performance, add new functionality or provide HP or
energy refills.

   Items are given as stage clear bonuses, after each stage is completed. The
items you receive are determined by the order you choose to complete the sce-
narios within each scene. So, to collect the best items you should plan ahead
and pick each scenario when it yields the best items.

   At the walkthrough, I will describe, at every scenario, the items you will
receive depending on the order you choose them; as an example, the next table
shows what you get depending on the order you clear the scenarios on Scene 1:


             Scenario      |          2                  3
            ---------------|---------------------------------------
             First         |       $10000           Apogee Motor
             Second        |  Propellant Tank S    Chobham Armor


   If you choose Scenario 2 first, you get $10000 and a Chobham Armor (becau-
se it implies you choose Scenario 3 as second); choosing Scenario 3 first gi-
ves you an Apogee Motor and a Propellant Tank S.

   Some items are given to you regardless of the order you choose - those are
marked on the 'Always' line on each scenario. Because the first and last sce-
narios of each scene are fixed - you cannot choose their order - the items to
receive there are distributed at random: everytime you play the game you gain
a different thing; the items you may get under those circumstances are listed
on the 'Random' row of these scenarios.

   Now, a brief description of all items in the game:

 High Efficiency Radar  Increases all weapon's max range by 1.
                        (except short-range and map weapons)
 Anti-Beam Coating      Equips unit with Beam Coat.
 V-Up Unit              Version up unit. Increases all weapons' attack power


   For V-Up Units the attack power increase the unit gets depends on how many
item slots it has:


                      1 Item Slot : attack power + 100
                      2 Item Slots: attack power + 200
                      3 Item Slots: attack power + 400
                      4 Item Slots: attack power + 800


   Usually, units with four item slots are older, weaker units, which can get
an extra life via V-Up Units. For example: Gundam, L-Gaim, Texas Mack, Getter
Q. As such, these units are good choices even in later levels of the game, as
their V-Upped attack power may actually surpass those of newer units.


7 - Special Pilot Skills
------------------------

   Most pilots have special skills, which are displayed in the "Pilot Status"
screen. You cannot choose when to use these skills: either they are constant-
ly active or the game decides when they are activated.

   In this game there are two kinds of pilot skills: natural and learned. Na-
tural skills are given to each pilot by the game itself, and cannot be obtai-
ned any other way. These are the natural skills available:


 Newtype                Mobile suit pilots only. Some weapons need a newtype
                        pilot to be used; also, newtypes tend to have better
                        stats than non-newtypes.

 Kyouka Ningen          Mobile suit pilots only. An artificial newtype, able
 (Enhanced Human)       to use newtype weapons, they too have superior stats
                        when compared to non-newtypes.

 SeiSenshi              Aura Battler pilots only. Like newtype, some attacks
 (Holy Warrior)         require SeiSenshi pilots (namely Aura Giri and Hyper
                        Aura Giri).

 Shield Bougyo          Allows the pilot to defend attacks with a shield and
 (Shield Defense)       cut the suffered damage by half. The robot must have
                        a shield for this skill to be used, and the level of
                        the skill points the frequency it is activated (fre-
                        quency = level number / 16).

 KiriBarai (Clearing)   Allows the pilot to destroy an incoming solid attack
                        (like missiles or funnels); in addition, it lets the
                        pilot fence off most of the attacks that require the
                        enemy to be close.

                        To be used, the piloted unit must carry a melee wea-
                        pon, and the level of the skill points the frequency
                        it is activated (frequency = level number / 16).

 Sokodikara             When a unit's HP is lower than 1/8 of its total, the
 (Potential)            chance of making a critical hit doubles.


   Learned skills are awarded to you when you clear a scenario in 11 turns or
less. The following table shows what skill you get according to the number of
turns spent:


              Turns                        Skill
           -------------------------------------------------------
            6 or less       ShuuchuuRyoku (Concentration Power)
                7                  SensouShin (War Heart)
                8                   Seishin Points + 10
                9                      Hit Rate + 10
               10                   Critical Rate + 10
               11                 Sokodikara (Potential)


   You can choose the pilot , subpilot, or faerie to assign your new skill to
among those who fought in the scenario you gained the skill at. These are the
available learned skills:


 ShuuchuuRyoku          All of the pilot's seishins have their Seishin Point
 (Concentration Power)  (SP) consumption reduced by 20%.

 SensouShin             Starting kiryoku + 5 (that is, the pilot starts each
 (War Heart)            stage with 105 kiryoku instead of 100).

 Seishin Points + 10    Max SP + 10

 Hit Rate + 10          The pilot's hit rate rises by 10 percent points.

 Critical Rate + 10     His/Her critical rate rises by 10 percent points.

 Sokodikara             When a unit's HP is lower than 1/8 of its total, the
 (Potential)            chance of making a critical hit doubles.


   Notice Sokodikara is available both as a natural and a learned skill. Each
pilot has four slots to allocate skills at, and learned skills cannot replace
natural ones. Since pilots have up to three natural skills, allocating skills
wisely is necessary not to waste them.


8 - Special Robot Skills
------------------------

   Like pilots, some units have built-in capabilities. Unlike pilots, you can
choose when to use them or not, or they are constantly activated. The availa-
ble robot skills are:


 Bunshin (Branching)    If the pilot's kiryoku is 130 or more, the unit gets
                        a 50% chance to escape any enemy attack (if the ene-
                        my has a 30% hit rate, it effectively has only 15%).

 G-Vision               Getter Vision. The Getter 2 version of Bunshin, with
                        exactly the same functioning.

 Mach SP                Mach Special. The Getter Liger equivalent to Bunshin
                        (again, the same functioning as Bunshin).

 Shin Mach SP           Shin Mach Special. Shin Getter 2 version of Bunshin,
                        with yet again the same functioning.

 Henkei (Transform)     Indicates the unit can transform.

 Bunri (Separation)     Indicates the robot can separate into a smaller unit
                        (after separation, it cannot go back to its previous
                        form until intermission).

 Beam Coat              An anti-beam measure. Beam attacks meant to cause up
                        to 1000 HP of damage are completely absorbed by Beam
                        Coating; stronger attacks can pierce the coating, in
                        which case the unit suffers the blow. Present in al-
                        most all Heavy Metal units and in the ZZ Gundam.

 Aura Barrier           An anti-beam measure. Beam attacks meant to cause up
                        to 3000 HP of damage are completely absorbed by Aura
                        Barrier; stronger attacks can pierce the barrier, in
                        which case the unit suffers the blow. Present in all
                        Aura Battler units (including ships).

 I-Field                Yet another anti-beam measure. Beam attacks meant to
                        cause up to 2000 HP of damage are absorbed by the I-
                        Field; stronger attacks can pierce it, in which case
                        the unit suffers the full damage. Present in several
                        units (usually battleships and mobile armors).

 HP Kaifuku             Every turn, the unit has a certain percentage of its
 (HP Healing)           HP recovered. There are two versions of it: Low (ï¿¾Â¬)
                        and High (âÃ¥).


   Anti-beam measures (Beam Coat, Aura Barrier and I-Field) spend 5 EN whene-
ver activated, no matter if they are pierced or not. I am not sure about what
percentage does the HP Kaifuku skills heal, but I imagine it is around 10 and
30% for low and high, respectively. I am also not sure about the damage anti-
beam measures can absorb before breaking.


9 - Seishins
------------

   Seishins are spells pilots can use in order to gain extra temporary skills
or simply help them survive through tough spots. When used, seishins spend SP
(Seishin Points), and the amount of SP consumed varies according to the spell
you are calling for.

   Each pilot has a defined set of six seishins, out of a total of 30. He/she
learns his/her seishins at computer-defined levels, and keeps them forever. A
pilot's SP depends on his/her level (the higher, the more SP) and type (i.e.:
Super Robot pilots tend to have more SP than mobile suit pilots).

   The seishins available in the game can be seen in the "Seishin Lookup" me-
nu, and are presented as follows:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
   |                                                                    |
   |   Jibaku        Konjou        Mikiri      Datsuryoku      Hokyuu   |
   |  Teisatsu       Sogeki       Migawari      Nekketsu         Ai     |

    --------------------------------------------------------------------


   Here are descriptions of what seishin does; the numbers in square brackets
are the amount of SP each of them spends whenever used.

   Usually, pilots of aggressive, attack-oriented units have seishins to rise
their battle effectiveness, while pilots of support units have seishins aimed
at healing allied units or hurting enemy stats.


WALKTHROUGH------------------------------------------------------------------

   Within each Scene of the game, the first and last scenarios are fixed, and
you can choose the order you want to play the scenarios in between. The order
you play the intermediate scenarios defines the items you get after them.


Scene 1: "The Origin of Spirit"
===============================

 First:   Drake Castle                ->  Scenario 1
 Choice:  Sea of Ren                  ->  Scenario 2
 Choice:  Gara Mountain               ->  Scenario 3
 Last:    Drake Castle                ->  Scenario 4


   Bright confers with his pilots about their current battle status; Emma has
no good expectations, as last year's Meganoid Rebellion dealt a nearly fatal
blow on the Earth Union. Amuro disagrees: even if they fall, the Super Robots
are very powerful.

   Bright says the mechs from both the Saotome Institute and Photon Power Lab
are 'frozen' by determination of the Union Parliament. Kou doesn't understand
why give up such strong robots; Amuro explains that according to the Union's
higher officers only military-enrolled machines can be this powerful.

   Units that served with merit in the previous war can't even be dismantled,
because the public opinion would not approve it. So, the managers of the two
laboratories were left with absolutely nothing to do with them. Kou is sorry
no one knows what to do with such powerful machines, which reminds Amuro of a
time when people labeled as newtypes were soft-banned on Earth.

   After a small scene on Space (where two people talk, and one of them seems
ready to start some sort of operation), Bright orders a full unit deployment;
Kou comes out first, and just then Emma detects an UFO approaching. Amuro can
sense who is out there, but can't believe it: Kouji Kabuto, in the Mazinger Z
- used in the last war, and that should have been sent to a museum after the
halt on their usage.

   Kouji explains this did happen, but Mazinger Z had been ready for use all
this time. Also, Sayaka Yumi and Boz came along, although everyone missed the
Aphrodi A and BozBorot at the ground. Amuro says they should know by now that
using these machines is a serious crime, but they are interrupted by a flash
that takes them away...


Scenario 1 (Drake Castle) - "Aura Road"

Events: none


   Shou asks Drake what is the point of dragging the surface inhabitants into
the battle; the answer is he's interested in their overwhelming power. Marvel
warns he doesn't know what he's doing, but Drake won't listen.

   When your team pops up, Kouji and Kou are not anywhere to be found. Bright
wonders if this is Jaburo, but Amuro quickly sees it isn't; however, Char and
his Zaku are there...

   Marvel Frozen introduces herself, and begs for you surface inhabitants not
to cooperate with Drake. Your people are still confused, and ask what is this
place, who are they, who is Drake, and what are those bug-like machines. Shou
says he'll explain later - right now, they have to get out of here.

   Amuro doesn't believe they're lying and there isn't much time to think, so
they decide to trust Shou and fight their way out of there.

   Among the enemies is Bernie, who Chris already knows; have her talk to him
and she'll convince him to fight on your side for this world's sake. You can
have Amuro convince Char too; Amuro says there's no point in fighting now, as
it won't help them return to their world. Surprisingly, Char doesn't seem too
interested in returning with your help - he wants to do it by himself.

   Once you defeat all enemies, Drake, seeing no other way, decides to launch
the Wil Whips, an Aura Battleship several times larger than the Argama. Upon
seeing the Wil Whips is completed, Shou urges everyone to run away and follow
his lead to a safe place. After the intermission, choosing "Sea of Ren" leads
to Scenario 2, while choosing the "Gara Mountain" takes you to 3.


Scenario 2 (Sea of Ren) - "Assault"
-----------------------------------
24x32, Surface
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 9 (Botune, Dunbine, Argama + 6)

Events: none


   Having taken you to the Sea of Ren to hide, Shou learns your two units and
Knee's Botune are the only functional Aura Battlers on Zeranna's army. Before
Shou can introduce you, Burn attacks.

   The enemies are no big deal, except for Char and Burn, as difficult as on
Stage 1. You should be able to breeze through this scenario. Once you destroy
all enemies, go to Scenario 3 if you haven't cleared it yet, otherwise go to
Scenario 4.


Scenario 3 (Gara Mountain) - "Storm Sphere"
-------------------------------------------
32x32, Surface
Goal: Destroy all units
Player Units: 11 (Mazinger Z, BozBorot, Argama + 8)
Initial Enemy Formation: Drumlo Lv08 x05
                         Zaku Kai Lv08 x05

                      Machine Beast Toros D7 Lv08 x02
                      Machine Beast Genova M9 Lv08 x02
Clear Bonus - Always: Booster
              If Stage 2: Apogee Motor
              If Stage 3: Chobham Armor
Events: Turn 3, Player Phase - Mazinger Z, BozBorot appear
                               Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   You reach the Storm Sphere to rescue Queen Sheila; Amuro was imagining it
would be like an asteroid belt, but instead it is just an arid place. Shou is
sure Sheila is being kept there when Drumlos appear among your enemies.

   On Turn 3, Kouji and Boz show up, followed by Machine Beasts. They still
don't understand what happened or where they are, but Shou, upon seeing they
are japanese (Shou is too), asks them to help and he'll explain later. That's
enough for Kouji, who doesn't need an excuse to destroy Machine Beasts.

   After the battle, Shou meets with Sheila and communicates he'll escort her
back to the Na Kingdom. Go to Scenario 2 if you haven't done so yet, or go to
Scenario 4 if you cleared it.

   You return to the Drake Castle in order to rescue Rimru, and to figure out
a way to return to your world. As soon as the Argama appears, Kou shows up as
well - as usual, explanations later.

   Shou can talk to Todd; Shou says there's no way to know what'll happen if
people from the surface keep being summoned here. Todd doesn't care - he only
wishes to defeat Shou, but Shou insists the surface inhabitants shouldn't be
involved in their quarrel.

   Once you defeat all enemies, Rimru appears in a Botune and calls for Knee.
Bright mentions you have just accomplished your original goal, when the same
flash that brought you here engulfs you again - apparently this world rejects
your presence...


Scene 2: "Invasion of the Surface"
==================================

 First:   South America/Jaburo        ->  Scenario 5
 Choice:  Mutron Research Laboratory  ->  Scenario 6
 Choice:  Photon Power Laboratory     ->  Scenario 7
 Choice:  Downtown City               ->  Scenario 8
 Choice:  Saotome Institute           ->  Scenario 9
 Last:    Nishiizu City               ->  Scenario 10


   Another space scene, where the two people now say it already started, and
one authorizes the other to move, apparently in response to someone else's
acts. Back to your team, Shou recognizes that flash as the Aura Road. You are
back to the surface - more specifically to Jaburo. Cham isn't very impressed,
as the surface isn't very different from Bistonwell.

   If Shou talked to Todd during the previous stage, Todd will be there too.
Marvel won't let them fight, as this is not the time for it; Shou proposes
joining their efforts in order to enlarge their own Aura Power, and opening
the Aura Road again with it.

   A transmission comes from Chien Agi, who apparently was trying to get in
touch with you for some time now. She's at the Moon, and just wanted to know
how things are going at Earth; Amuro tells her right now they don't know the
current situation, and Chien tells you Zeon has withdrawn from Earth. Bright
imagines the Union Army has successfully recovered, but that's not the case:
an unknown force appeared at the Earth surface.

   While Kouji imagines it is the work of Dr. Hell, Amuro and Bright notice
things seem quiet, so they have nothing to report. Chien reports outer space
aliens who call themselves Barm declared war against Earth. Bright imagines
it is a second coming of Muge Zorbados (who was fought at the previous war),
but Chien isn't done yet: at the same time, the underground Ghost Empire has
invaded too.

   Kouji finds these people anachronical - still trying to conquer the world
in the Space Colony era, while Kou wonders what powers Kouji's "MS". Amuro
feels it's time to move around, and Bright orders a launch. Todd will fight
with you for now, but warns his final goal still is defeating Shou.

   Chien tells Amuro the development of 'it' is on schedule, and he promises
to return to space soon...

Events: Turn 1, Enemy Phase - Char, Zeon Soldiers leave
        Turn 2, Player Phase - Z Gundam, Re-GZ (BWS), Methuss (MS) appear


   Apparently the Zeons returned to the surface as well - Char seems just as
surprised. Moreover, there are several Machine Beasts and Mechasaurus enemies
in the area.

   Still on Turn 1, Char sees what enemies have appeared on Earth during his
absence; understanding he has no chance against them, he decides to withdraw,
at least until his luck changes. He tells Amuro there's no need to chase him,
since he isn't up to anything right now, but also warns they'll meet again.

   On Turn 2, Camille, Burning and Fa appear; since the Z Gundam was finished
he wanted to see the mysterious army that appeared in Jaburo. Kouji says he's
already having trouble differentiating so many Gundams...

   After the battle, if Amuro talked to Char during Stage 1, look at the unit
status list, and you'll find out you now have Char's Zaku!

Events: Turn 2, Player Phase - Raideen, Blueger appear


   A transmission warns a mysterious underground force appeared at the Mutron
Laboratory. For the first time, you meet with the Ghost Empire. Their leader,
Sharkin, tells you to rejoice, for you will be the trophy that will embelish
the first year of the Demon Era. And, once he crushes you, he'll discover the
Mutron secret.

   Nobody on your side knows what is Mutron. Cham imagines it's like the Aura
Power, while Kouji mentions the japanese research labs must be full of romans
- to come out with names like Photon Power, Getter and Mutron.

   On Turn 2, a voice calls for the brave one and says the age of the demons
has started. It orders the brave one to wake up: Raideen is waiting. Everyone
hears this, but don't know what 'brave one' it refers to. The voice tells the
brave one not to be afraid, for the awakening time arrived and Raideen awaits
there.

   A motorcycle appears, runs off the cliff, then Raideen appears. Its pilot,
Akira, introduces his group as the Coplander Team and asks all soldiers to
lend their power to defeat the demons.

   After the battle, Bright calls the Coplander Team a private army; Jinguuji
says they will enlist at the army if necessary. Akira is more worried at the
fact the age of the demons has arrived as predicted; he tells Raideen was re-
vived with the purpose of fighting the demons, and asks for your cooperation.
Bright hesitates, but Kouji argues that, by accepting Mazinger Z and Dunbine,
the rules have already been broken, and taking one machine more or less won't
change it. Fair enough - Bright accepts Raideen and Blueger in.

   You learn the Machine Beasts are aiming at the Photon Power Lab, in order
to destroy Great Mazinger, currently undergoing adjustments. So, you are the
one to defend the place.

   Baron Ashura is surprised with your arrival: having heard Kouji'd suddenly
disappeared, he didn't expect him to be on the way; Kouji says he just took a
"little sight-seeing trip". Inside the Photon Power Laboratory, Tetsuya only</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
needs Kouji to buy a little more time...

   Kouji can talk to Minerva X, and remind it of its programming as Mazinger
Z's partner robot, which causes it to join you. On Turn 4, Great Mazinger and
Byuunas A appear, for Ashura's despair. However, enemy reinforcements arrive
still on Turn 4.

        Turn 4, Player Phase - Daimos, Galva FX-II appear


   There's info the runamuck Titans are heading to the city downtown in order
to acquire new equipment. When you arrive there, you see something that seems
to be part of the newly-acquired Titan stuff: a Gundam - a particularly large
one. Kou comments Nina would faint if she saw this, and Camille senses Four's
inside it. Feeling Camille is there, Scirocco predicts amusement is coming.

   On Turn 3, several unidentified units come, including one cobra-resembling
battleship. Amuro says these must be the Barm aliens Chien talked about. They
are looking for someone called Erica, and decide to get rid of you humans so
you don't intrude.

   Right after that, Daimos and Galva FX-II appear. Kyoshirou says they came
from DaimoBig, and requests your help. Camille can convince Four, freeing her
from the Titans' brainwashing; she jumps into Camille's mobile suit while the
Psycho Gundam is destroyed.

   After the battle, Katsuya finds Erica, the one the Barm were looking for -
he doesn't know that, though. Since an enemy counterattack is very likely to
happen, Amuro tells Katsuya to put her on the Argama's Medical Office, while
you all run away.

and adjusted, Jack and Mary King are determined not to let Brocken pass.

   On Turn 2, both Getter Robo and Getter Q are ready and out - Kouji says he
missed fighting alongside them. On Turn 5, a new wave of enemies come, led by
GiruGiruGan, piloted by some mysterious guy.

   After the battle, you're left with the confirmation the Machine Beasts and
the Dinosaur Empire are also involved, and ended up clearing the road for a
different force... Some timing they have. For Jack, if they come again, they
will be defeated, so he doesn't worry.

Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (1) arrive
        Turn 5, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive


   Unidentified machines have appeared at Nishiizu City; they intend to meet
with the underground armies, according to the information you have.

   When you arrive, Dancougar catches up with you; Amuro already knew Shinobu
Fujiwara and his friends from the last war, when Dancougar delivered a consi-
derable strike to the enemy. Ryou Shiba and Masato Shikibu say this is a new
Dancougar, as it was just readapted, but Sara Yuuki cuts them and goes to the
point, offering the Beast Warrior Force's services to the Londo Bell.

   On Turn 3 more enemies appear. Akira complains they keep sending more fake
Raideens (Gildeen), but the Beast Warrior Force notices another thing: a fake
Dancougar. At first, they think it's again the work of the Ghost Empire, but
Masato has a different feel about it.

   On Turn 5, even more enemies pop up, which Amuro credits to the resources
the enemies probably gathered, and Camille again comments on the enemy's good
timing. Shinobu says this isn't the time to complain - no matter if they send
everything they have, they will be crushed the same way. Be careful with the
Guzzard: when you get close, it may self-destruct or use a map weapon on you
- either way, that hurts a lot.

   After the battle, you have wiped out almost the entire battle power of all
enemies on the Earth surface. Despite it, Amuro's worried: like Camille said,
the enemy showed some curiously good timing... The Barm invading just as the
Zeons leave the Earth, not to mention the Machine Beasts and the Ghost Empire
acting, plus the creatures that showed up at the Saotome Institute.

   Coincidentally, Fa brings in the results of the analysis on the mysterious
creatures: nothing but extraterrestrial substances in their composition. Ryou
reminds of the large Dragon robot and the fake Dancougar that appeared on the
city - no fragments of those two could be found after the battle; all of this
makes Amuro think a single person may be controling all these events.

   A transmission from Anaheim comes; it's Chien again, saying the Zeon mili-
tary commanders Giren Zabi and Kishiria Zabi were assassinated.


Scene 3: "Colony Nation"
========================

 First:   Earth Vicinities            ->  Scenario 11
 Choice:  Colony L3-X18999            ->  Scenario 12
 Choice:  Texas Colony Vicinities     ->  Scenario 13
 Last:    Earth Vicinities            ->  Scenario 14


   Shinobu mentions he missed a peaceful Earth; fortunately, things are quiet
now. Sara tells him to stop soaking in sentimentalism and go to the conferen-
ce room, but he doesn't feel like attending meetings; besides, Ryou's already
there to represent his team. He mentions several new robots came and joined;
Masato says even more new kinds of Gundams arrived, and he likes those "bug-
like robots".

   Kouji and the Getter Team drop by to say hi; Sara mentions the Getter Team
looks like they've been through hell, and Hayato says they could say the same
about her - then again, he feels tougher times are still to come.

   In response to Jinguuji's questioning about what to do from now on, Akira
says he doesn't believe all demons have been destroyed, but he wants to stay
around a little longer and see what happens.

   At the conference room, Amuro is still talking to Chien; without its lea-
ders, Zeon turned into Neo Zeon by Hamaan Khan's influence, and the leader of
Area L3's X18999 Colony Marimeia Kushurinada has declared an indepence war on
Earth - yes, they just keep piling up.

   To suppress the Neo Zeon and Marimeia independence movements, you'll need
to go to space, but you won't make it without supplies and reinforcements. He
estimates you will need two more pilots, but with the Earth forces lacking on
pilots and the ban on civilian battle machines there is no chance to find it.
Other than the Coplander Team and DaimoBig, there are no private armies left;
Dunbine comes from an unknown world, leaving you no choices...

   Suddenly, Captain Quattro Bajina appears and tells you to be careful about
words or acts that may lower the troops' morale - it may be impolite. He in-
troduces himself and says he was just assigned to the Londo Bell. Also, Lalah
came along to assist. Upon seeing Lalah, Amuro realizes Quattro is actually
Char, but keeps it to himself and suggests hurrying up to space and stop the
Barm.

   Speaking of the Barm, Bright remembers of the girl Katsuya saved and asks
what happened to her; she is still at the medical office, and apparently lost
her memory. Since there are no field hospitals around, she has to stay, which
reminds Bright of the White Base days...

   At space, Richter tries to contact Commander Orban to confirm his orders
to leave the Earth Sphere. Worried about his sister Erica, Richter decides to
go search her by himself; his mentor Aizam decides to go too.

                      Suit) or $10000 or BioSensor or Chobham Armor
Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   The Londo Bell goes to space, just to be ambushed by Cima. Kou notices the
GP-02A is there as well; the GP-02A is the machine who caused the annullment
of the Antarctic Treaty, surprisingly now in the hands of the Zeons.

   Kou can talk to Gato, and ask why Earthnoids and Spacenoids are fighting,
having once been allies. Gato answers it's only natural that grudges start to
surface once a fight begins; however, he is not the kind of person that kills
only for ressentment - he stands for honor and justice; Kou tries to convince
him the Londo Bell isn't fighting for ressentment either, but Gato won't join
you.

   On Turn 3, Kelly arrives with more mobile suits, and his MA Val Valo isn't
weak either. The units that may give you problems are, of course, the GP-02A
and the Gerbera Tetra (by the way, the GP-02A uses its shield often, making
it a pain to kill). The Big Zam is also hard to beat, unless you have a good
Super Robot lineup.

   After the battle, there's a chance you receive a GP-02A or a Gerbera Tetra
as a Stage Clear bonus - I suggest you save the game before you kill the last
enemy and try again and again until you get either one; notice they're not as
strong as the ones Gato and Cima piloted in this scenario.

Events: Turn 3, Player Phase - Wing Zero Custom, Deathscythe H Custom appear


   With Crossbone Vanguard's support, Marimeia declared war against the Earth
Union Government. The idea is to go to her colony and suppress her revolt.

   Inside the colony, Wufei regards you as a worthy opponent; Camille is very
surprised to see Gundams there - especially unknown type ones. Amuro can only
sense both sides' pilots are quite perplexed.

   On Turn 3, Heero and Duo appear and try to convince Trowa and Wufei not to
fight anymore. For a second, Bright thinks they're surrounded by the enemies,
until a girl called Noin contacts you and presents these two as members of
Preventer, an order-maintenance institution established by the Haran zaibatsu (zaibatsu=financial clique).

   She explains the two Gundams over there are actually their allies and asks
for your help; Heero just wants you not to interfere, but Duo disagrees.

   Heero can talk to Wufei, and ask why is he using his Gundam to spread war
and confusion, and exorts him to push the self-destruct switch. Wufei agrees
- not about the self-destruct, but about the rest. Duo can talk to Trowa, and
ask the reason of his betrayal, but Trowa only tries to convince Duo he's not
Trowa, that he's got the wrong person (...).

   After the battle, Duo tells they've heard about you from Noin, and want to
help you; Heero says Marimeia is heading towards Earth, so they want to go in
order to fight it. Because Preventer was established by Banjou's family Amuro
sees no reason to doubt their information, plus he also felt Wufei and Trowa
have more motivations...

   A help signal is received, and its ID call indicate it comes from someone
you know from the last war - Judou Ashita. Judou and Roux were caught by the
enemy while the ZZ Gundam's energy is drained. The enemy is led by Mashmar,
excited at the idea of getting two weakened Gundams and helping Hamaan.

   The Londo Bell appears on Turn 3 to save the day; Bright says Judou better
return the ZZ Gundam to where it belongs once this battle ends, and get ready
to face some punishment; Judou says he's just as screwed, with or without his
friends... that's the price to pay, Lina says.

   Seeing Judou and Puru appear at the same scenario, you may be planning to
have Judou talk to her... Forget it, it doesn't happen here. After the battle
take a look at the pilot status screen to see Judou's sister Lina is a pilot
too!

        Turn 5, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   Having beaten the enemy force at the trap set for you at the X18999 Colony
your team prepares to land back on Earth. Wufei, however, is waiting for you.
There are a lot of enemies, but you have no choice.

   Put Heero to talk to Wufei and he'll ask if that's the justice Wufei talks
so much about; Wufei tells him to look around: even after the Muge and Mega-
noids, Earth hasn't changed a bit. Heero says fighting like that won't change
things, but Wufei is convinced that'll help people get over the Earth against
space antagonism.

   On the end of Turn 5, some unidentified mechs appear to scare Bright; Daba
and friends are just as confused as Bright, having crossed some strange void
and somehow ended in a completely different star system. Lacey comments they
end up in battles even when they don't want to...

   By the end of the next enemy phase more robots appear, led by Nei and her
men; Gabley soon notices they are in the middle of a battle, but Nei doesn't
care about anything other than catching the leader of the revolutionary army,
Daba Mylord, and orders no mercy to anyone standing in the way.

   After the battle, Bright says because they weren't able to stop Marimeia's
forces from landing on Earth, so you team is now entering a pursuit battle...
Daba thanks your help, and introduces himself; Amuro asks what colony do they
come from.

   Kyao knows nothing about colonies, and says they came from a place called
Pentagona; Amu asks what's this place, with a single sun and stuff, but Lacey
tells her if she's going to make things more complicated she better shut up.
She explains they came from a star system called Pentagona World and got lost
here, leaving Bright and Amuro a bit skeptical.

   The presence of Lilith Fau - a faerie - makes Amuro accept they're really
aliens, so he is ready to listen...

 Last:    South America/Jaburo        ->  Scenario 21


   Marimeia Kushurinada advocates the doctrine of Cosmo Aristocracy, and in-
tends to empower the Crossbone Vanguard, just like the Zeons did with Minerva
Zabi at the previous war. Heero wonders who is the one to be manipulated by
Marimeia and presented as leader, but Duo is more concerned about Wufei and
Trowa's change of sides.

   When meeting Lacey, Shinobu says aliens look way better than he expected;
she thanks and says he looks great too - Sara tells Shinobu to stop ashaming
the human race and behave. The sight of aliens also seem to trigger something
on Erica...

   Having several enemies, including the Marimeia and Poseidal armies, Bright
doesn't know what to do. Amuro says there is no choice: either way, they have
to land on Earth and crush the enemies one by one. When Akira comes, they ask
him to keep calm: a Preventer transmission just informed the Ghost Empire is
moving once again.

   Akira takes it quite easily; actually, he already knew that - Raideen told
him. However, before he can ask everyone to chase them again, Amuro tells him
forces that call themselves the 'Mikeene Empire' and 'Hundred Devils Empire'
have appeared at the same time. Akira knows nothing about those last two, and
Bright says not much more can go wrong...

   The Marimeia forces have successfully landed on Earth; however, the Argama
is still planning a late atmospheric entry...

   At Earth, Zechs and Noin face a much larger enemy force; Zechs encourages
Noin to leave, but she refuses to - this city was chosen to house the united
presidential offices, and if it is taken over by war nothing will go forward.
Dekin says it's hopeless - since the Earth Union lost its power and the Zeons
were taken over by confusion, gaining control over the Earth surface became
simple.

   Quatre, Wufei (if Heero convinced him on the previous scenarios) and Trowa
appear to reinforce you on Turn 3, explaining they pretended to betray you in
order to gain access to inside information. Marimeia curses them, but intends
to make their efforts worthless. The Londo Bell arrives only on Turn 4.

   After the battle, Bright decides to deliver the captured Marimeia to Pre-
venter; however, she is just a child - a puppet controlled by the Crossbone
Vanguard.

   One of your new enemies, the Mikeene Empire, heads to the Saotome Institu-
te to obtain the super energy Getter Beam. Their leader, the Drakness Great
General, doesn't know the exact nature of the power overflowing from the Ins-
titute, but fears it will be an obstacle to their surface invasion plans.

   The General's musings are interrupted by Ryou and the Londo Bell, who had
already arrived there, for the General's surprise; Hayato answers that's the
idea - Getter Liger had been hiding underground just so he would think he was
alone.

   One of the enemy soldiers, Tekkou Ki, reminds the General he had promised
Tekkou Ki would be granted a one-on-one fight against Getter, but the General
tells Tekkou not to bother him with trivial matters, and says he doesn't care
about Tekkou's humanisms.

   You can have Ryou talk to Tekkou Ki (it doesn't matter which mode Getter's
in, you can use the persuade command anyway), and Tekkou will say he is here
to have a duel with Getter. Hayato asks why is a soldier like him helping the
surface invasion forces, and Ryou promises him a duel if he leaves the enemy
army, so Tekkou Ki joins you.

   On Turn 4, a new wave of enemies come, at the bottom center of the screen,
but they're not strong (but they have high HPs, so try to keep a few units by
there to kill them sooner - by now, you should have killed almost all enemies
but the General and a couple others).

   You receive the information insect-resembling military units have suddenly
appeared, and go check it out.

   Drake has somehow surfaced, not happy to meet Shou and the surface people
who fought him (which he regards as your betrayal); Marvel says at last the
Bistonwell inhabitants kicked him out of their world. Drake quickly refuses
any sympathy she may feel: his forces here are sufficient, and, if Bistonwell
is no longer available, then he will make this place his second home - and
conquer it.

   When you destroy Jeril's Leprechaun, it goes Hyper mode instead of leaving
and she rises to level 31; she wouldn't leave just yet, as she thinks battles
are entertaining... Her kiryoku also rose to 130, making the Hyper Leprechaun
a pain to kill, because of its Bunshin skill.

   Once you destroy all enemies, the battle against the Drake forces is over,
but Shou remembers Cham their quest isn't finished yet - after the war, they
will try and find out a way to return to Bistonwell.

   Sheila appears calling for Shou; she was imprisoned at the Will Wipps, and
saw the whole fight before escaping - she found your performance magnificent.
Inside the Will Wipps, there was a new Aura Battler model; she recovered it
from the wreckages, but thinks it's useless now that Drake's gone. Shou tells
her their battle isn't over yet, so you receive the Billbine! Also, two Aura
Battler faeries join your party: Elle and Belle.

   Unidentified enemies are advancing towards the Haran family, Shinza City's
great millionaires. As they draw closer, Garrison, Beauty and Reika begin to
worry; Banjou mentions that although Daitarn hasn't been used since the last
war, they have been contributing to Preventer - a fact that was left at total
secrecy. They probably know about it, and plan to cut Preventer's funding.

   Garrison suggests they prepare for battle, as the Londo Bell will soon be
there to help as well. You arrive at Turn 3 to save the day; Amu is impressed
by Banjou's mansion, and wonders how it'd be like living with Daba there...
Sara says these aliens are pretty heedless, while Shinobu notices the enemies
are Muge units - something is wrong.

   More Zangaiohs and a couple of GiruGiruGans come on Turn 4, 5 and 6. On 7,
the Dragon-like robot you fought at Scenario 10 appears again. Just like the
first time, it may self-destruct on you, so be careful.

   After the battle, Banjou offers Bright his and Daitarn 3's services, which
Bright wishes to accept, but the Daitarn 3 is one of the forbidden use mechs.
Garrison has the idea of claiming the Daitarn 3 was only used for self-defen-
se, and Bright cannot resist the fact its presence would increase your battle
power a lot - a real lot.

   As Bright is willing to accept the responsibility for accepting Daitarn 3
in, Beauty, Reika and Garrison get ready to come along - the three are pilots
as well - while Amuro jokingly says being responsible is painful...

   In order to obtain the Mutron secrets, the Ghost Empire stages an all-out
attack on the Mutron Research Laboratory. Since you pop up there to prevent
their success, Sharkin vows to wipe you out. Ryou comments they came in very
high numbers, and they're so impatient the boss himself came out this time.

   Upon noticing they've launched everything they have, Akira says that's the
moment he expected: this victory is the moment Raideen was ressuscitated for.
On Turn 5, a new batch of enemies come, a Fake Dancougar among them.

   If you launched Raideen during this stage, on Turn 10 the same mysterious
voice that called Akira to board Raideen now urges him to shout "God Ramuh" -
Ramuh, the mysterious voice explains, is the name of the king who rose the Mu
continent to greatness. By doing this, Raideen gains a new weapon: God Voice,
a devastating MAP attack! Plus, Raideen has its agility risen by 20 points
(without upgrades, it goes from 75 to 95).

   After you defeat all enemies Akira says at last they reached a conclusion,
but he isn't satisfied; there are forces other than the Ghost Empire still at
large, and Sharkin's group was apparently just a curtain for them.

   The Barm aliens, which were thought to have left the Earth Sphere, appear
once again with some new forces. Richter presents himself, and lets clear his
plans of killing the Londo Bell; there are one billion Barms wandering across
the space, and they want the Earth for themselves to live peacefully in.

   Katsuya berates the Barms' selfishness, while the sound of Richter's voice
starts to bring Erica's memory back. Richter calls you foolish - for actively
seeking your own sacrifice and mayhem - and urges you to give up your useless
resistance. By then, Erica remembers that, to break free from the rigid con-
trol over her life, she came down to the Earth surface, and that Richter's
her brother.

   If Katsuya talks to Richter, he'll ask whether it's true he is Erica's ol-
der brother, but it only makes Richter furious about what he considers to be
her betrayal, associating herself with the earthlings he hates so much; from
now on, he says, she's no longer his sister, nor a Barm. She tries to explain
she's in love with Katsuya, surprising Richter.

   After the battle, Erica credits their chance meeting with Richter to fate,
and regrets the man she loves and and her brother are old enemies...

Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   Jaburo was completely destroyed!... Right in the center of the debris is
the Muge Emperor, not dead as Shinobu thought, and as Ryou Shiba deduces, the
one behind all the coordinated surface invasions. Muge defines himself as a
space god, and his goal is to lead the foolish mankind to his world; in other
words, drive them into space.

   Sheila is terrified at his evil intentions, and says it'd throw the entire
area into an endless spiral of hatred. Shinobu says Dancougar is meant to cut
through evil and, no matter how many times evil rises, Dancougar will always
crush it.

   You can have Ryou persuade Kochou Ki (like you did with Tekkou Ki, it does
not matter which mode Getter is in, you can use the persuade command anyway);
at first Kochou resists, but Ryou says they're not meant to fight each other,
as this invasion was arranged by Muge. She claims she's a devil, and as such
could never live alongside humans, but Benkei disagrees: someday this day'll
come, and they fight to make it possible. Kochou decides to believe, for once
in her life, and joins you.

   On Turn 3, a group of Aura Battlers appear, led by Burn Bannings, or Black
Knight; Shou is surprised he's still alive, but he says he won't die until he
defeats Shou. Sheila says she has never felt such evil-driven Aura Power, and
Shou says he doesn't murder people, and will only kill his hatred.

   Things aren't so easy, however: when you destroy Black Knight's Galava, it
goes hyper, with all the stuff it brings - high HP, risen kiryoku, et cetera.
Cham asks Shou what to do now, but he only knows he can't go hyper himself -
it would imply having nothing but bad Aura Power, and he'd kill everyone this
way.

   If Dancougar attacks Muge within 7 turns, Muge calls you pathetic spirits,
and says you will be driven to space. In response, Shinobu says their loving
hearts will cut through all evil spaces; he names it "Dankuu-Kouga-Ken" - a
powerful MAP weapon! On the bad side, Dancougar's armor drops 200 points.

   After you get rid of Muge and all other enemies, Kouji says the enemies on
the Earth surface have all been pacified and all super robot pilots celebrate
their victory against their respective arch-enemies.

   Akira and Tetsuya comment on how the Ghost, Mikeene and Hundred Devils Em-
pires were seduced by Muge's promise of power; Banjou says these events also
caused Raideen to ressurrect, and made all battle forces that fought them in
the past to associate - this is what defeated Muge.

   Judou reminds there's no reason to think it's over, as Crossbone Vanguard
probably won't withdraw with this, and there are still the Barm. Speaking of
which, Katsuya asks Bright not to do anything against Erica for being a Barm,
and Richter's sister; Bright has no plans for Erica, but asks her to stay in
her quarters until the fighting is over.

   For Quattro, it would be good to return to space soon, as he suspects Ha-
maan may have started moving. Camille asks how could it be, since they last
heard the Zeons would not recover from the Giren Zabi assassination incident.
Quattro asks him to think well: when he ran across Four, where did the with-
drawing forces ran to? And, when the Londo Bell saved Judou, most enemy MSs
were new models. It all implies they're not crumbling as you thought.

   The events on the landing of the Marimeia Army can't be overlooked either
- Quattro thinks the intervention of the Poseidal forces seemed artificial.
Amuro too asks for Bright to go to space, as he's got a bad feeling about all
this, and Daba is concerned about Poseidal's activities, as anyone can cross
that void they came through and come to this solar system.

   Bright says there are too many unknown variables now to understand what is
going on, and with the Muge Emperor defeated there's no way to know what may
come from the remaining Muges as well. Fa interrupts the discussion to report
a transmission coming from the newly-completed Ral Kairam: Chien reports pro-
blems with a space colony and the Earth...

   In Space, the same mysterious two now discuss Muge's defeat, and say they
had a lot of hopes put on that "awesome hatred power". One asks for the other
to be patient - there are progress being made and the results will soon show
up...

   By now, your team is already in space and inside the Ral Kairam. About the
colony issue Chien mentioned earlier, a Neo Zeon special force, Delaz Fleet,
has hijacked a Space Colony during its transport, and headed it towards Earth
to obliterate its residents. Banjou estimates the landing of a colony-level
mass would blow off an area the size of Japan.

   Daba can't believe they would mass-murder their own peers, who live in the
same star system, and Amuro answers you fight to stop such things, and trust
mankind will have the power to reform itself after all this is over. Fa cal-
culates you can capture the colony (just barely) before it reaches the limit
point of obstruction - after which it's impossible to stop the colony. Bright
orders you go there at full speed, of course.

   Amuro finds out what she was discussing with Chien previously is at last
completed: the RX-93... the Nu Gundam. Its funnels' power is unknown, leaving
it dependent of Amuro's limits only. Amuro also noticed a new large mech an-
chored: it's the third unit of the Gundam Experiment, the GP-03 Dendrobium.
It was brought to the Londo Bell due to Anaheim's Nina Purpleton's influence.
Chien is worried they may not be able to stop the colony, but Amuro tells her
to trust the Fin Funnels he initially designed and she perfected...

   After allowing the Marimeia forces to land on the Earth, Neo Zeon is now
staging a colony drop. Bright says there were workers inside that colony, and
establishes the defense line must be protected at any cost. Kou notices Gato
is inside a new model mobile armor, and Quattro is a tad upset to see they're
using the Ziong as well - it implies the Delaz Fleet brought its full power.

   Kou can talk to Gato; Gato doesn't even want to listen; he says everything
there was to be said already was: he stands for justice and won't budge. Once
Kou tried talking with Gato, you can send Quattro to do the same. Quattro ex-
plains there's no justice in the current Zeon - the late Zabis took advantage
of that ideal as much as possible - and asks how can't he see who is the true
enemy.

   Once Gato realizes Quattro is Char, he asks how can the son of Zeon Daikun
help the Earth Union; Quattro answers the Zabi House just used the Zeon name
to deceive the people. At last, Gato understands, and, for the sake of true
justice, decides to trust your cause.

   After the battle, Garrison says they calculate the colony will now fly by
the Earth, instead of colliding with it. Bright wants to move on immediately
and get rid of Neo Zeon and the Crossbone Vanguard.

   Scirocco, who had been maneuvering inside the Titans, finally started to
attack by himself. When you arrive, Scirocco says when you stopped the colony
drop you wasted a chance to get rid of those "ordinary people" whose spirits
are bound by gravity. When Kouji says they won't let him attack the Earth he
lives in, Scirocco replies the deaths of those who cannot understand genius
doesn't bother him, as genius is surely the driving power of the world.

   Daba says Scirocco is just like Poseidal, and fears even in this space the
same errors may be comitted. Camille says he won't allow people like him, who
laugh at others from outside, to escape.

   Camille can persuade Rozamia; she says something like "the sky is falling"
and that you're responsible for it, making Camille angry to see Four was not
the only one whose mind Scirocco tampered with. Rozamia confuses Camille with
her brother, and he plays along; he says the Gundam she's piloting is what is
inflicting so much pain to her, and tells her to abandon it. She obeys, drops
out of the Psycho Gundam Mk-II, which is destroyed, and goes with Camille.

   After you defeat all enemies, Camille says with this kind of people around
the fighting will never end, and Fa can say little to comfort him... If you
had Rozamia join you, her nickname changes to "Rozamie" and you also gain a
Bound Doc.

   Neo Zeon is based at Asteroid Axis, and their leader Hamaan Khan is prepa-
ring... Hamaan calls you a major obstacle, and has bad feelings about this,
also because of Char's presence on your side.

   These news take Bright by surprise, but Amuro tells him to calm down - he
already knew Quattro is Char, and also suspects he may have killed the former
Zeon leader Giren Zabi. Hamaan says it's too bad he left, since on her hands
Zeon managed to rise again; however, it's not too late, and if he decides to
come back... Quattro says he wants to fight for his own purposes, and accuses
Hamaan of preventing mankind of 'awakening' into newtypes.

   This time Judou can talk to Puru; because of the weird feeling he has near
her, he asks who is she. Puru too feels good near him, and wonders whether he
wants to play with her; he agrees, and calls her to your side. She hesitates,
and Judou gets to revolt a little about how they turned a little child into a
killing machine. After Judou insists a little more, Puru joins you.

   After the battle, Lalah asks whether Char/Quattro is really happy with the
way things came out; he answers the Zabi House betrayed the Zeon name, and as
such he won't miss them... things are okay. He is about to explain himself to
Bright, but Bright just says once everyone is back in the ship, they'll go to
the next point; he refers to Char as Quattro and pretends nothing happened.

   A distress signal is coming from Frontier I - very close to the Crossbone
Vanguard headquarters. There, Seabook is asking Cecily how could she convince
him to take part on that awful plan of hers. She answers he can pick whatever
explanation he wants, and he suggests she may be trying to return to the Rona
House, her family.

   She reassures him she's still Cecily Fairchild, and he says their distress
signal was already sent, so now it's go there and see what they can get out
of this situation. On the enemy side, Carozzo/Iron Mask says the construction
of Cosmo Babilonia is the way for mankind to survive throughout eternity, and
a thousand-year dream of his Rona House; and, if Cecily can't understand its
meaning, then she's completely out of reach.

   The Londo Bell arrives on Turn 4; Carozzo refers to you as those who re-
pelled Marimeia, and considers you a perfect opponent for a test. When Amuro
ask what's this test for, Carozzo says if the results are satisfactory, he'll
immediately release his Bugs on the Moon and Earth... A perfect operation, he
says, as it doesn't even hurt consciousnesses anymore.

   Seabook says Iron Mask plans to cause massive killings with those spinning
things, which Carozzo defines as accomplishing the doctrine of Cosmo Aristo-
cracy via mechanical, unintentional amendments. Obviously, you can't let this
happen.

   The bugs are actually quite easy kills, since they're not strong, and only
attack by tackling their enemy. The Bugs the Lafressia uses are a different
tale: those are pretty strong, as is the Lafressia as a whole. Once you beat
all enemies, time to move on.

other than Muge; Banjou wants less talk and more fighting for now.

   On Turn 3, a group of mobile suits appear from one side, and heavy metals
from the other. Daba is stunned with the sight of heavy metals, while Quattro
notices the MSs are for newtype use. Furthermore, someone else comes; Banjou
understands he is the one pulling all the wires, and explains to Bright he is
just like Muge - an apparition from the last war: Don Zauser!

   After the battle, you find out most of your people only know Don Zauser by

   A reminder of the last war, the Poseidal Army started to stage an invasion
from a fragment of the Muge Space. Giwaza greets Daba (he calls him Kamon),
and communicates that, by order of Poseidal, he'll be destroyed. He also says
Daba is not the only reason he came here for - Poseidal is very pleased with
what she heard about this star system.

   Amu and Lacey can't believe Poseidal may want to extend their war to here.
Daba tells Bright his group will take care of them, and everybody else should
leave. Instead, Bright orders a full deployment, saying even if he called for
a withdraw, more than half of the pilots wouldn't obey - so, better step for-
ward. Besides, if the enemy intends to bring the war to this side, than it is
their problem too.

   Daba can talk to Kwathan, apparently his sister (she normally doesn't move
until you get close, but you can use the Chouhatsu/Provocation seishin to at-
tract her); he submits her will is being controlled by Poseidal, and insists
she comes back to his side. She manages to break free from Poseidal's control
and joins you.

   Having Kwathan on your team, you can have her persuade Gabley; she reminds
him he vowed to protect her on several occasions; leaving Gabley disoriented.
Then, make Daba talk to him: Gabley accuses Daba of tricking Kwathan somehow,
but Daba insists he just 'fixed' her. Gabley confesses he doesn't feel very
fond for Poseidal right now, and decides to help you - as long as it's clear
he is not doing it because of Daba's words, but for his love for Kwathan. If
Hassha is alive by the time Gabley joins you, he too joins you.

   After the battle, Bright intends to drive through the Muge Space fragment,
and reach Pentagona World, in order to thrash the Poseidal Army's main head-
quarters. Ryou Shiba never thought he would enter the Muge Space again, as he
doesn't have the best recollections of it - Daba, on the other hand, is glad
to leave this world, as he cannot quite understand it: too many civilians in
military positions, and he misses his freedom of movement...

   Bright explains to Daba the Londo Bell is an 'independent raid squad', and
he was entrusted the decision-making power on occasions like this: some intel
reports that, a while ago, the Neo Zeon remnants migrated towards Pentagona!
Amuro asks where did this intel come from, as he never heard about it. Bright
says it was left secret because the transmission source is unknown, and there
are chances it's a fake - the transmission was interrupted very abruptly, and
it also was in a very formal code, so it could very well be a trap.

   However, Chien says right after Hamaan's defeat unknown MS coming this way
suddenly stopped, so she thinks the information is good. Plus, there are also
the Barms: looks like Small Barm is pulling out to Pentagona too. One of your
tasks is to confirm whether they gave up their Earth invasion plans or not -
if not, Bright says, Katsuya should get ready for the worst...

   Bright says they'll help Daba defeat Poseidal later, but for now they need
his assistance. Daba doesn't mind giving you a hand now, as even if they beat
Poseidal and Giwaza they would still have to deal with the scattered Koam Li-
beration Army.

   When Katsuya leaves the meeting room, Kouji asks why does he look so sour;
Katsuya gives an evasive answer and leaves to Erica's quarters. Kouji wonders
what's wrong with him, and Nana says he's lovesick. Noin finds this forbidden
human-and-alien love thing romantic, and Sayaka says Kouji will understand it
when he feels love burning inside himself.

   Kouji suddenly realizes he's surrounded by girls, and asks where the hell
they all came from. Marvel says it's a girl thing: they really love this kind
of talk. Very soon, Beauty, Reika, Chris and Sara show up to talk about love
and sigh for their beloved too... Seeing it will only get worse, Kouji leaves
while he can.

   At Erica's room, Katsuya says he is sorry she has to be locked there alone
all the time, but Erica doesn't mind: Cham and Lilith come every now and then
to play... and Katsuya goes there often too. He lets her know the Londo Bell
is going after Small Barm, and if Richter's still alive Katsuya might have to
fight him again, as well as the other Barms...

   Erica reassures Katsuya she loves him no matter what; the Barms were given
no choice but to leave their home world, but invading the Earth is wrong, and
Katsuya must fight to defend his planet. She can also understand her brother,
though - as Commander Orban is holding all the political power on Small Barm,
he alone might be the cause of this entire war. Katsuya promises he'll defeat
Orban, so the earthlings and the Barms have a chance of living together.

   At Pentagona, Poseidal learns Daba Mylord is coming, and with new allies -
just like herself. While she dreams about being the last face Daba ever sees,
Fratt asks whether it wouldn't be the time to be moderate. Poseidal reaffirms
her position as the ruler of Pentagona World, and will defend her home. Fratt
says the times have changed, and Daba grew in strenght. Poseidal's completely
sure she can overpower anyone, for she's Poseidal. And, on her beloved Penta-
gona, only lovable people shall live - that's her duty.

   If your total turn count is 250 or less, a message says the Getter's reac-
tor ran out of control, and you receive the Shin Getter Robo (?)!

Events: Turn 4, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   By associating with Poseidal, Commander Orban has managed to increase his
power to invade the Earth. As soon as you enter Small Barm, Erica asks why is
Orban doing this, as it doesn't help the one billion Barm people; Orban reaf-
firms it does: Poseidal's power will have Earth fall in their hands.

   Daba tries to argue Orban does not understand Poseidal and is being naive,
but Orban won't budge, and is ready to start his operation... a brainwashing
operation he intends to apply on his people to ensure their loyalty. Katsuya
says those who love Barm - like Richter - would never let it happen without a
fight. Orban laughs at this possibility, and says it is about time to abandon
Richter anyway.

   If Katsuya persuaded Richter on Scenario 20, Richter and Aizam appear now;
they found out about Orban's plot, and decide to join Katsuya for the sake of
all one billion Barms. He also asks Erica to forgive her selfish brother, and
accept his actions as being for the good of the Barms.

   On Turn 4 some Heavy Metals pop up at the bottom of the screen - Poseidal
is determined to waste you. Still, they shouldn't be a problem to a good unit
lineup.

   To invade the Poseidal main citadel, Sveat, you must break an established
defense line. Giwaza is convinced that with the addition of Earth battle for-
ces Poseidal's time has come. Daba complains again they shouldn't have called
in people from other star systems, as this is a Pentagona matter; Giwaza ans-
wers that, with this naive thinking, Daba's revolutionary army will certainly
fall before Poseidal. Lacey and Kyao say all of this exceeds Giwaza's duties
with Poseidal, and that he doesn't have the power to carry such a burden.

   Amu can persuade Fratt; she asks why is Fratt helping Poseidal; Fratt only
answers the world of the adults is a complex one. Amu replies she too can un-
derstand when a mistake is being made, and asks whether Fratt would not stop
fighting. Seeing Amu approach Fratt more and more, Daba tells Amu not to keep
adoring any adults.

   After Amu talked to Fratt, send Daba to do the same: he asks why can't she
understand Amu's feelings, and urges her to do the right thing one more time.
Impressed with the power you kids showed, Fratt says she will be a child once
again and joins you.

   When you defeat Giwaza, he talks to himself: why didn't those who informed
him about the loophole to Earth intervened more than they did? It could have
made a difference...

   After the battle, Amuro worries about what they just heard - somebody lea-
ked information to the enemy? Banjou has a theory: the decision of defeating
the Londo Bell there was made much earlier...

   In order to obtain control over Zeon, Gremmi Toto joins Poseidal and chal-
lenges the Londo Bell. Upon arrival, you find yourself surrounded by both Neo
Zeon's mobile suits and Poseidal's Heavy Metals. Daba curses Poseidal for in-
volving humans into their fight, as if the Barms weren't enough.

   By using Hamaan's fall as argument, Quattro tries to convince Gremmi it is
still too soon for the Zeon restoration to come (for Amuro's concern). Hamaan
had already told Gremmi about Char Aznable, so he considers Char the shame of
Zeon and promises to rebuild the Reign of Zeon's Blood with his own hands, at
any cost.

   Judou says the blood Gremmi talks so much about came from Earth - the Zabi
House's blood is just the last small fraction of a story millions years old.
Until people like him - petty enough who worry about such little things - are
defeated, mankind will never start over, and will never see the future.

   Amuro can persuade Quess; sensing her innocence, he asks for her name, and
immediately calls her to your side, saying that serving those who aim nothing
but others' deaths will eventually kill herself.

   You can also have Judou talk to Puru Two; at first, he becomes confused at
sensing another Puru; Puru eventually understands and explains to Judou that
Puru Two is her clone. Puru Two says she won't let herself be fooled by Judou
like Puru did. Judou says they're only using her, and that she's not more im-
portant to them than a puppet, but it doesn't work.

   After that, send Puru to talk to her - Puru Two still resists; Judou says
she's becoming a very obedient person at heart, and she didn't use to be like
that. Taking that as an insult, Puru Two joins you pretty much just to prove
Judou wrong.

   After the battle, Quattro says his blood too may have become impure, since
he abandoned his birthname Cassoval. Lalah tries to comfort him, but he still
insists he is fine, and everything is okay...

Events: Turn 4, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (1) arrive
        After Poseidal is defeated - Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive


   At Sveat, Daba and his teammates at last get their chance to face Poseidal
and finish the conflict she started, and Kouji lets know Earth is also repre-
sented there. Still confident, Poseidal calls you foolish and says it's about
time for the rebellious to realize her frightening power.

   Fratt can talk to Poseidal (who she calls Mian) and try to convince her to
stop this play, as they both already suffered enough. Poseidal calls this a
nonsense and reaffirms she's Ordona Poseidal; Fratt asks why is Poseidal's
Bio-Relation failing then, and regrets Mian sold her body and heart over to
Poseidal, which leaves Amu confused - after all, they're talking to Poseidal,
aren't they?

   The turn after you defeat Poseidal, a new batch of enemies appears, led by
one Amandra, who says he never thought he himself would have to show up. To
Daba (who he calls Kamon), he says Poseidal's terror started at the same time
of the Yahman family's requiem.

   Since this isn't the first time Daba's called Kamon, Bright asks for ex-
planations. Turns out Daba's the sole survivor of the Yahman dynasty, over-
thrown during Poseidal's war to unify Pentagona: his real name is Kamon My-
lord. Lacey isn't sure it's okay to reveal the truth, but Daba thinks this is
the least he can do after using the Londo Bell for so long. Amuro and Kouji
don't feel used, though: Daba's their friend and they'd join this fight for
peace no matter what.

   Amandra cuts off the talk, as it's time to put an end to the Yahman blood
and perfect his Bio-Relation. Akira notices his mech's power is rising a lot,
but not the same way Raideen does. This is the Bio-Relation they talk so much
about: converting a person's vital energy into power. Daba promises to defeat
Amandra - Poseidal, that is - and put an end to all this in the name of the
Yahman bloodline.

   After the battle, Daba can't quite believe it's over, and Kouji calls it a
great victory for justice. Kyao, however, is concerned about the Muge Space:
that passage is bound to bring much more trouble - Lilith and Cham, however,
oppose closing it, since it'd be impossible to meet their new friends without
it.

   Banjou is thinking about the enemy's latest moves - there's a lot of unex-
plained things about them. Camille says they've destroyed an army almost as
large as the one they fought at the Mars final battle of the last war - Judou
says this one was as pestering as the last one, but the part where the main
enemy appeared was pretty surprising.

   Because Shou wasn't around at the last war, he asks for explanations about
it; Banjou explains Muge Zorbados was an intellectual leader from outer space
- no need to tell what kind of person he was. Don Zauser, on the other hand,
was created by humans: the Meganoid Project planned to strenghten the fragile
humans, so the earthnoids could leave the overcrowded Earth and for the spa-
cenoids to expand further into space. An artificial innovation - Souzou Haran
wouldn't wait for mankind to wake up naturally.

   Souzou Haran was Banjou's father. During an experiment, an accident made
the two prototype Meganoids (Don and Korosu) run a faulty program and caused
them to declare war on all mankind, totally opposed to their original purpose
and methods - their inability to make that kind of judgment was their fatal
flaw.

   Just then, you receive a message from the Preventer HQ's Lady An: someone
has declared war against Earth's mankind! Duo and Quatre are surprised - on
the Earth Sphere, there's no army strong enough to conduct such an operation,
which leads Trowa to the logical conclusion: it comes from outside Earth. As
Fa receives further details, the identities of the war proclaimers is known:
Meganoid Korosu and...


Scene 7: "Axis... Last Battle"
==============================

 First:   Earth Vicinities - Axis     -> Scenario 32
 Last:    Inside Axis                 -> Scenario 33


   The meganoids' intent is to drive mankind to other planets; by killing all
humans on Earth, the remaining ones will lose all their will to fight and li-
ve peacefully far away. Their previous plans of destroying Earth, as well as
the rebirth of Muge, were ruined by the Londo Bell; now, with Neo Zeon's de-
feat, Korosu launched the now empty asteroid Axis to beat both the Londo Bell
and Banjou. By putting Axis in a collision route to Earth, Korosu launched a
threat to all humans, and will have all mankind kneel before Don Zauser.

   Back at Pentagona, the Londo Bell finishes all preparations and rushes in-
to the Muge Space, to intercept Axis. As the Ral Kairam gets closer, Quattro
grows concerned; Lalah asks why, but already understands that place means a
lot to him. Quattro says there's nothing left of him there - from now on it's
only Quattro Bajina.

   Amuro plans your first strike should destroy Axis' nozzle, and only then
go for its main body. Bright says both the Earth Union and Preventer fleets
are attacking Axis already without much success, but Amuro wants to blast it
up from the inside: they have information on tunnels that can lead them deep
into the asteroid.

   Kouji says things are getting interesting, and Sayaka berates him for his
imprudence, but Ryou says this time things do look promising. Duo asks Heero
what to do, since this one seems really dangerous. Heero just answers he's in
the mood to land there, and gets berated by Trowa, who thinks this is pretty
reckless, but Quatre thinks Trowa's just as eager to land on Axis.

   Lilith's already inviting Cham for a visit after the war, but Kyao reminds
her Cham and her friends are returning to Bistonwell after this. Banjou sees
the people from all these different worlds fighting together, and vows to let
Korosu feel a taste of this cooperation.

   The fleets attacking Axis mange to destroy its nozzle, leaving the Londo
Bell three levels away from being able to explode the place. Bright wants to
deal with the Meganoid ambush forces before they have the chance to attack,
while Camille says this time it goes to the very end.


Scenario 32 (Earth Vicinities - Axis) - "Korosu"

Clear Bonus - Always: Fatima
Events: none


   Axis is moving towards Earth, and you must stop its core pulse engines at
any cost. Korosu's not pleased to see Banjou interfering yet again, and asks
why can't he understand Don's feelings. Banjou says he hates the cyborgs his
father, poisoned by the idea of human improvement and experimenting with hu-
man lives, built: these meganoids, pretense super-humans.

   Korosu says this is the time for humans to break free from Earth's gravi-
ty, and fly freely in space - Don Zauser's correct. Amuro comments she's fol-
lowing that same 'gravity-bound spirit' talk, like many others...

   This stage is surprisingly easy - you don't need your top units to take
down the Aiais, but keep in mind that, even though you can launch mobile ar-
mors here, they'll be ground-bound (and therefore extremely weak) unless you
use Minovsky Crafts. Korosu's Aiai is much stronger than the rest, but even
she won't last very long.

   When you beat Meganoid Korosu, Banjou says she serves as a good example:
her feelings towards Don Zauser are nothing but love, and she's turning into
a meganoid with no other goal in life. These words hit Korosu as true, be-
fore she escapes.

   Now there's little time left, to stop Axis, so Bright orders everyone to
rush inside the asteroid.

Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   As you enter Axis, you're greeted by several enemies, including Aura Bat-
tlers, machine beasts, Mikeene units, Barm and Demon Empire mechs, A-Class
heavy metals and Muge units. No one understands how can those enemies be the-
re, but Korosu (still wounded from the previous battle) explains the meganoid
technology was able to recreate them, once they gathered the necessary data.

   Don Zauser appears, at first surprised to see Korosu injured, but he un-
derstands what happened when he sees you. Judging you guilty of saddening and
hurting Korosu, he calls for your blood.

   The enemy startup line is very weak, which leaves you expecting for more.
on Turn 3, more comes: several beefy enemies, strategically places right bet-
ween you and Don Zauser.

   After Don Zauser is defeated, Amuro takes a breath, but Judou tells him
not the jump out yet - you still have to get out, fast. Banjou, however, is
still thinking about the meganoids...


Epilogue
--------

   Axis will probably go into an erratic orbit, and Sheila hopes it takes all
evil far away. Justice has won again, as usual, Kouji says, but Tetsuya tells
him this time they must learn. Rough times are still coming, as a torn Earth
Sphere must be rebuilt. Judou wonders what will be their punishment, but Bri-
ght says all responsibility lies on the captain (Bright himself) - Judou has
nothing to worry about. Still, Amuro's willing to take part of the responsi-
blity himself.

   "Universal Century 00XX. Hatred, idealism, ambition... after digesting all
of this, space is once again silent." Your people still chat while the cre-
dits roll.

   Kouji mentions they're back to a life of boredom, but Akira prefers peace
over anything. Sayaka agrees, and tells Bright she's glad they haven't been
punished for taking the Mazinger units, which reminds Bright that just the
other day the Union Parliament reached a decision.

   With this war and all its incidents, they fear Zeon terrorist acts happen
while the Londo Bell is out in reconaissance. For these events, the 'frozen'
machines were placed under 'national property care' and nothing wrong was do-
ne with the machines stationed at the ship.

   The Getter Team feels the Earth Union's trying to hide they've even parti-
cipated on this war, and make it look like even the lost lives never existed
in the first place... like it was all a dream. Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger and
Getter no longer risk being dismantled, and chances are they'll be placed un-
der direct control of the government, for use in troubled times like this.

   Judou wishes it takes at least three years before having to take part on
this again, so he decides to leave. Bright suggests joining the Jupitris II
fleet to Jupiter - this trip would take some four or five years - but Judou
doesn't feel like following Scirocco's steps. Besides, there's nothing there
he cares about - he'll only choose something he really wants to do.

   Camille thinks he'll go to Earth with Fa, for her surprise; he wants to
see what's on the bottom of the 'gravity well'. Kouji doesn't understand the
way space colony people often refer to gravity as a spirit-pulling shackle,
since he doesn't see any difference between people from either place. Camil-
le says if more people were like Kouji, Earth and space wouldn't have ended
up like this. Judou's amazed to listen Camille speaking well of anyone for a
change... Lina calls Judou to go, and Camille says he's taking off too.

   Later, it's Daba's turn to go; Amuro mentions the Muge Space linking Earth
to Pentagona is starting to shrink - he estimates it'll be totally closed in
32 hours. Amu regrets it's closing so quickly, after all the trouble they had
to become friends. Lacey just thanks everybody quickly, in an attempt to make
it less painful. Amuro, however, says the distance between them doesn't mean
they won't ever meet again - he's sure they will. Daba promises to seek a way
to return here after Pentagona's rebuilt - Amu suggests it could be for their
honeymoon.

   Amuro's left with the consciousness there are still several antagonisms on
Earth and the colonies, just like the ones that started this war - but humans
will grow over this. Daba leaves saying he won't forget those beautiful mechs,
white like L-Gaim, or those who piloted them.

   Cham's sad Lilith can't go visit her, but Shou tells her not to bother Da-
ba's group - what'll they do if they miss their route home? Amuro asks Shou
whether they're going home, and whether this is even possible. Shou explains
they might make it by gathering the auras of himself, Sheila and Marvel. Mar-
vel wonders if Shou should really abandon his home world again, but he's al-
ready decided - besides, he promised Todd.

   Shinobu says the war's over, and Sara criticizes him for sounding so sad,
while Masato and Ryou seize the opportunity to tick him a little further. Ka-
tsuya and Kyoshiro pop up to say thanks and goodbye, and Shinobu asks why's
the pretty girl so sad; by Richter's orders, Small Barm is driving away from
the Earth... Masato berates Shinobu's insensitivity, but Erica tells him not
to worry about it. She, by the way, is staying on Earth as part of a Barm de-
legation.

   Ryou's worried things may be a bit hard for Erica, given the state Earth's
left - he doesn't think it has resources enough to receive aliens. This time,
everybody falls on Ryou for making Erica feel so unwanted, and Shinobu's fast
to promise they'll protect her.

   Later, Quattro mentions Kou has already returned to the Oak Lee Base; Sea-
book and Cecily went back to Frontier IV. Amuro thinks about Seabook, and how
he's not involved with the government; Quattro answers Amuro himself was like
that once: Seabook's a newtype, and that grows over anything.

   Amuro asks if he's implying they're all going the same way. Quattro says
Amuro knows he has a new power. Speaking of new, Heero's bunch already left
to Preventer, but promising they'll defend the Earth Sphere whenever necessa-
ry.

   Quattro wonders if it's possible to unify the Earth Sphere; Amuro thinks
things'll be fine for as long as people like Quattro don't do anything hasty.
For now, he wants to spend more time with Lalah, but Chien suddenly appears,
saying she just heard Quattro's left the Londo Bell. He confirms it, and says
he's considering leaving the active duty as well.

   As Quattro's leaving, Amuro tells _Char_ he doesn't know whether they'll
be friends or foes the next time they meet. Chien says this can't be - after
fighting together, Quattro's now a friend... isn't he? The end game text goes
as follows:


   "Universal Century 00XX.

   Having all its record logs deleted, the Londo Bell was dissolved.

   And, with all these questions pending, the United Earth Sphere started.

   Here, this act of the warriors' battle ends. Coming up... the second act.

   But that's a different story..."




CHARACTER LISTING------------------------------------------------------------

   This section shows all pilots you can get, their types, as well as the le-
vels in which they start to move twice per turn and their personalities. Per-
sonalities affect the amount of kiryoku a character gathers or loses when an
allied unit is destroyed:


    Personality      |      Kiryoku gained/lost when a friend is defeated
   ------------------+----------------------------------------------------
    Super Strong     |                           + 2
      Strong         |                           + 1
      Regular        |                           + 0
       Weak          |                           - 1


   A character's personality is given by the game, and cannot be changed. The
information in this section was not found out by myself: I translated it from
a japanese webpage (http://www.bb.wakwak.com/~mrk/game/srwc/srwc.html).

HELP NEEDED------------------------------------------------------------------

   I will place in this section any doubts I might have about the game. Hope-
fully someone might be able to help me with them. More questions will be pos-
ted as they arise.


 - What are exactly the specs on the anti-beam stuff (Beam Coat, Aura Barrier
   and I-Field)? That is, how much damage can they take before breaking?

 - How much does the 'HP Restore' skills recover? Maybe it's me, but I'm ha-
   ving problems figuring it out.


CONTACT INFORMATION----------------------------------------------------------

   If anyone has questions, comments or suggestions to make, please feel free
to mail me at the address written on the beginning of this document. However,
before doing that, please pay attention to the following requests/facts:


  - Write "FAQ" as your subject, just so I can separate your mail from junk
    mail and things alike.

  - Due to the amount of mail I receive, I might not be able to respond all
    e-mails. So, if you receive no response, it doesn't mean it hasn't been
    received and/or read. Don't send it over and over.

  - I know the 'canonical' names for mechs and characters from all the Gun-
    dam series; I just happen not to agree with some of them. Do not ask me
    to change that. However, please DO let me know the *official* names for
    any series, especially non-Gundam ones.

  - Feel free to point grammar mistakes or anything like that. English is
    not my native language, and advice is always welcome.

  - Do not ask me where you can get "romz". If it's up to me, you won't get
    them; as a matter of fact, do not ask me ANYTHING about ROMs, emulators
    or patches, nor complain to me if you can't run it on your computer.

  - No 'l33t' language please. What can I say, I just hate it.



VERSION HISTORY--------------------------------------------------------------

 V 1.0  (08/29/2002) - Initial Release. All the non-walkthrough parts of it
                       are pretty much a rewrite of my Dai 4 Ji Super Robot
                       Taisen guide, so mistakes might have slipped.
