The Command Room contains briefing on the next mission.
The Hanger is where you prepare for the next mission.
The MS Garage is where you upgrade your units.
Save is where...You save. :P
Mission Start brings you to the next mission. If there are two options, the
second brings you to an Extra Stage rather than the next mission.

Tips
------------------------------------------------------------

Capturing:

Capturing allows you to take enemy units for yourself to pilot, sell, or take
apart. To capture a unit, make sure the following conditions are met:

1. The unit is not in a squad
2. You have atleast 3 of your units touching the enemy unit
3. A large amount of damage is done to the enemy

In order to raise your chances of successfully capturing an enemy unit, you
should:

1. Lower the unit's HP as much as possible without actually destroying it
2. Surround it with more units

Keep in mind that not all enemy units can be captured. This usually only
applies to units with actual pilots and not nameless, faceless grunts.
(There are, however, some exceptions.)

Communicating:

Communicating allows a character to talk to another during battle. This doesn't
just apply to allies - You can sometimes communicate with your enemies, too.
Communicating usually results in getting some bonus experience at the end of
the map, and should always be done when it's not too much trouble. In later G
Generation games, communicating ends a character's turn, but that isn't the
case for Gather Beat. You can communicate and attack all in the same turn, so
it's recommended that you do it when possible.

Extra Stages:

Extra Stages are completely optional, and usually require you to fulfill some
kind of condition to access them. To see if an Extra Stage is currently
available, go to the next mission option in the Intermission menu. Usually,
there will be one option. If an Extra Stage is available, a second option will
also be on the screen. The bottom option brings you to the Extra Stage.

IDs:

IDs are abilities that can be used by pilots to make them fight better. Some
restore HP, some strengthen attacks, and some make them dodge better. IDs
consume SP, which in some G Generation games is gradually restored over the
course of the battle, but it will not be replenished until the battle is over
in this one.

Squads:

Squads are groups of units that move and attack together. A squad can consist
of 2 units, or 3 units. In order to make a squad, you just move one of your
units on the map onto the same space that another is in.

Upgrading:

Upgrading your MS can be done during Intermissions, and is a key method of
increasing your battle strength.

Walkthrough
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
Stage 1
------------------------------------------------------------

Player Units:
Gundam (Amuro)

Player Reinforcements:
Guntank (Hayato)
Guncannon (Kai)
Core Fighter (Ryu)

Friendly Units:
White Base (Bright)

Enemy Units:
Zaku II F (Gene)
Zaku II F (Denim)
Zaku II F (Slender)
Leo (Machine Gun) (Shagia)
Leo (Machine Gun) (Olba)

Events:
-Amuro Communicates with Bright
-Amuro Communicates with Bright
Shagia or Olba is defeated:
-Shagia and Olba retreat
Enemy Turn 1:
-Gene, Denim, and Slender form a squad
Friendly Turn 1:
-Player Reinforcements arrive

On the first mission, we have a battle roughly based on the first episode of
Gundam. Gene, Denim, and Slender infiltrate Side 7 to check out the results of
the Federation's Project V Mobile Suits. However, Gene gets a little excited
and decides to blow 'em up! This is where Amuro, our hero, comes in. He hops
aboard the Gundam to fend off the enemies.

On Enemy Turn 1, Gene, Denim, and Slender will automatically form a squard, so
I recommend sending Amuro back a little bit and having him communicate with
Bright, who mentions something about IDs. (See the "Tips" section for more info
on IDs.) Note that Amuro has the ability to communicate with him twice. (See
the "Tips" section for more info on communicating, also.) If you want, use
Amuro's ID spell and end your turn.

When the Zakus attack, you'll probably want to evade, as 3 on 1 isn't the best
condition to be fighting under. But don't worry, your friends show up in more
Project V Mobile Suits to back you up before next turn. You may want to try
weakening their squad with long range fire from the Guntank and Guncannon,
while concentrating on attacking them with the Gundam and Core Fighter. They'll
go down in no time.

Just as you finish off the Zakus, Shagia and Olba should be getting close with
their Leos. Concentrate on one, since when one goes down, they both retreat.

------------------------------------------------------------
Intermission 1
------------------------------------------------------------

New Pilots:
Amuro
Bright
Hayato
Kai
Ryu
Sayla

New Units:
Core Fighter
Core Fighter
Guncannon
Gundam
Guntank
White Base

New Parts:
Bazooka

Units Available for Purchase:
Core Fighter - 150
Ball         - 98

Here, you have a choice. You can leave your Gundam as it is, or convert it into
a Hyper Bazooka using Gundam. The Hyper Bazooka has more power, but is less
accurate and has less ammo, whereas the Beam Rifle has less power, but is more
accurate and has more ammo. That said, it's really up to you which you keep.

Other than that, the only thing you'll need to do is put your pilots into the
White Base so you can actually use them for the next mission. You'll have Sayla
who was previously unavailable, so make sure to put her in one of your Core
Fighters if you'd like to use her.

------------------------------------------------------------
Stage 2
------------------------------------------------------------

Player Units:
White Base (Bright)
-5 Player Units

Friendly Units:
Salamis (Reed)

Friendly Reinforcements:
Flat (Loran)

Enemy Units:
Musai (Dren)
Char's Custom Zaku (Char)
Zaku II F (Bazooka) (Slender)
Zaku II F (Bazooka) (Kuraun)
Zaku II F x3

Events:
-Sayla attacks Char
-Amuro communicates with Char
-Sayla communicates with Char after attacking him
Kraun is defeated:
-Kraun gets caught by the Earth's gravity and is destroyed
Dren's Musai is damaged (25%~):
-Dren retreats
Char's Zaku is damaged (75%~):
-Char retreats
Friendly Turn 1:
-Friendly Reinforcements arrive and retreat
Player Turn 9:
-???

The name of the game this time is go to Earth! This explains why you can't move
the White Base - Char's attacking during re-entry. Since we're attempting to do
this, all units will be pulled closer to Earth at the start of every one of
your turns.

The distance between you and your enemy isn't too far, so don't worry about
them slipping past your units and attacking your ships. If they do, just pull
back your MS and destroy the enemies who made it through. More than likely,
this is exactly what Char will do - Go right by your MS to attack Reed's
Salamis.

On Friendly Turn 1, Loran from Turn A Gundam arrives in a Flat, but just goes
right past the battle to Earth. Thanks for the help, Loran.

By your second turn, all of the Zakus (Save Char's) will probably be destroyed
if you made your squads in a good way. Have Sayla attack Char, and you'll be
able to get some free hits in...As long as he doesn't evade them. It won't last
long, however, as he'll continue fighting back the next time he's attacked.
Have Amuro communicate with Char and he tells him his name. Sayla can
communicate with Char as well, but not until she's attacked him, first.

To get Char and Dren to retreat, you only need to damage them. Something will
happen if you don't finish all the enemies by Turn 9. Although exactly what it
is, I'm not sure. More then likely, you'll either automatically win or lose.
Don't worry about it though, really. It's hard not to win by turn 9. :P

------------------------------------------------------------
Intermission 2
------------------------------------------------------------

Units Available for Purchase:
Prototype GM - 200
Core Fighter - 150
Ball         - 98

Parts Available for Purchase:
Bazooka     - 150
Machine Gun - 100

If you'd like, you can take apart one of your Core Fighters and combine the G
Parts you get with the Gundam to make the Gundam (GF). This is a Gundam that
transforms into the G Armor. Although personally, I like to keep mine as just
a plain old Gundam for later.

You can purchase a Prototype GM so that one of your pilots isn't stuck in a
Core Fighter. That wouldn't hurt, either.

Notice Sayla's gone? We'll get to that next mission.

------------------------------------------------------------
Stage 3
------------------------------------------------------------

Player Units:
White Base (Bright)
-5 Player Units

Friendly Units:
Prototype GM (Sayla)

Friendly Reinforcements 1:
Medea (Matilda)
Core Fighter
-Core Fighter
Core Fighter
-Core Fighter

Friendly Reinforcements 2:
Gunperry (Alph Kamura)
GM Command (Yuu)
-GM Ground Type (Philip)
-GM Ground Type (Samana)

Enemy Units:
Gaw (Garma)
-Commander Type Zaku II F
Zaku II J (Doan)
Zaku II F x2
Zaku II F (Bazooka)
Dopp
-Dopp
Dopp x2
Magella Attack
-Dopp
Magella Attack x2

Enemy Reinforcements:
Char's Custom Zaku (Char)

Events:
-Amuro attacks Doan
-Sayla communicates with Char
-Player communicates with Alph
-Player communicates with Yuu
-Player communicates with Philip
-Player communicates with Samana
Sayla is damaged:
-Friendly Reinforcements 1 arrive
Char's Zaku is damaged (75%~):
-Char retreats
Garma's Gaw is damage (90%~):
-Garma is killed
Amuro communicates with Sayla:
-Sayla switches to Player side
Enemy Turn 2:
-Enemy Reinforcements arrive
Player Turn 3:
-Friendly Reinforcements 2 arrive



First thing in the mission, Sayla launches in a GM, and guess what? You can't
control her. This has disaster written all over it, huh? So here's what you do.
Send Amuro up, and on Turn 2, have him communicate with her, and you'll regain
control over her. You'll probably want to let her repair in White Base for a
turn before relaunching her.

When Matilda shows up, her Core Fighters will come in from the bottom of the
map and probably take out the two Magella Attacks down there, so you probably
shouldn't concentrate on them. Yuu will come and help you blow up some enemies,
too, and by the time all these Friendly units show up, the odds should be
looking up.

Go on destroying units and have Sayla communicate with Char if you want, but
be careful as she may get destroyed easily. You can communicate with the Blue
Destiny boys with any unit you want.

Bring Garma's health down to around 10% and he'll attempt to ram the Gaw into
White Base, dying in the process.

------------------------------------------------------------
Intermission 3
------------------------------------------------------------

New Pilots:
Alph Kamura
Philip
Samana
Yuu

New Units:
GM Command
GM Ground Type x2
Gunperry
Prototype GM

Units Available for Purchase:
GM           - 285
Core Booster - 255
Prototype GM - 200
Core Fighter - 150
Ball         - 98

Parts Available for Purchase:
Caterpillar Unit - 100
Bazooka          - 150
Beam Spray Gun   - 100
Machine Gun      - 100

I'm sure you're happy to have some new units on your team, as it's not easy to
fight with such a small number. You should consider buying two GMs to replace
your Prototype GMs, and other than that, there's not much to say.

Extra Stage 1 can be played before Stage 4, assuming you fulfilled the
requirements, if there even were any. When you go to Mission Start, it will be
the second option.

------------------------------------------------------------
Extra Stage 1
------------------------------------------------------------

Player Units:
White Base (Bright)
-5 Player Units
Gunperry (Alph)
-3 Player Units

Enemy Units:
Zaku II F (Bazooka)
Commander Type Zaku II J
-Zaku II F

-Zaku II F
Zaku II J (Bazooka)
-Zaku II F
Dopp
-Dopp
Magella Attack x2

Enemy Reinforcements 2:
Efreet Custom (Nimbus)
-Zaku II F (Bazooka)
-Zaku II F

Events:
???:
-Enemy Reinforcements 1 arrive
Approach Enemy Base:
-Enemy Reinforcements 2 arrive

This stage looks like some easy experience from the get-go, eh? Send in your
units to take out as many of the enemies as possible. Enemy Reinforcements show
up from the base up top either when you destroy enough units or at the end of
Enemy Turn 1 - I'm not sure which, but it's not super important.

Once you get close to the base, Nimbus shows up in his Efreet Custom. You know
what this means - Send in Yuu! Once Nimbus is attacked (By anyone), Yuu hears
the EXAM system. Attack Nimbus with Yuu, and there'll be a short discussion.

I'll tell you straight up. Nimbus is crazy. Your best bet is to defend against
any attacks he throws at you, while attempting to split his squad up with long
range attacks from your Guncannon, Guntank, White Base, and Gunperry. Once
that's done, focus on him with a squad or two of three.

------------------------------------------------------------
Intermission Extra 1
------------------------------------------------------------

Units Available for Purchase:
GM           - 285
Core Booster - 255
Prototype GM - 200
Core Fighter - 150
Ball         - 98

Parts Available for Purchase:
Caterpillar Unit - 100
Bazooka          - 150
Beam Spray Gun   - 100
Machine Gun      - 100

Nothing new here since the last intermission. Your pilots should be leveled up
a little bit more for the next mission after Extra Stage 1.

------------------------------------------------------------
Stage 4
------------------------------------------------------------

Player Units:
White Base (Bright)
-5 Player Units
Gunperry (Alph)
-3 Player Units

Enemy Units:
Zanzibar (Hamon)
Prototype Gouf (Ramba Ral)
-Zaku II J (Akosu)
-Zaku II J (Kozun)
Zaku II J (Klamp)
Zaku II F (Bazooka) x4

Events:
-Ryu communicates with Amuro
-Amuro attacks Ramba Ral (Not sure)
-Sayla attacks Ramba Ral
Hamon's Zanzibar is damage (50%~):
-Hamon retreats

Amuro got a new picture. :D (I actually like the first one better, but this
one's still cool.)

Start by moving your team up. The Zakus aren't very hard, but Ramba can be, so
be careful around him. He's seriously all you need to watch out for, though.
Split his squad and take him out and the only threat is gone. Chances are he'll
go down before the Zanzibar, but you only need to get that down to about 50% HP
anyway. Once Hamon retreats, Cima shows up and talks with Ramba a bit, and
that's it. Map clear.

------------------------------------------------------------
Intermission 4
------------------------------------------------------------

Units Available for Purchase:
GM Ground Type - 350
GM             - 285

Clearance Parts  - 350
Bazooka          - 150
Beam Spray Gun   - 100
Machine Gun      - 100

Now that you can buy GM Ground Types and Clearance Parts, you have the ability
to upgrade your units much more than before. GM Ground Types are good as it is,
but combine them with some Clearance Parts and you can make a Gundam Ground
Type, and you know that wouldn't hurt. But, if you don't really need it, then
I recommend saving your money until you do so you can buy more and better
stuff.

Zaku II S
Zaku II J x2


Events:
Amuro and the Black Tristars fight:
-Amuro's HP is greatly reduced
-Matilda and Mash are killed
Enemy Turn 1:
-Enemy Reinforcements 1 arrive
Player Turn 2:
-Player Reinforcements arrive
???:
-All enemies retreat
-Enemy Reinforcements 2 arrive
Shiro communicates with Aina after attacking her:
-Aina retreats

Hey, it's Jaburo, a pretty cool battle usually. Well, you know the drill.
Start by sending your units out ahead. The Black Tristars show up fairly early,
but so does the 08th MS Team. Hooray for more units, right? :D

You shouldn't run into any problems early on - Just keep blowing up enemies. If
Amuro attacks the Black Tristars or the other way around, they'll pull a Jet
Stream Attack on him and reduce his HP to very, very low numbers. In comes
Matilda, and being the little hero she has to be, she gets shot. So Amuro gets
mad and does a nice 9999 damage to Mash...Yeah, overkill.

Now, your problem is Amuro's sitting in front of the two remaining Black
Tristars with almost no HP, but don't worry. As soon as he's attacked, he'll
automatically get all of his HP back.

Keep fighting and all the enemies will retreat. I'm not entirely sure how you
trigger this event. It happened for me when I blew up one of M'quve's Zakus,
but it might happen when you destroy a certain amount of units. Problem is,
more enemies show up. Big ones.

They're hard, but not if you concentrate on one at a time. After Shiro attacks
Aina once, he can communicate with her, and afterwards, she'll retreat. Saves
you a fight with an Apsalus III, right? (It probably also leads to getting Aina
later on - I can't be entirely sure, though.)

Done with Jaburo, and the White Base and Gundam have gotten a little upgrade.
The White Base has been replaced with the Grey Phantom, and the Gundam replaced
with the MC Gundam. Nothing too big, but it will help.

You should probably upgrade one of your Gundam Ground Types to the Blue
Destiny-I with your new EXAM parts.

Events:
-Amuro communicates with Zero
Shagia or Olba's Gundam is damaged (40%~):
-Shagia and Olba retreat

It's Zero! :D Start by moving your units forward. Concentrate on Shagia or
Olba, but not  both of them, as weakening one will 'cause them both to run
off. That's about it for this mission. Without Shagia or Olba around, it's
little more than target practice on some Zakus.

Zero will join you afterwards, but it's possible he will only do it if you had
Amuro communicate with him, I don't know. Make sure you do that just to be
safe.

-Gato retreats
Player Turn 2:
-Player Reinforcements arrive
-Friendly Reinforcements arrive
Enemy Turn 2:
-Enemy Reinforcements arrive

I'm sure you're familiar with what's going on here - Your run of the mill
Gundam Jack.

Just incase you aren't aware, he has a nuke. Watch out for that. My advice is to
attack with Kou on your first turn, and by the second some of your regular units
should be able to reach him, so lay it on thick and don't let him escape since
that's obviously his goal. (Maybe try taking him out with Kou just incase.) He
should be down by atleast Turn 3.

After Gato's out of the way, you won't have much difficulty clearing away most
of the enemies - Even the reinforcements that showed up on Turn 2. You can
communicate with Monsha twice this mission. Once with Chris, and once with
either Kou or anybody, I'm not entirely sure.

Take out Bernie with Chris. I'm uncertain whether or not it affects you getting
him, but do it just to be safe. (He won't show up until after Stage 7, so don't
worry if he's not there after this one.)

You've got the Albion now, which means 4 more units per mission. Also, you've
got access to some good units, now. You can buy GM Snipers and Sensors, which
you can combine into GM Sniper IIs. You can also buy Gundarium Alpha, which
will upgrade your Gundam Ground Types into Gundams. If you need more Gundam
Ground Types, buy GM Ground Types and combine them with Clearance Parts.

Events:
-Camille fights Franklin

Enemy Turn 1:
-Enemy Reinforcements arrive
Player Turn 2:
-Player Reinforcements 1 arrive
Player Turn 3:
-Player Reinforcements 2 arrive
Enemy Turn 3:
-Steiner, Misha, and Garcia are killed
Enemy Turn 12:
-???

The enemy's quite far on this map, so I'd keep your units in your ships until
atleast turn 2, but it's your choice. Gato shows up on Enemy Turn 1, and
Camille shows up on Player Turn 2 to fight his dad, Franklin. It's probably a
good idea to send two of your units out to form a squad with Camille to help
him out, while sending the rest of your team over the mountains to fight the
rest of the enemies.

At the beginning of Turn 3, Domon and Master Asia show up to help out. Once the
enemy's turn comes, the Cyclops Team will try to what looks like kamikaze into
the Grey Phantom, getting killed in the process. The shuttle seems to be
counting down to something every turn, probably until they can escape with the
GP02. Still, 12 turns is just tons of time to get the job done, so don't feel
pressured or anything, this isn't even a very hard level.

After everybody's destroyed, Killing tries to escape in a Zanzibar, but Heero
has other plans. Sadly, he doesn't stay.

There's not much to say here, except Camille's a pretty good pilot, and on top
of it he's a Newtype, so he'll be a nice addition to the team. Domon's not bad
either, and the Shining Gundam is pretty powerful.

Player Turn 5:
-Explosions go off
Player Turn 6:
-Explosions go off
Player Turn 7:
-Explosions go off
Player Turn 8:
-Explosions go off

Looks like Ramba's back for some more, huh? This time, in his own Custom Dom.
Move your ships up the field, but you'll probably want to keep your units in
them until turn 2 as there should still be quite a distance between the enemy
and you. If you move the Gunperry straight ahead, it'll be attacked by a Gouf,
but that's nothing you can't hold off for a turn.

On turn 2, the fighting should begin. Sayla can communicate with Ramba Ral
three, yes, three times for some reason, and Amuro can once, and then once with
Hamon. There's nothing else really important to note here. Be careful around
Ramba, make good use of your ranged attacks, and you'll be fine.

On turn 5, M'quve says something, and a lot of explosions start going off at
the bottom of the map. The explosions will continue every turn - Your goal now
is to retreat. In order to do this, put your units at the very top of the map.
To clear the map, you must do one of the following, although which one you need
to do is unclear. The explosions will probably go off until you retreat.

1. Have the Grey Phantom retreat
2. Have all of your ships retreat

And that's all. Pretty easy mission, right?

-M'quve retreats
Enemy Turn 1:
-Enemy Reinforcements arrive
Enemy Turn 5:
-Aina switches to Friendly side
-Enemy Reinforcements 2 arrive

Start by moving up your ships and deploying your units. The remaining Black
Tristars, Gaia and Ortega, will arrive right after you finish, seeking to avenge
Mash...Again.

Watch out for Aina and the other Apsalus units. The Gyan has some decent melee
damage, but the HP is rather low, so it shouldn't cause much trouble.

Don't hurt Aina too much, she becomes an Ally on Enemy Turn 5. The game will
automatically target a building in the top left corner - It's possible that you
will win the mission if you reach it. Or, just blow up all enemies before turn
12 rolls around.

Shagia or Olba's Gundam is damaged (50%~):
-Shagia and Olba retreat
M'quve's Gyan is damaged (100%):
-M'quve will retreat
Enemy Turn 1:
-Usso steals the Kampfer and switches to Friendly side

Those freakin' Frost brothers are back again. Head in with your strongest units
heading to the bottom right, because they'll be taking on M'quve and the Frosts.
On the enemy's first turn, Usso steals the Kampfer. (What else would you expect
from Usso? :P) Have Bright communicate with him, and he switches to your side.

Just like always, the Frost brothers run away when the going gets tough, so
only concentrate on one of them. Once M'quve's damaged, he runs as well.

The stage is actually really easy. All of the grunts have the same units you've
been fighting for a while, and the actual character pilots aren't very hard,
either. The stage shouldn't give you much trouble at all.

Looks like Gineas has finally decided to show his face on the battlefield. The
Frost brothers are here too...Guess what they'll do when they take a bit of
damage?

The Argama and Albion can't move, only the Grey Phantom. You might as well keep
it where it is and just send out your units, though. After you finish your turn,
Corin, Jacop, and Bruno show up.

On Enemy Turn 2, Yuri shows up in a Gaw in an attempt to stop Gineas, but is
killed.

On Enemy Turn 4, Gineas blows up Aina's Apsalus III. (This guy's outta control.)

On Player Turn 5, Aina shows up in a Gelgoog JG, now on your side.

Now that you have access to the Thruster Unit, you can upgrade your units even

Start the usual way by sending your ships out and then your MS. The enemy will
reach you by their first turn. The Frost brothers will retreat when you weaken
them enough, but they'll retreat separately this time.

After 7 enemies are destroyed, the remaining original enemy units retreat and
reinforcements come. Then, on Enemy Turn 4, Char, Apolly, and Roberto arrive.

Make sure you have Sayla communicate with Char on Turn 1 because he won't be
sticking around after it's over. When Turn 2 comes, make her communicate with
Amuro so that he rejoins your side.

On the enemy's second turn, you've gotta deal with some Musais and 6 Rick Doms
showing up near the bottom right of the map.

Since Char and Lalah retreat without getting more than 1 attack in each, your
biggest threat is probably Apolly and Roberto. Amuro and Sayla are pretty
vulnerable, so try to keep them covered as best you can throughout the mission.
Keep your ships away from the bottom right corner because the reinforcements
will just gang up on them if you don't. Once all enemies are defeated, the
map will be cleared.

The Re-GZ is a pretty good unit, it'll make a nice addition. Know what else
would? Some of those Gundam mkIIs that are for sale! If you've got the money
and think you might need some, don't hesitate.

-Enemy Reinforcements 1 arrive
Enemy Turn 4:
-Enemy Reinforcements 2 arrive

I'm sure you see those round things all over the ground, right? Those are mines,
and if you step on them, rest assured, they will blow up. It's not too much
damage, but don't go putting units on them unless it's worth it. (Mines will
do 300 damage.)

Please note you cannot go over a field of mines, you must go around them.

Bring your ships in through the paths that are cleared. (Why didn't M'quve just
put mines on ALL the tiles? :P) The enemies actually won't even move, but they
will counterattack. Damage the Zanzibar near M'quve and a whoooole bunch of
Gelgoogs surround you. What a surprise. M'quve took the steps to set yet
another trap. These ones are different from the original enemies, however,
because they actually will attack.

On Enemy Turn 4, the second batch of reinforcements arrive. This time, Char,
Apolly, Roberto, Marigan, and Haman in her Elmeth. Char's actually somewhat
dangerous when in a squad with Apolly and Roberto, so attempt to split their
squad up. Defeat Char or Haman and the second group of reinforcements retreat.
If there are still enemies left afterwards, destroy them all to proceed to
clear the map.

This mission is insanely easy. You'll probably be done by the 3rd or 4th turn.
Every enemy you fight, save Zabine, is a pretty weak grunt. On top of that,
you've got 6 GM Sniper IIs helping you take these guys out. All I've got to
recommend is having Amuro communicate with Birgit and Seabook for some easy
experience.

Kyoji is damaged (90%~):
-Kyoji retreats
Rain is damaged (90%~):
-Rain retreats
Player Turn 3:
-Friendly Reinforcements arrive

Make sure Domon communicates with Rain or Kyoji as soon as possible because
chances are, she'll dive headfirst into a group of enemies and get taken out
right away, and by no means do you wanna miss out on some easy event EXP,
right? I say Rain or Kyoji because it's one or the other. Once you have Domon
communicate with one, he can't communicate with the other.

Once Domon encounters an enemy, he gains his Shining Finger ID, which works
the same as a regular attack, except he is the only one in his group who will
act during the battle. (This Makes Domon pretty decent if he's not in a squad.
Use his Attack +60% ID first, and you'll be scoring really big damage...)

Use Domon's ID combination to easily take out either Alex or Muller, then team
up on the other with strong units. From there, all you've got to deal with are
Leos and Taurus - Nothing big at all.

-Heero switches to player side
10 Enemy Reinforcements destroyed:
-Enemy Reinforcements 2 arrive
Apsalus II is damaged (90%?):
-Friendly Reinforcements arrive

Wing Gundam is very powerful in this game. Don't worry about fighting it,
though, because Heero will join you almost right away. If he attacked one of
your squads, be careful about moving them up too far or they might get killed.

If you take out 10 of the Enemy Reinforcements, Enemy Reinforcements 2 come.
It's just one Apsalus II, and it's not like you haven't been fighting these
for a while, so if anything it's only somewhat of a shock storywise. (Not if
you're not new to G Generation games, anyway. Zeon and OZ are always helping
each other out.)

After the Apsalus II that just showed up is damaged (I'm not sure how much.
I took about 90% of its health out with my first attack on it, but maybe all
it takes is one attack.) Zechs and Noin arrive as Friendly units. Heero can't
communicate with them, surprisingly. They're actually not very useful because
the enemy will be practically whiped out by the time they get there, but, help
is always welcome, I suppose. Finish off the rest of the enemies to clear the
map.

After the last mission, Shiro spoke to Nina about upgrading his Ez-8 a second
time. So now, you have the choice to upgrade it into the Ez-8 Heavy Arms Custom
or Ez-8 High Mobility Custom. It's entirely up to you, but personally, I prefer
the High Mobility Custom.

Yuu won't be in your pilot roster for this intermission, so make sure you give
him a replacement.

Yuu's out testing the Blue Destiny-III Kai (I know, I know. A unit like that
needs an upgrade? XD) when all of the sudden, Nimbus shows up and activates
the EXAM System. Your guys show up to help Yuu out, but are cut off by a wall
of enemies. You know what to do, activate EXAM and go kick his butt.

Aside from Nimbus, nothing should be much of a challenge. You'll probably be
done by the time your third time rolls around. If Yuu is low on health, don't
attack Nimbus. Let him attack you, counter, then finish him with your next
attack so that you go before him and don't have to worry about him hitting you
before you get your attack in.

You'll lose the Blue Destiny-III permanently after this mission.

Turn A units are kinda tough. SUMOs have I-Fields, so make sure you hit them
with non-beam weapons or melee attacks. After Turn 1, Bright can communicate
with Harry. Once this happens, only Corin's squad will keep fighting you. Of
course, you can kill off more of them if you want more experience, but it's
not necessary.

When Bright communicated with Harry, a square should've flashed on a building.
You need to move the Argama here to continue with the stage. After you reach
it, you're ambushed by a bunch of OZ MS. Make sure you use melee attacks on
the Virgos, and watch your HP because your units may be fairly worn out after
fighting the Turn A units. To finish the map, destroy all enemies.

You can't buy any new units, but the Argama has been replaced by the Nahel
Argama and you've got some new parts. (Nice ones, too.) Go make yourself a
few monsters units. (Zetaaaa.)

Enemy Reinforcements:

Events:
-Amuro destroys the Big Zam
-Bright communicates with Wakkein
-Chris communicates with Monsha
-Kou communicates with Monsha
-Kou fights Gato
Sleggar fights the Big Zam:
-Sleggar is killed
-Big Zam is brought down to 100 HP
Kycilia is damaged:
-Kycilia's Gwazine is destroyed
-Cima retreats
8 Enemy Units are destroyed:
-Dozle retreats
-Enemy Reinforcements arrive
Player Turn 2:
-A cutscene occurs where the Federation fights OZ

If you'd like, have your units communicate with some of the others on your
first turn and send in the rest to start the action. On the beginning of your
second turn, a short cutscene occurs.

Be careful of the Neue Ziel, it can be dangerous if you don't pay attention.
If you damage Kycilia's Gwazine, one of her men says something about the main
engine, then their ship blows up. Afterwards, Cima is seen fleeing in the
Gerbera Tetra. (Cima did it, I guess?)

Destroy 8 units, and Dozle's Gwazine will retreat, followed by the launch of
the Big Zam. If you attack the Big Zam with Sleggar, he'll be killed off
permanently, but make the fight against the Big Zam insanely easy, as he'll
bring it down to 100 HP by sacrificing himself.

Once all of the enemies are destroyed, a short conversation between Cima and
the Frost brothers will take place. Guess they're plotting something, huh?

Lots and lots of enemies here, eh? The Frost brothers are in their upgraded
Gundams, and even the freakin' Libra's here...

So many annoying Virgos with their Planet Defensors on this mission. Make sure
you're using your melee attacks against them to get around that. Shagia and
Olba can be pretty dangerous when they use IDs, try to take them out fast.
(Shining Fingaaaaa!! Er, what I'm trying to say is, Shining Finger is handy.
You only need to take out a bit over half of their HP to make them retreat.)

On your 3rd turn, Heero shows up to help you out. (Thank God, eh?) Stay alert
with the Virgos, even after all the main characters are gone. They'll more
than likely all concentrate on your weakest squad. After you take them all
out, focus on the Libra and Peacemillion, which should go down rather easily,
especially compared to all the units you just fought.

Events:
-Kou fights Gato
All enemies are destroyed:
-Enemy Reinforcements arrive
???:
-Gromlin loses its ability to regenerate

The first wave of enemies aren't too bad, to be honest. Be careful around
Gato and watch out for enemies ganging up on you. Once all enemies are
destroyed (Or maybe just Giren?) the reinforcements arrive.

Go all out. If you've got SP left, use your ID spells and don't hold back.
But don't try it on the Gromlin - It will just keep regenerating its HP. Also,
the Gromlin is able to attack twice per turn.

On the unknown condition: It may be based on how long the Gromlin has been
around. For me, it lost its regeneration ability on Enemy Turn 6. However, it
also happened for me once I destroyed all the other units. (This is probably
how you get the even to trigger.)

Anyway, once the event does happen, attack it with everything you've got. It
shouldn't give you too much trouble and the only reason it's so hard is the
9999 HP, basically.

Once the Gromlin goes down...Enjoy the Credits.

Lots of new available parts that were previously only available by capturing
and disassembling units are not for sale in the shop.

What else?

By going to the Next Mission screen, you can now select a map from a list and
play there. You'll find a nice assortment of Mobile Suits seen throughout the
game. This is handy for acquiring new units, parts, and levelling up your
pilots.

You've also got access to Special Mode on the main menu. Special Mode is
basically just a more challenging version of the game.

And with this, I'd like to congratulate you on beating the game, see you in
Gather Beat 2!

Special thanks to:

Yoshiyuki Tomino-For creating Gundam.
Bandai-For creating this game.
GameFAQs-For being the wonderful site it is and because without it, there'd
be a lot more unbeaten games in my collection. XD
RPGZero-I think subconsciously, the layout of his G Generation guides is what
affected the layout of mine the most. (Atleast, the mission part anyway.)
