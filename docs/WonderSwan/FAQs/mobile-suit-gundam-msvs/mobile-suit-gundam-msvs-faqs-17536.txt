Section 1: Overview
--------------------

    All Universal Century fans know their names.  The MS-05 Zaku and the RGM-
79 GM.  A pair of mass produced mobile suits that spawned an array of 
variants.

    Even though the focus of attention in mobile suit design from UC 0079-
0083 was the Gundam and its successors, the bulk of mobile suits produced in 
this period were much more humble.  Though they get little screen time, they 
are in fact more important to the history of the Universal Century than the 
Gundam itself.

    What would it be like to a test pilot during those years?  Can you help 
Anaheim Electronics research Federation and Zeon mobile suits, leading up to 
the final fruits of the Gundam Development Project?

    In MSVS, you assume the role of a test pilot for Anaheim Electronics.  
Replay the famous battles of the war, from the first incursion of Denim's 
Zaku II in Side 7 all the way to a climactic showdown against Anavel Gato and 
the RX-78GP02a Physalis.  Test out a wide variety of mobile suit variations, 
from the simple and well-known MS-05 Zaku I to the obscure RAG-79-G1 
Gundiver.  Can you master the mobile suits of the Universal Century?

---------------------------
Section 2: Version History
---------------------------

    0.8 (6/23/02): First draft.  Contains all currently known unlockable 
friendly mecha from the MSVS basic version.

-------------------------------------
Section 3: General Mecha Information
-------------------------------------

    In MSVS, you are given 5 different slots for keeping mecha.  In order to 
view your current mecha, change weapons, upgrade, change models, purchase new 
and sell old mecha, go to the MS Deck.  (Option 3)  All MS transactions occur 
in 'Dock Points', which represent your credit and standing with Anaheim 
Electronics.

    The MS Deck has 5 different selections.  They are, in order:

    Setup - change and check the equipment of your mecha
    Custom - upgrade the statistics of your mecha
    Model Change - unlock new models and alter existing models
    New Unit - construct a brand new unit
    Dispose (Shobun) - sell off your old units

    When you start the game, Anaheim Electronics will have 3 mecha in its 
possession: a MS-06F Zaku II, a RX-75 Guntank, and a MS-06M Zaku Marine Type.  
You can dispose of these as you please, but I'd recommend keeping the Zaku II 
(unless you plan on selling everything and buying a RGM-79 GM).  If you do 
sell everything, when coupled with the 2600 Dock Points you begin with, 
you'll have a grand total of 4900 Dock Points.  That is enough to buy a new 
RGM-79 and give it 9 upgrades.  (Or you can upgrade the Zaku II completely if 
you sell the Guntank and Zaku Marine Type, leaving you with 400 Dock Points.)

    All mecha have certain vital statistics.  If you enter the Custom screen 
and select a mecha (either by pressing down or A), they are in order:

    Taikyuuryoku (Physical Strength)
    Soukou Atai (Armor Value)
    Undousei (Mobility)
    Sakuteki Nouryoku (Enemy Detection Ability)
    Generator
    Tekisei (Aptitude) for the 4 Terrain Types
    Size

    And what are their uses?

Taikyuuryoku:  This is displayed as your HP.  When this reaches zero, your 
suit has been destroyed.

Soukou Atai: This value helps reduce the damage suffered from enemy attacks.

Undousei: This not only determines how quickly and nimbly your unit moves on 
the map, but it also increases your chance of evading enemy attacks.

Sakuteki Nouryoku: This determines the maximum distance at which your unit 
can lock onto enemy units.  During Storm conditions, this value is lowered to 
approximately 75% of the maximum.

Generator: This is displayed as your EN.  When this value reaches zero, your 
mobility will be lowered, but you can still move.  Certain attacks (usually 
physical attacks, some beam weapons without E Caps) require EN to use.  If 
you have 0 EN, you can still use these attacks, but they will be at 
approximately 50% effectiveness (they seem to miss more, and they will do 50% 
damage).

Tekisei: This determines how well this mobile suit, in general, performs in 
one of 4 different terrain types.  They are Uchuu (Space), Chijou (Ground), 
Sabaku (Desert), and Mizuchuu (Underwater).  If a unit has a D Aptitude in a 
terrain, it can neither be deployed in that terrain nor can its aptitude be 
upgraded in that terrain.

Size: This cannot be changed.  Smaller units seem to have a bonus to their 
evasion.

    All mecha can have 10 sets of upgrades applied in total, and 4 in any one 
category.  The cost of upgrading statistics is fixed, based on the unit.  
Aptitude upgrades cost much more.  If you change the model of a mobile suit, 
the upgrades used will be reset to 0 (but you'll get the base statistics).

    Certain mecha can be changed from one model to another.  This is a non-
reversible action.  For most of the MS variants, you will have to construct 
the new model via a model change before it appears on the New Unit 
construction menus and is available as a unit for the enemy to pilot during 
Single actions.

    And now, weapons.  Mecha weapons (including armor and shields) are viewed 
in the Set Up screen.  All weapons and armor fall into 7 different location 
categories: Kotei (fixed), Migite (right hand), Hidarite (left hand), Ryoute 
(Both Hands), Ude (Arm), Kata (Shoulder), Senaka (Back), Ashi (Legs), Koshi 
(Hips), Shatai (Frame), and Body.  Kotei (fixed) weapons cannot be removed or 
replaced.  For all the others, you may have 1 weapon in each slot.  (That is, 
you can only choose 1 weapon from all systems that are of the Migite type to 
hold in your right hand; and the same for your Hidarite, Ryoute, Ude, Kata, 
Senaka, Ashi, Koshi, Shatai, and Body systems.)  In the case of Shields, 
special Boosters, and Layered Armor (e.g., the RX-78NT1 Alex's Chobham 
Armor), you can usually select between using the armor/shield and leaving it 
off.  These are marked with a  *, since they can be on, or you may select 
"Soubi Nashi" (equip nothing).  Armors and shields increase the Armor of the 
unit in general, but reduce its mobility.  Shields also can occasionally be 
used by the pilot to completely absorb an incoming attack.

    All weapons systems have several characteristics.  Their location (as 
covered above), their AP (attack points), range, hit rates, and ammunition or 
energy.  The AP is listed as AxB, where A is the amount of damage each shot 
will do when it impacts, and the B indicates the number of shots in each 
salvo.  For example, the MS-06F Zaku II has a 120mm Machinegun is listed as 
15x3.  This means each attack consists of a burst of 3 shots, each 
potentially doing 15 points of damage (for a total of 45 if all 3 hit).

    The range is just that; the range at which the weapon can be fired.  
After the numerical range, up to 3 letters are listed: S, M, and L.  This 
indicates which of the three general attack ranges that weapon falls under 
for this unit.  Note that what constitutes the 'Short', 'Middle', and 'Long' 
range varies from mobile suit to mobile suit.

    The hit rate is a rough guide of how accurate the weapon is.  Finally, 
all weapons either use ammunition or energy.  For weapons with ammunition, 
the displayed value is the number of salvoes this weapon has (not individual 
shots).  Again, a MS-06F Zaku II's 120mm Machinegun has a listed ammunition 
of 50; that means it has a total of 150 rounds (3x50).  If a weapon has 
energy listed, instead, it uses energy when it is fired/executed.  As noted 
above, weapons that use energy work at reduced effectiveness if the mobile 
suit is out of energy, but they can still be fired.

--------------------------------
Section 4: Federal Forces Mecha
--------------------------------

    Federal Forces mobile suits (since they do not have any mobile armors) 
are divided into six main categories (and a hidden, 7th category that will 
not appear until you have completed Mission EX3 once).  These are built 
around the main archetypes of the mobile suit forces:

    RB-79: Space Support Weapons
    RX-75: Mobile Artillery
    RX-77: Medium Range Fire Support (including RGC mass produced units)
    RX-78: General Purpose High Grade Mobile Suit (full versions)
    RGM-79: General Purpose Mass Produced Mobile Suit (and RX-79 mass 
      produced Gundam types)
    RAG-79: Underwater Mobile Suit

    Of these, the strongest units (until you unlock the RX-78GP types) will 
be in the RX-78 family, and the most common military types lie in the RGM-79 
family.

    As you can see, one of the major strengths in the Federal Forces approach 
to mobile suit design and deployment is interchangeability.  Most mobile 
suits (with the exception of the RB-79 and RX-75 family) were constructed in 
generally the same design (humanoid, 2 legs, the basic RX-78 Gundam 'look', 
if you will).  The Federal Forces were able to deploy a massive number of 
mobile suits in a relatively limited amount of time once the finalization of 
the RGM-79 series was complete.

    For information on the RX-78GP family of mobile suits and the Gundam 
Development Project, please refer to Section 6.

   *********************
    Part A: RB-79 Types
   *********************

RB-79 "Ball"
Physical Strength: 250, +62
Armor Value: 16, +4
Mobility: 30, +7
Enemy Detection Ability: 40, +4
Generator: 175, +43
Aptitude: A/D/D/D
Size: S
Cost: 800, 200, N/A

Weapons:
120mm Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 30x1
Range: 16-60, ML
Hit: 40  Ammo: 50

Arm (Fixed)
AP: 16x1
Range: 0-15, S
Hit: 50  Energy: 3

Comments: The standard RB-79 Ball served as the only Federal Forces space-
capable mobile weapon during the opening stages of the One Year War.  While 
it is a decently capable space support weapon, it lacks all the qualities of 
a mobile suit - good armor, good mobility, and good weaponry.  The RB-79 Ball 
first appeared during Kidou Senshi Gundam.

RB-79K "Ball Custom"
Physical Strength: 260, +75
Armor Value: 18, +4
Mobility: 30, +7
Enemy Detection Ability: 40, +4
Generator: 175, +43
Aptitude: A/D/D/D
Size: S
Cost: 950, 237, N/A

Weapons:
180mm Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 20x2
Range: 16-60, ML
Hit: 40  Ammo: 50

Arm (Fixed)
AP: 16x1
Range: 0-15, S
Hit: 50  Energy: 3

Comments: Even though the Federal Forces eventually committed themselves to a 
true mobile suit development program, some Ball variants did appear during 
the One Year War.  By replacing the single 120mm Cannon mounted on the top of 
the Ball with a pair of twin 180mm Cannon, the damage potential has been 
increased on this model.  Several other minor improvements were also made to 
this version.  Shou-i Shiro Amada scored an impressive victory in space by 
using a RB-79K against Aina Sahalin in a MS-06RD-4, thus saving the life of 
Terry Sanders Jr.  The RB-79K Ball Custom first appeared during the Kidou 
Senshi Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai OAV series.

   *********************
    Part B: RX-75 Types
   *********************

RX-75 "Guntank"
Physical Strength: 300, +75
Armor Value: 24, +4
Mobility: 40, +10
Enemy Detection Ability: 60, +4
Generator: 300, +75
Aptitude: C/A/B/D
Size: LL
Cost: 1700, 425, 1700

Weapons:
120mm Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 60x1
Range: 41-85, L
Hit: 40  Ammo: 20

40mm Gun Launcher (Fixed)
AP: 10x4
Range: 16-30, SM
Hit: 45  Ammo: 30

Comments: One of three different designs proposed by Tem Rey to fulfill the 
Project V specifications for new Federal Forces mobile suits, the RX-75 (the 
original Guntank that survived on the White Base was the RX-75-4) trades 
mobility and close-combat ability for long range artillery support.  Despite 
its imposing countenance, the armor on this unit is rather weak, and it 
cannot engage targets at close range.  This version, with the Gun Launcher 
instead of Missile Tubes, reflects the first mass produced version available, 
and was deployed in the Southeast Asia region in support of the assault on a 
major Zeon base in the area.  The RX-75 Guntank first appeared during Kidou 
Senshi Gundam; however, this mass produced version first appears during Kidou 
Senshi Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai.

RMV-1 "Guntank II"
Physical Strength: 300, +75
Armor Value: 25, +4
Mobility: 40, +10
Enemy Detection Ability: 64, +4
Generator: 300, +75
Aptitude: D/A/B/D
Size: LL
Cost: 1500, 375, 1500

Weapons:
120mm Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 60x1
Range: 50-85, L
Hit: 40  Ammo: 20

Missile Launcher (Fixed) 
AP: 15x3
Range: 31-50, ML
Hit: 40  Ammo: 5

180mm Rocket Pod (Fixed)
AP: 12x4
Range: 41-60, ML
Hit: 45  Ammo: 10

Comments: As with so many of the original Tem Rey designs, the RX-75 was 
refined into a mass produced model that spawned many descendants.  The RMV-1 
Guntank II was the second mass-produced model - it is cheaper to construct, 
has slightly better range and armor, and many new weapons.  It also 
completely lost the ability to be deployed in space.  Unfortunately, the 
minimum engagement distance is almost twice as much in the RMV-1 as the RX-
75, making it a tempting target for any Zaku pilot with a Heat Hawk.  The 
RMV-1 made its first anime appearance during Kidou Senshi Z Gundam.  
(Although, given the timespan of the game, it is probable that it was in use 
in or around UC 0083.)

   *********************
    Part C: RX-77 Types
   *********************

RX-77 "Guncannon"
Physical Strength: 315, +78
Armor Value: 32, +4
Mobility: 50, +12
Enemy Detection Ability: 58, +4
Generator: 300, +75
Aptitude: B/A/B/D
Size: L
Cost: 2500, 625, 2500

Weapons:
240mm Cannon (Shoulder)
AP: 25x2
Range: 40-70, ML
Hit: 50  Ammo: 30

Missile Pod (Shoulder)
AP: 20x2
Range: 35-65, ML
Hit: 60  Ammo: 40

Beam Rifle (Fixed)
AP: 40x1
Range: 26-42, M
Hit: 60  Ammo: 20

60mm Vulcan (Fixed)
AP: 6x3
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 40  Ammo: 30

Comments: The second of Tem Rey's new mobile suits, the RX-77-2 Guncannon 
survived the attack by Denim, Slender, and Gene and was piloted by several 
members of the White Base's crew in battle.  It is surprisingly well armored 
(on par with the RX-78-2), sharing the same lunar titanium as its other 
Project V siblings.  While it is possible to close inside the effective range 
of the 60mm Vulcans, which are the primary close defense weapon of this unit, 
given the normally fluid nature of mobile suit combat that should be a rare 
occurrence.  Even though the original design of the Guncannon focused on the 
twin artillery cannons mounted on the shoulders (and exchangeable with spray 
missile launchers), the best weapon on this unit is the Beam Rifle.  The RX-
77 Guncannon first appeared during Kidou Senshi Gundam.

RX-77-3 "Guncannon-3" [aka Guncannon Heavy Arms Type]
Physical Strength: 315, +78
Armor Value: 34, +4
Mobility: 50, +12
Enemy Detection Ability: 64, +4
Generator: 325, +81
Aptitude: B/A/B/D
Size: L
Cost: 2300, 575, 2300

Weapons:
Beam Rifle (Fixed)
AP: 40x1
Range: 26-48, M
Hit: 60  Ammo: 20

Beam Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 28x2
Range: 35-65, ML
Hit: 50  Ammo: 30

Hand Grenade (Fixed)
AP: 16x1
Range: 30-45, M
Hit: 70  Ammo: 10

60mm Vulcan (Fixed)
AP: 6x3
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 40  Ammo: 30

Comments: It was clear towards the end of the One Year War that the base RX-
77 design was being rapidly outpaced by its RX-78 sibling.  Further, the high 
effectiveness of beam weaponry was especially attractive to Federal Forces 
designers.  An experimental Guncannon Heavy Arms Type was designed that 
incorporated a number of advances over the basic RX-77 type.  The 240mm 
Cannons were replaced by Beam Cannons, and the generator strengthened to 
accommodate the increased strain.  A rack for hand grenades was installed on 
the hip.  All in all, the performance of the RX-77-3 was better than the 
original RX-77-2.  The RX-77-3 Guncannon Heavy Arms Type appeared in the 
Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) collection.

RX-77D "Guncannon-D"
Physical Strength: 300, +75
Armor Value: 28, +4
Mobility: 60, +15
Enemy Detection Ability: 58, +4
Generator: 275, +68
Aptitude: A/A/C/D
Size: L
Cost: 1700, 425, 1700

Weapons:
120mm Machinegun (Fixed)
AP: 15x3
Range: 26-55, ML
Hit: 65  Ammo: 30
 
240mm Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 25x2
Range: 40-70, ML
Hit: 55  Ammo: 30

60mm Vulcan (Fixed)
AP: 6x3
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 40  Ammo: 30

Comments: Like the RX-79 series of mobile suits, the RX-77D was a limited run 
mass produced version of the RX-77 Guncannon.  The mobility has been slightly 
improved, but the armor is much weaker than the original Guncannon.  Also, 
since Beam Rifles were not widely available yet (basically, appearing only on 
the RX-78 Gundam, RX-77-2 Guncannon, and the RX-79 series of mass produced 
Gundams; the RGM-79 and RGC-80 would field the Beam Spray Rifle), this 
version has a 120mm Machinegun.  No capacity for using a Missile Launcher was 
designed, either.  The RX-77D Guncannon-D first appeared in Kidou Senshi 
Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai.

RGC-80 "GM Cannon"
Physical Strength: 290, +72
Armor Value: 21, +4
Mobility: 50, +12
Enemy Detection Ability: 58, +4
Generator: 250, +62
Aptitude: B/A/C/D
Size: L
Cost: 1200, 300, 1200

Weapons:
Beam Spray Gun (Right Hand)
AP: 35x1
Range: 26-55, ML
Hit: 70  Ammo: 30

Shield (Left Hand)*
Defense +4
Mobility -15

240mm Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 45x1
Range: 40-70, ML
Hit: 50  Ammo: 30

60mm Vulcan (Fixed)
AP: 6x3
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 30  Ammo: 30

Comments: Just as the mass production efforts of the Federal Forces led to 
the development of the RGM-79 series from the original RX-78 Gundam, the 
persistent need for mid-range heavy fire support produced a similar 
derivative from the RX-77 Guncannon.  The RGC-80 GM Cannon was developed 
later than its GM sibling, and very few were produced before the end of the 
One Year War.  One major deficiency in the GM Cannon is a lack of real short-
range protective weapons.  The 60mm Vulcans are inadequate for driving away 
enemy units, and once inside the range of the Beam Spray Gun, the GM Cannon 
is very vulnerable.  The RGC-80 GM Cannon appeared in the MSV (Mobile Suit 
Variations) collection.

RGC-83 "GM Cannon II"
Physical Strength: 315, +78
Armor Value: 25, +4
Mobility: 60, +15
Enemy Detection Ability: 64, +4
Generator: 300, +75
Aptitude: A/A/B/D

Cost: 1600, 300, 1200

Weapons:
GM Rifle (Fixed)
AP: 16x3

Hit: 65  Ammo: 30

Shield (Left Hand)*
Defense +4
Mobility -15

Beam Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 28x2
Range: 35-65, ML
Hit: 55  Energy: 30

Beam Saber (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 70  Energy: 25

60mm Vulcan (Fixed)
AP: 6x3
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 40  Ammo: 30

Comments: The renewed development of Gundams and GMs in the three years 
following the One Year War naturally produced an interest in revitalizing and 
correcting the deficiencies of the original RGC-80 GM Cannon.  The much 
improved RGC-83 GM Cannon II has many of the same features as its sibling 
RGM-79N GM Custom, including the GM Rifle and Beam Saber.  Further, a pair of 
high performance beam cannons provide excellent mid-to-long range fire 
support capacity.  The generator has also been improved to accommodate these 
new weapons.  The GM Cannon II does not suffer from a weak short range combat 
capacity (with the Beam Saber), and is an excellent fire support platform 
(considering that it was mass produced).  The RGC-83 GM Cannon II first 
appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

Comments: No real discussion of the mobile suits of the Universal Century is 
complete without reference to the RX-78-2, the only fully functional Gundam 
prototype that survived the attack on Side 7.  The Gundam and its legendary 
pilot, Newtype Amuro Rey, helped shaped the development of GMs and mobile 
suits for years to come.  This version of the RX-78 lacks the Beam Javelin 
and Super Napalm that was shown in the TV anime, but in all other respects is 
a high performance, excellent mobile suit that should serve as the backbone 
of your game until the RX-78NT1 Alex is available.  Most notable is its 
ability to deploy in any kind of terrain (although it operates at a penalty 
underwater).  Generally, the Beam Rifle is your best weapon.  The RX-78 
Gundam first appears in the original Kidou Senshi Gundam.

Comments: Towards the end of the One Year War, it was obvious that the RX-78-
2 Gundam was over-worked and under-powered compared to some of the mobile 
armors (and even mobile suits - the MS-14A Gelgoog being a prime example) 
that the Duchy of Zeon was deploying.  While the basic design of the RX-78 
was solid, its needed extra armor and heavy weapons to conduct heavy assault 
against mobile armors.  One proposal to solve this problem was the FA-78-1 
Full Armor Gundam.  Additional armor would be layered over the Gundam, and a 
heavy shoulder mounted cannon would provide extra firepower.  Further, the 
single beam rifle would be replaced with a 2-barrel version.  In the end, 
this project was scrapped, however.  The FA-78-1 Full Armor Gundam appears in 
the MSV (Mobile Suit Variations).

Comments: A major problem towards the end of the One Year War was the rapidly 
developing Newtype skills of the Gundam's pilot, Amuro Rey.  A project was 
undertaken to develop a new, high reaction Gundam, which would also 
incorporate many new technological advances.  The original Core Block System 
was replaced with a 360 degree panoramic cockpit.  Layered, modular armor 
upgrades were introduced.  90mm Gatling Guns whose power exceeded 
conventional 120mm Machineguns were installed in both arms.  Magnetic Coating 
was installed at the joints to reduce friction.  All things considered, the 
RX-78NT1 Alex was the most impressive mobile suit of its day, and would 
remain so until the Gundam Development Project was completed.  It was a 
testament to the tactical cunning and determination of Bernard Wiseman, the 
last surviving member of the Cyclops Team, that a Zaku II was able to 
severely damage the Alex while it was being tested by pilot Christina 
Mackenzie.  Wiseman lost his life in the attempt, but averted the need to use 
a nuclear weapon to destroy the Alex and the colony it was being tested in.  
Many of the developments introduced in the Alex were never seen for another 3 
years.  The RX-78NT1 Alex appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: War in the 
Pocket.

Special Note: Yes, the Alex has lower mobility than the original RX-78 
Gundam.  I'm not sure why that is (the Alex should have higher mobility), but 
the Alex is still a better mobile suit because of the 90mm Gatling Gun.  
Possibly the most useful weapon in the game until the RX-78GP series is 
unlocked.

Comments: The RGM series of mecha are mass produced copies of the RX-78 
Gundam.  The original RGM-79 was in fact developed from the data that was 
collected during Amuro's piloting of the original Gundam.  Although nowhere 
as powerful as its predecessor (especially lacking is the strong lunar 
titanium; the RGM-79 is armored with conventional titanium alloys), the RGM-
79 has several advantages, especially in armament, over the standard Zeon MS-
06F Zaku II.  However, the prime engagement range of the RGM-79 is much 
narrower than that of the Zaku II - it is usually best to engage targets 
between 26 and 36 units of distance.  (That is, farther than the minimum 
distance of the Beam Spray Gun but within medium engagement range.)  The Beam 
Saber does more damage than a Heat Hawk, but is less accurate and uses more 
energy.  Later developments of the RGM-79 would prove to be much more useful.  
The RGM-79 GM first appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

Comments: The RGM-79 (G), or Rikusen GM, was a mass produced version of the 
RGM-79 specifically designed for Land Combat.  Unlike the original GM, which 
is usable in almost any terrain (except underwater), the RGM-79 (G) cannot be 
deployed in space.  Its armament is also quite altered from the earlier RGM-
79 - there is no shield, nor is the excellent Beam Spray Gun available for 
use on this variant.  The primary difference between the GM and Rikusen GM, 
however, is the alloys used in its armor.  Lunar titanium was used in the 
production of the RGM-79 (G), making it much more durable.  Consequently, 
very few of these units were produced during the One Year War.  The RGM-79 
(G) Rikusen GM first appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai.

Comments: Project V, the development of the RX-78 Gundam, produced a quantity 
of spare parts that had no use once the decision to forgo mass production of 
full RX-78's was made.  (The Federal Forces instead chose to produce the RGM-
79.)  However, these spare parts were cobbled together to produce the RX-79 
(G) series of Land Combat Mass Produced Gundams.  These have the identical 
lunar titanium armor as the original, but have lower generator output and 
most notably far lower mobility.  The armament is also slightly different 
from the RX-78.  The only major deployment of the RX-79 (G) in the anime was 
in Southeast Asia.  Thus, the first appearance of the RX-79 (G) Rikusen 
Gundam was in Kidou Senshi Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai.

Comments: As mentioned earlier, the RX-79 (G) units were produced from spare 
parts.  Consequently, no replacement parts were available for damaged units.  
When Shou-i Shiro Amada severely damaged his RX-79 (G) in an encounter with 
the new Zeon mobile armor Apsaras, field mechanics rebuilt the unit with a 
variety of parts, giving it an entirely new look.  Upgrades to several key 
areas were also effected during this process.  Generally speaking, this unit 
is equal to the original RX-78 in many areas, but can only effectively be 
used in relatively flat ground.  The RX-79 (G) Ez8 appears in Kidou Senshi 
Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai.

Range: 10-25, SM

Comments: While the RGM-79 GM was in many ways a success, its performance 
still was lackluster.  Generally speaking, it was only slightly superior to 
the aging MS-06F Zaku II, and the new generation of Zeon mobile suits 
appearing late in the One Year War (MS-09 and MS-14 families, especially) far 
outclassed the original GM.  The RGM-79G variant sports an improved arsenal 
as well as some minor improvements to the mobile suit's abilities.  The cost, 
however, was greater than the RGM-79, and for such a minor performance 
increase.  Few units were produced, most finding their way into colony 
defense.  The RGM-79G GM Command appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: War in 
the Pocket.

RGM-79N "GM Custom"

Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 45  Ammo: 30

Comments: The Federal Forces had, even since the inception of the RGM-79 GM, 
been looking for a higher performance replacement.  Possibly the best 
incarnation of the standard GM line, the RGM-79N appeared toward the latter 
half of UC 0083.  While it lacked a Beam Rifle, the excellent GM Rifle could 
inflict serious damage at a high rate of fire.  The mobility of the RGM-79N 
was finally high enough to maintain a semblance of parity with Zeon mobile 
suits like the MS-09R Rick Dom and MS-14 Gelgoog series.  However, the high 
cost of producing these units versus a normal GM meant that most GM Customs 
were issued to ace and veteran pilots.  Still, in the hands of such a pilot, 
the GM Custom could acquit itself very nicely.  The RGM-79N GM Custom first 
appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

RGM-79Q "GM Quell"
Physical Strength: 310, +77

60mm Vulcan (Fixed)
AP: 6x3
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 45  Ammo: 30

Comments: One of the major repercussions of Operation Stardust was the 
formation of a special fighting force to stop potential outbreaks such as the 
Delaz Fleet.  The name of that unit was the Titans, and a special GM variant 
was developed as a stop-gap measure until newer mobile suits could be 
developed for the Titan's use.  The RGM-79Q GM Quell (possibly in reference 
to the Titan's mission to quell resistance) is a minor improvement over the 
RGM-79N GM Custom.  The RGM-79Q GM Quell appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: 
Stardust Memories.

Comments: The latter battles of the One Year War had shown some of the major 
deficiencies in the original RGM-79.  Primary among these were its low 
mobility (especially when compared to its RX-78 predecessor) and poor armor.  
During the years between the One Year War and right before the Delaz Fleet 
launched Operation Stardust, the Federation conducted research on upgrading 
these characteristics of the GM, as well as developing new equipment for 
mobile suits.  The result was the prototype "Powered GM", which was designed 
primarily as a testbed for such equipment.  Testing on the Powered GM and the 
GM Jetpack was being conducted at the Torrington, Australia GM Proving 
Grounds up until the beginning of Operation Stardust.  One drawback to the 
retrofitting and prototype nature of the Powered GM was the bulky external 
modules used to install and test the new equipment.  The RGM-79 (PWD) Powered 
GM first appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

RGM-79SC "GM Sniper Custom"

Beam Saber (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-25, S
Hit: 75  Energy: 25

Comments: Even though the RGM-79 GM was designed for simple mass production, 
it became clear that minor variations could be produced for special missions 
while still retaining the general cockpit and piloting characteristics of the 
original, making transitions between the various models easy for experienced 
pilots.  Veteran and ace pilots might be allowed to pilot the RGM-79SC GM 
Sniper Custom, instantly recognizable by the heat shield (resembling a blocky 
set of goggles) placed over the head sensors to protect against the heat 
discharge from the increased performance of this unit.  However, the GM 
Sniper Custom remained rare due to its considerably higher production cost.  
The RGM-79SC GM Sniper Custom appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) 
collection.

Comments: Much like its predecessor, the RGM-79SC GM Sniper Custom, the GM 
Sniper II was designed as a special issue high performance long-range attack 
mobile suit.  The second of its line, the GM Sniper II is much improved over 
the original, especially in its generator capacity.  However, its armaments 
leave much to be desired - especially since this mobile suit lacks any mid-
range high rate of fire weapon (such as the Hand Beam Gun).  Used properly, 
this suit can be effective.  The RGM-79SP GM Sniper II appears in Kidou 
Senshi Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket.

Comments: While the Principality of Zeon spent a great deal of time and 
materiel in developing an array of underwater mobile suits, the Federal 
Forces did not match their efforts.  This particular variation of the general 
RGM-79 type is basically a GM specially armed and designed for underwater 
combat.  Instead of beam weaponry, which historically has poor underwater 
performance, a high rate of fire missile launcher gun was supplemented with 
torpedoes and used to equip this unit.  A conventional beam saber was 
replaced with a beam pick.  Generally, however, considering the intense 
effort Zeon designers placed in underwater mobile suits, the RAG-79 Aqua GM 
is not really able to compete with designs like that MSM-07 Z'Gok or MSM-03 
Acguy.  The RAG-79 Aqua GM appears only in Kunio Ookawara's MS Collection 
(aka M-MSV).

Comments: A worthy upgrade to the original RAG-79 Aqua GM, the RAG-79-G1 
Gundiver (also known as the Waterproof Gundam) sports a beam rifle 
specifically designed for underwater combat.  Instead of a missile launcher 
gun, a high performance harpoon gun was equipped (which however has much 
reduced range).  Also, a better torpedo was installed.  Generally, this is a 
good underwater mobile suit capable of dealing on a equal footing with any of 
its Zeon counterparts (except for mobile armors such as the MAM-07 Grabro or 
customized suits like the MSM-07E).  The RAG-79-G1 Gundiver appears only in 
Kunio Ookawara's MS Collection (aka M-MSV).

--------------------------------------
Section 5: Principality of Zeon Mecha
--------------------------------------

    The Principality of Zeon has the distinction of producing the first real 
mobile suits, starting with the MS-05 Zaku I.  Produced by the Zeonic 
Corporation, the mobile suit would revolutionize warfare in the Universal 
Century alongside the other two major developments: Minvosky physics and the 
Newtype effect.

    Unlike the Federal Forces, which was able to virtually dictate new design 
and development of mobile suits, and which operated from a single design 
standpoint, the Principality of Zeon had several independent corporations 
that produced mobile suits.  Their designs varied, but most had a uniform 
'look' to them - domed heads, hovering leg thrusters or skirts, and of course 
the single camera placed on a horizontally aligned track.  The cyclopean 
fearsomeness of the original Zaku was probably not lost on those soldiers who 
had to face it in combat.

    Even given the panoply of Zeon mobile suits, their basic control systems 
and operational design allows them to be categorized into several major 
families:

     MS-06 Types (designs built around the MS-05/MS-06 Zaku family)
     MS-09 Types (designs built around the MS-09 Dom family)
     MS-14 Types (designs built around the MS-14 Gelgoog family)
     MS-15 Types (the MS-15 Gyan close-combat mobile suit)
     YMS-16 Types (the prototype YMS-16M Xamel mobile artillery)
     MS-18E Types (the prototype MS-18E Kaempfer assault mobile suit)
     Zeon Underwater Types (special use underwater mobile suits)
     Psycommu Types (Newtype mobile suits and armor)

     While members of each family often look very different, their control 
systems were similar.  For example, Zeon Underwater Types traditionally used 
hydrojets for underwater maneuvers, and a pilot familiar with their use would 
be able to carry over some experience from one model to another.

     The irony is that the very strength of Zeon mobile suits were their 
demise.  The unrivalled performance of the MS-06F Zaku II lead to a period of 
stunted mobile suit development until the debut of the RX-78 Gundam.  The 
excellent but specialized mobile suits of the Principality of Zeon, such as 
the MS-18E Kaempfer, were never produced in sufficient numbers to impact the 
war.  Even the MS-14 Gelgoog, arguably superior to the RX-78 Gundam, never 
had a chance to make an impact on the final outcome of the war.  Too many 
resources and too much time was spent developing niche mobile suits, and by 
the time the new mobile suits arrived, most experienced Zeon pilots were 
dead, having met their fate in older Zaku II's and Rick Doms.

Comments: The first true mobile suit, the Zaku I is a bit outdated to fight 
alongside mobile suits developed for the One Year War.  It bears many 
similarities to the MS-06F Zaku II, especially in the general design of the 
munitions.  The 105mm Machinegun, however, is capable of fairly short range 
combat (17 units of distance is Short for most units).  There are really two 
main problems to the Zaku I - its paper thin armor and low mobility.  (The 
ridiculously low generator rating would be a problem, except the weapons 
don't actually use that much energy.)  Nonetheless, a skilled pilot in a Zaku 
I might be able to defeat newer mobile suits like the RGM-79 GM or MS-06F 
Zaku II.  Attempting to confront a high-performance mobile suit with the Zaku 
I is a good object lesson in the importance of mobility to mobile suit 
warfare.  The MS-05 Zaku I first appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

Comments: The robust MS-06F Zaku II and its many variants served the 
Principality of Zeon well beyond the One Year War.  The basic armaments (a 
ranged rapid fire tank-caliber machine gun or bazooka, coupled with a short 
range beam or heat weapon) would define mobile suit weaponry for years to 
come.  Although the Zaku II was clearly incapable of handling the newer 
Federation mobile suits, in experienced hands it is more than capable of 
defeating a RGM-79 GM.  The main difference between the GM and Zaku II is the 
prime engagement range.  The Zaku II has a larger range to work with its 
120mm Machinegun or Zaku Bazooka, and a skilled pilot can 'hang' inside of 
the range of Federation ranged weapons (Beam Spray Gun) but outside of true 
melee range (Heat Hawk, Beam Saber).  In this case, the 120mm Machinegun can 
provide superior firepower when compared to the 60mm Vulcans that cover this 
key 'sweet spot' for many Federal Forces GM types.  The Zaku II is also quite 
a formidable close combat unit; although the Heat Hawk does slightly less 
damage, it is far more accurate and takes less than half the energy of the 
Beam Saber on a GM.  The MS-06F Zaku II first appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

Comments: It is well to remember that the Principality of Zeon is based in 
Side 3, on the far side of the Moon.  The original MS-06F Zaku II was 
optimized for space deployment, and therefore used a series of thrusters 
stored in the legs for movement.  Once Zeon forces established themselves on 
the Earth, it was clear that space-borne equipment was not needed for land-
based Zaku II troops.  The result was the MS-06J Rikusen (or Ground Combat) 
Zaku II.  The Rikusen Zaku II replaces the leg thrusters with a set of 
effective Missile Pods, and also carries several Crackers - multi-studded 
grenades.  Occasionally, the Rikusen Zaku II has been known to field the 
turret and cannon from a Magella Attack Tank instead of a more conventional 
Machinegun or Bazooka.  All in all, the Rikusen Zaku II proved a useful and 
powerful version for land deployment.  The MS-06J Rikusen Zaku II first 
appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai.

MS-06R1 "Koukidou Zaku" [High Mobility Zaku]

Weapons:
120mm Machinegun (Right Hand)
AP: 15x3

Hit: 50  Ammo: 50

Zaku Bazooka (Right Hand)

Hit: 60  Ammo: 20

Heat Hawk (Fixed)
AP: 20x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 70  Energy: 10

Comments: While the MS-06F Zaku II was a capable space mobile suit, the 
thrusters in the legs were clearly insufficient for the kind of high-speed 
maneuvers skilled pilots could and needed to put the mobile suit through.  
After prototype testing, the MS-06R1 Koukidou Zaku was produced in limited 
numbers for deployment to ace and veteran pilots.  The major difference 
between the MS-06F and MS-06R1 is the whopping mobility increase.  Even an </pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
average pilot in a MS-06R1 should be able to outmaneuver and defeat an RGM-
79, possibly even a newer GM variant.  Shin Matsunaga, the 'White Wolf of 
Solomon', piloted a famous all-white Koukidou Zaku.  The MS-06R1 Koukidou 
Zaku appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) collection.

MS-06R2 "Koukidou Zaku Kouki" [High Mobility Zaku Final]
Physical Strength: 290, +72

Heat Hawk (Fixed)
AP: 20x1

Comments: The robust, proven nature of the Zaku design lent itself to many 
variants and upgrades that built upon the same cockpit and piloting systems.  
In this way, pilots with considerable experience would not have to endure a 
long down-time of retraining and check flights in order to qualify on a brand 
new mobile suit.  Such is the case with the MS-06R2, the final version of the 
High Mobility Zaku produced.  Unlike other prototype and testbed versions, 
the MS-06R2 was basically a specially souped-up mobile suit for combat aces.  
The 360mm Giant Bazooka from the MS-09 Dom series was substituted for the 
traditional 280mm Zaku Bazooka, but in other respects the armament is the 
same.  A modest, but noticeable increase in mobility and generator capacity 
was also effected.  All things considered, this was as far as the basic Zaku 
frame could be taken.  Four units were produced, one remaining at the Zeon 
Granada Base for further testing.  Johnny Ridden became a pilot of one of the 
remaining three suits.  The MS-06R2 Koukidou Zaku Kouki appears in the Mobile 
Suit Variations (MSV) collection.

MS-06D "Desert Zaku"
Physical Strength: 290, +72

Hit: 35  Ammo: 30

Cracker Pod (Fixed)
AP: 4x4
Range: 26-32, M
Hit: 70  Ammo: 10

Comments: Considering the extensive area of Zeon operations, several 
different mobile suit variants were developed for difficult terrain and 
climate deployments.  The constant sand and high heat of tropical and desert 
environments proved difficult, especially on mobile suit maintenance.  The 
MS-06D Desert Zaku was specially designed for desert conditions, and 
protected against sand and other environmental hazards.  Its armament is 
similar, but slightly less varied, than a MS-06J Rikusen Zaku II (from which 
it was developed).  However, the accuracy of the 120mm Machinegun is slightly 
higher.  The MS-06D Desert Zaku appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) 
collection.

MS-06K "Zaku Cannon"
Physical Strength: 290, +72

180mm Cannon (Fixed)
AP: 45x1
Range: 37-70, L
Hit: 40  Ammo: 20

Comments: Just as Zeon mobile suit design altered the plans of the Federal 
Forces units, reports on the RX-77 Guncannon and RX-78 Gundam caused the Zeon 
California Base to produce a mid-range fire support variant of the MS-06J, 
the MS-06K Zaku Cannon.  In many ways, it resembles a RGC-80 GM Cannon.  
However, the tremendous recoil from the shoulder mounted 180mm Cannon and 
general poor performance lead to a limited production run.  Ian Greydon and 
his unit used the MS-06K in the defense of the California Base until the end 
of the war.  The MS-06K appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) 
collection.

MS-06V "Zaku Tank"
Physical Strength: 260, +65

Comments: Even though the Principality of Zeon had massive mobile suit 
production capabilities and started with a superior number of units, field 
commanders often found that full mobile suit replacements were few and far 
between.  Cut-off or undersupplied units had to replace losses whenever and 
however they could.  By mating the tracks and body of a Magella Attack Tank 
with the torso and head of a MS-06F Zaku II, a last-ditch defensive unit was 
created that proved to be extremely useful for construction and combat 
engineering purposes.  In the front lines, however, a MS-06V Zaku Tank was 
slow, pitifully armored, and had little in the way of armament.  Consignment 
to a Zaku Tank in combat was, essentially, death.  Still, it was a highly 
prized unit, for it was cheap to produce and useful in non-combat purposes.  
The MS-06V Zaku Tank appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam: 08th MS Shoutai.

MS-21C "Dra-C"
Physical Strength: 390, +97

Hit: 40  Ammo: 30

Beam Saber (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 80  Energy: 25

Comments: The terrible losses suffered during the One Year War did not, 
however, completely eliminate all Zeon mobile suits from the Earth Sphere.  
Many Zeon mobile suits, intact or damage, remained hidden or in Zeon 
possession.  (Some were turned over to the Federal Forces for study or use in 
aggressor training.)  The Delaz Fleet, short on mobile suits and expecting 
only space operations, cobbled together the torso and head of a Zaku with 
large propellant tanks and boosters.  The resulting high mobility space 
attack suit was armed modestly with a 40mm Vulcan cannon and a Beam Saber.  
Still, it could provide surprising support for space operations, and at the 
very least could screen for operations by real mobile suits.  The MS-21C Dra-
C appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

MS-06S "Dozle Sen'you Zaku II" [Dozle Personal Use Zaku II/Zaku II Commander]

Comments: Chuu-shou Dozle Zabi (a member of the ruling Zabi family in the 
Principality of Zeon) had a custom made Zaku for personal inspection tours 
and combat.  Sporting a tremendously oversized Heat Hawk and generally being 
a high performance mobile suit, the MS-06S (which was the general model 
number for Zaku Commander Types) performs far above the normal expectations 
for a Zaku.  The MS-06S appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

AP: 7x5
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 60  Ammo: 30

Comments: As the One Year War raged, it became clear that the MS-06F Zaku II 
was a good mobile suit that was nonetheless hopelessly out of date.  With the 
debut of the RX-78-2 Gundam, the quest for more powerful mobile suits took on 
a new urgency.  The Zeonic Corporation's successor to the MS-06 Zaku family 
was the MS-07 Gouf.  Solely designed as a land combat model, the Gouf in its 
original configuration (a standard but not a Gatling Shield) lacked any long 
range armament.  (Beyond 36 units of distance.)  The Gouf had a limited 
production run, being quickly replaced by the MS-09 Dom which proved to be a 
more highly mobile, well armed mobile suit.  The MS-07 Gouf appeared in Kidou 
Senshi Gundam.

Special Note: You can choose to take the Gatling Shield, Shield, or neither.

MS-07C-3 "Gouf Shuubusou" [Gouf Heavy Arms]
Physical Strength: 300, +75

85mm Cannon [85mm Cannon Hou] (Fixed)
AP: 7x5
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 50  Ammo: 30

Comments: A major deficiency in the first production runs of the MS-07 Gouf 
was the lack of ranged armament.  While the Heat Rod and short range 85mm 
Cannon were highly effective, experienced GM pilots could easily stay outside 
of their range and whittle away enemy resistance with their Beam Spray Guns.  
The MS-07C-3 Gouf Heavy Arms was an attempt to correct the deficiency.  Most 
of the original armament was scrapped, and instead emphasis was placed adding 
ranged capacity.  A standard Giant Bazooka from the MS-09 Dom family 
supplemented the 85mm Cannons.  Still, this version is relatively weak, and a 
poor choice considering that actual MS-09 Doms would have been more easily 
available.  The MS-07C-3 Gouf appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) 
collection.

MS-07H "Gouf Flight Type"

Hit: 70  Energy: 15

Comments: While Gouf production en masse ceased relatively early in the 
mobile suit's lifetime, continued experimentation and variation in the Zeon 
tradition was still performed on the suit.  Attempts to increase the ground 
performance of the Gouf by making it atmosphere flight capable lead to the 
MS-07H Gouf Flight Type.  This incarnation essentially combines the benefits 
of the C variant (Heavy Arms) with the main variant.  Pilots could choose 
between the high damage, longer ranging Giant Bazooka or high rate-of-fire 
Gatling Shield (which does, indeed, count as a shield).  The MS-07H Gouf 
Flight Type appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) collection.

Comments: Long part of Zeon tradition was the heavy customization of mobile 
suits, both to fit individual niche missions and for high ranking aces.  
M'kuve had his own personalized Gouf model, which is generally identical to 
the early MS-07B Gouf type (which originally did not have a Gatling Shield).  
As with most personal command types, the MS-07B M'kuve Sen'you Gouf was 
better built and therefore had slightly increased performance.  The MS-07B 
M'kuve Sen'you Gouf appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

Comments: While the retrofit MS-06J Rikusen Zaku II was adequate for 
Earthside combat duty, the Principality of Zeon was really looking for a new, 
higher performance dedicated land combat suit.  Shortly after the 
introduction of the MS-07 Gouf, the MS-09 Dom made its own debut.  It 
followed much more traditional lines in terms of armament and configuration, 
which endeared it to existing Zaku pilots.  Still, the lack of a high rate of 
fire medium range weapon (equivalent to the 120mm Zaku Machinegun) made the 
Dom more effective in the hands of aces such as the infamous Kuroi Sanrensei 
(Black Trinary) of Gaia, Ortega, and Mash.  The MS-09 and its variants were a 
tremendous success, and many units were produced to replace Zakus of all 
types - beating out the MS-07 Gouf in the process.  The MS-09 Dom first 
appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

Special Note: The Scattering Beam, if it successfully hits, has a very high 
chance of completely freezing all functions of the target for a short time.

Comments: MS-09 Dom units stationed Earthside found that tropical and desert 
conditions adversely affected the performance of their mobile suit - a 
problem, since one of the primarily advantages of the Dom was its high 
maneuverability.  Just as with the MS-06D Desert Zaku, a variant was created 
with shielding against sand and heat as well as other minor weatherproofing 
changes.  The resultant MS-09F/TROP Dom Tropen (from the German for tropical) 
was an excellent desert fighting mobile suit.  The normal 360mm Giant Bazooka 
was substituted with a 880mm raketen (German for rocket) bazooka, and this 
version also sports the optional Sturm Faust (essentially, a handheld linear 
bazooka).  In general, the MS-09F is superior to the original.  The MS-
09F/TROP Dom Tropen appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

Comments: Even after the One Year War ended, development and improvements to 
the venerable MS-09 Dom continued.  The addition of 30mm Vulcans to the head 
and general improvements to the unit marked the MS-09G Dowadge, which was 
otherwise very similar to its Dom predecessors.  Dowadges would serve in a 
variety of military and para-military outfits up to and beyond the Grypps 
War, a testament to the soundness of the original design.  The MS-09G 
appeared in Kidou Senshi Z Gundam and Kidou Senshi Gundam ZZ, but 
historically was produced before UC 0083 (making it fit the time period of 
this game).

Comments: Unlike many Zeon mobile suits, the MS-09 Dom started its life as a 
ground-based mobile suit.  Its impressive performance and proven ability made 
it an attractive immediate replacement to the aging MS-06F Zaku II, and a 
space variant was constructed.  The MS-09R Rick Dom was virtually identical 
to the ground based MS-09, save for variant minor changes made to make it 
spaceworthy.  During the end of the One Year War, Rick Doms formed the bulk 
of front-line space mobile suits (along with whatever MS-06F Zaku II units 
still remained).

Special Note: The Scattering Beam, if it successfully hits, has a very high 
chance of completely freezing all functions of the target for a short time.

MS-14A "Gelgoog"
Physical Strength: 355, +88

Beam Sword (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 80  Energy: 25

Comments: Even without prompting from the Federal Forces, the Principality of 
Zeon was well on its way to developing a high performance replacement for the 
MS-06F Zaku II.  This project, the MS-11 Gelgoog, was suddenly cancelled and 
its specifications recast when reports of the alarming efficiency of the RX-
78-2 Gundam started surfacing.  The Federal Forces' success with E-Cap based 
portable beam weaponry forced the Principality of Zeon to counter with their 
own E-Cap carrying designs.  While the MS-09 Dom filled the temporary need 
for improved mobile suits, the now MS-14A Gelgoog was the suit they were 
looking for.  Arguably better than (or at least equal to) the RX-78 Gundam, 
the mass produced Gelgoog would have clearly trounced their RGM-79 opponents 
- if they hadn't arrived so late in the war and in insufficient numbers.  
Many unassembled Gelgoogs would survive to be finished and used by Zeon 
remnants, and a large quantity were seized by the Federal Forces for reverse 
engineering, training, and aggressor squadrons.  The Gelgoog has all the 
necessary weapons and systems for a good mobile suit, even if the original 
shield was a bit unwieldy.  The MS-14A Gelgoog first appeared in Kidou Senshi 
Gundam.

MS-14B "Koukidou Gelgoog" [High Mobility Gelgoog)]
Physical Strength: 355, +88
Armor Value: 27, +4
Mobility: 80, +20
Enemy Detection Ability: 54, +4
Generator: 300, +75

Beam Sword (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 80  Energy: 25

Comments: Unable to leave any of their designs alone, even before the MS-14A 
mass produced version of the Gelgoog was complete, a variant based on the 
prototype YMS-14S was being developed.  Though solely a space combat mobile 
suit (which had become the focus of operations following the Federal Forces' 
successful execution of Operation Odessa and the start of Operation Star 
One), the MS-14B Koukidou or High Mobility Gelgoog boasted increased 
performance versus a standard Gelgoog.  Sadly, the highly efficient beam 
rifle has been replaced in this version with a Rocket Launcher.  Otherwise, 
this is an excellent space mobile suit.  Zeon ace Johnny Ridden was one of 
several MS-14B pilots.  The MS-14B Koukidou Gelgoog appears in the Mobile 
Suit Variations (MSV) collection.

MS-14F "Gelgoog M" [Gelgoog Marine]
Physical Strength: 400, +100

Beam Saber (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 80  Energy: 28

Comments: Arguably the most popular mass produced variant of the Gelgoog, the 
MS-14F Gelgoog Marine is a highly mobile, strong mobile suit.  Some versions 
carried a 90mm Machinegun (suitable for the assault purposes intended) 
instead of a high powered beam rifle.  Also, a modified Zaku shoulder shield 
with spikes could be used as a close-combat weapon.  Instead of the 
distinctive twin Beam Swords used by the standard Gelgoog, the Gelgoog Marine 
carried a more conventional pair of Beam Sabers (like the Federation 
versions).  This excellent mobile suit would serve in many units and many 
theaters far beyond the One Year War.  The MS-14F Gelgoog Marine first 
appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

MS-14C "Gelgoog Cannon"
Physical Strength: 355, +88

Beam Sword (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 80  Energy: 25

Comments: Combining the MS-014 Gelgoog with a high powered single beam 
cannon, the MS-014C Gelgoog Cannon was envisioned as a fire support platform 
with strong anti-ship capabilities (due to its high mobility and strong 
firepower).  In general, the MS-014C performs in a similar fashion to the 
standard Gelgoog, but the ability to carry and utilize additional armament 
gives this version increased lethality that comes at the cost of some 
structural protection.  Also, heavy use of the Beam Cannon (linked to the on-
board reactor) can severely drain the power supply of the mobile suit.  The 
MS-014C Gelgoog Cannon appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) 
collection.

Special Note: You can choose to take the Missile Pod, Shield, or neither.

Beam Sword (Fixed)
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 80  Energy: 25

Comments: The MS-14JG Gelgoog Jaeger (from the German word for rifleman, 
hunter, or sniper) was a mobile suit far beyond its time, and would hint at 
the direction of units such as the AGX-04 Gerbera Tetra.  Tremendous 
detection range coupled with excellent mobility allow the Jaeger to select 
the engagement range for its advanced Beam Machinegun.  In the hands of an 
accurate pilot, the Beam Machinegun can double the damage inflicted on most 
targets.  Sadly, few of these advanced mobile suits were produced, and they 
saw little combat during the One Year War.  The MS-14JG Gelgoog Jaeger 
appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket.

MS-15 "Gyan"
Physical Strength: 355, +88

Hit: 85  Energy: 30

Shield Missile (Fixed)
AP: 10x4
Range: 26-55, ML
Hit: 60  Ammo: 30

Comments: Designed as a next generation close-combat space mobile suit, the 
MS-15 Gyan held some promise even with the lack of reliable medium or long 
ranged weapons.  The fact that it had no beam rifle or gun is somewhat 
unattractive (considering the demonstrated high effectiveness of the RX-78-2 
Gundam's Beam Rifle), but since close combat was its primary function, the 
powerful Beam Saber should have sufficed.  M'kuve served as a test pilot for 
the early Gyan prototypes, and he and his Gyan perished in a battle in the 
abandoned New Texas colony against the RX-78 Gundam.  The MS-15 Gyan appeared 
in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

20mm Vulcan (Fixed)
AP: 3x4
Range: 10-25, S
Hit: 45  Ammo: 30

Comments: The Principality of Zeon was always committed to innovative mobile 
suit design for every possible combat purpose, and the prototype YMS-16M 
Xamel reflects that design theory.  Solely a long-range mobile artillery 
unit, the Xamel is an excellent fire support platform with suprisingly high 
mobility for such a large unit.  Piloted by a crew of 2, the Xamel is however 
quite helpless in close-range combat - the 20mm Vulcans are no match for a 
determined attacker with a Beam Saber or Heat Hawk.  Few of these units were 
produced, but one was used in support of the early stages of Operation 
Stardust.  The YMS-16M Xamel appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust 
Memories.

Comments: The MS-18E Kaempfer was a prototype mobile suit designed for heavy 
assaults.  In this respect, it was a resounding success.  Carrying an 
extremely varied arsenal, it's capable of engaging enemies at a wide variety 
of ranges.  Further, it has excellent mobility and armor, as well as very 
good detection ability.  Unfortunately, the Kaempfer was unable to overcome 
the RX-78NT1 'Alex' and its pilot, Mikhail Kaminsky, was killed in action.  
The MS-18E Kaempfer first appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: War in the 
Pocket.

Hit: 30  Ammo: 20

Comments: It quickly became clear to Zeon Earthside forces that the ability 
to conduct effective underwater operations with mobile suits was necessary.  
(The Federal Forces could rely on a regular blue-water navy, but the Zeon 
forces had little in the way of naval power save a few submarine squadrons.)  
A quick retrofit of the MS-06F Zaku II was attempted, with waterproofing 
seals on the joints.  The main weapon was the Submarine Rocket (or Subroc) 
Gun, supplemented with rocket pods.  The performance of the suit was subpar, 
however, as the joints tended to leak and the mobility was highly 
compromised.  Less than 10 units were produced.  The MS-06M Zaku Marine Type 
appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) collection.

Comments: While the MS-06M (also known as the MSM-01) Zaku Marine Type was 
the 'first' underwater mobile suit, its performance left much to be desired.  
Rather than let the Zeonic Company refine their suit, the Zimmad Company 
countered with the first successful underwater mobile suit - the MSM-03 Gogg.  
While its mobility was just as pitiful as its Zaku predecessor, the Gogg was 
more heavily armed and armored - vital for underwater operations at any 
significant depth.  The mega particle cannon mounted on the main body gave it 
incredible punch, backed up by twin missile launchers.  While still not a 
challenge for real mobile suits on land, in the water it could cause 
considerable havoc and certainly would have been a menace to regular blue-
water navies.  The MSM-03 Gogg first appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

MSM-03C "Hygogg"

Hit: 80  Energy: 5

Comments: While the MSM-03 Gogg was a step in the right direction, its 
performance still left much to be desired.  Attempts to rectify some of the 
problems led to the MSM-03C Hygogg.  The mega particle cannon in the body was 
moved to the arms, and additional armaments were added - including a 
distinctive one-shot hand missile unit that could nevertheless deliver a 
potentially devastating barrage.  Armor and mobility were both improved 
(impressive, if one considers the antithetical nature of those elements).  
All in all, the MSM-03C Hygogg was a fairly strong mobile suit, especially in 
the water.  However, like many Zeon mobile suits, few were ever produced.  
The MSM-03C Hygogg appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket.

Hit: 65  Energy: 5

Comments: Unwilling to accept the failure of their MS-06M Zaku Marine Type, 
the Zeonic Company used several basic sections from their MS-06F Zaku II to 
construct an all new undewater mobile suit.  This was the MSM-04 Acguy.  
Though the Acguy lacks the impressive mega particle cannons of the Gogg, it 
has a considerable amount of more conventional weaponry, like the Rocket Pods 
in the arms and Hand Vulcans.  Unlike the versions usually seen, this Acguy 
has all of the different types of hand-based armaments available on this 
unit.  Still, like most Zeon underwater mobile suits (the MSM-07 series being 
the major exception), it has poor mobility and horrific land performance.  
The Acguy is also very lightly armored compared to the Gogg, and under-
armored when compared to the Z'Gok.  The MSM-04 Acguy first appeared in Kidou 
Senshi Gundam.

Comments: One of several prototype mobile suits designed for the planned 
attack on the Federation Jaburo headquarters, the MSM-04G Juagg was based on 
the MSM-04 Acguy design.  However, its hands were to be 320mm Rocket 
Launchers, in view of its intended fire support role for the attacking 
underwater mobile suits.  While the rockets could be exchanged for regular 
arms, in general this would have been a niche mobile suit with poor combat 
performance, had it seen duty.  Char Aznable's discovery of the entrance to 
the Jaburo base, however, thankfully spare the Juagg from ever being 
deployed.  The MSM-04G Juagg only appears in the MS-X collection.

Comments: A marriage of some of the arguably most ugly designs and weapons in 
the Zeon inventory, the MSM-04N Agguguy was the close-range counterpart to 
the MSM-04G Juagg.  The base design called for a series of Heat Rods (taken 
from the Zeonic Company's Gouf) to be installed in the hands, which could be 
exchanged for more conventional claw hands if needed.  Like the Juagg, this 
design was based on the questionable MSM-04 Acguy, and would have probably 
been an embarassment in combat.  Like many of the other mid-war Zeonic 
Company designs, the MSM-04N had a thankfully brief time-span, never being 
produced due to the rushed attack on Jaburo.  The MSM-04N Agguguy appears in 
the MS-X collection.

Comments: In preparation for a strike against the underground Federal Forces 
headquarters of Jaburo, Zeon's California Base developed a wide variety of 
special purpose mobile suits for the assault.  The EMS-05 Agg was equipped 
with a drill and laser torch in order to cut through the expected obstacles 
and other combat engineering functions normal required when breaching 
prepared defensive positions.  As Char Aznable eventually discovered the 
secret entrance to Jaburo, the need for the Agg and other suits like it was 
obviated, and the EMS-05 was relegated to the scrap pile.  The EMS-05 Agg 
appears in the Mobile Suit Variations (MSV) collection.

Hit: 50  Ammo: 10

Claw (Fixed)
AP: 30x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 75  Energy: 5

Comments: One of the more dangerous Zeon underwater mobile suit designs, the 
MSM-07 Z'Gok produced by the MIP Company built upon the successes (and 
failures) of the earlier MSM-03 Gogg and MSM-04 Acguy.  Hand-mounted Mega 
Particle Cannons were supplemented with high capacity 240mm Rocket Launchers 
- capable of dealing considerable damage if the entire barrage finds it mark.  
Unlike many other underwater mobile suits, the Z'Gok did not have bulky water 
ballast tanks - and therefore is more mobile and smaller than many of its 
compatriots.  It also has fairly decent ground performance, making it the 
amphibious assault suit of choice.  The MSM-07 Z'Gok first appeared in Kidou 
Senshi Gundam.

MSM-07E "Z'Gok-E"
Physical Strength: 355, +88

Claw (Fixed)
AP: 35x1
Range: 0-20, S
Hit: 80  Energy: 5

Comments: Though designed by the less influential MIP Company, Zeon designers 
seemed to be unable to resist the constant pressure of upgrading and 
customizing their mobile suits.  Work on the already successful MSM-07 Z'Gok 
lead to the MSM-07E (for experimental) Z'Gok-E.  This version boasted 
improved performance across the board, but was slightly larger.  Its ground 
performance also had a stunning increase - the Z'Gok-E can operate in all 
terrains save the void of space.  Also, the weapons systems were slightly 
upgraded.  Only a limited number of these improved Z'Goks were built, and of 
course underwater mobile suits turned out to have very little impact on the 
course of the war.  The MSM-07E Z'Gok-E appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0080: 
War in the Pocket.

MSM-08 "Zogok"
Physical Strength: 315, +78
Armor Value: 28, +4
Mobility: 70, +17

Commentary: The MSM-08 Zogok was another special use mobile suit designed by 
the Zeon California Base for use in the assault against Federal Forces 
headquarters in Jaburo.  Much like the EMS-05 Agg, the Zogok was designed to 
aid in the clearance and breaching of combat engineering emplacements.  So 
too, when the secret entrance to Jaburo was found, the need for the Zogok 
disappeared.  The MSM-08 Zogok appears in the MS-X collection.

MSM-10 "Zock"
Physical Strength: 430, +107
Armor Value: 33, +4
Mobility: 40, +10
Enemy Detection Ability: 64, +4
Generator: 350, +87
Aptitude: D/B/D/A
Size: XL
Cost: 3500, 875, 3500

Weapons:
Photon Maser Cannon [Photon Maser Hou] (Fixed)
AP: 30x1
Range: 16-40, ML
Hit: 50  Energy: 30

Mega Particle Cannon [Mega Ryuushi Hou] (Fixed)
AP: 30x4
Range: 25-50, ML
Hit: 30  Energy: 40

Claw
AP: 25x1
Range: 0-15, S
Hit: 60  Energy: 5

Comments: The MSM-10 Zock represented a shift away from the traditional 
underwater suit towards what might best be described as underwater mobile 
armor (similar to the MAM-07 Grabro).  The tremendous Zock had ridiculously 
low mobility, even for an underwater mobile suit, but boasted strengthened 
construction and armor equal to the protection afforded by lunar titanium.  
The weapons on this underwater leviathan included an array of four mega 
particle cannons mounted on the torso both fore and aft, as well as a photon 
maser (Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) cannon on 
the head.  The major drawback to these powerful weapons was the drain on the 
reactor.  Only a handful of Zocks were constructed.  The MSM-10 Zock appeared 
in Kidou Senshi Gundam.

    Part I: Psycommu Types
   ************************

    While pilots have a slot for Psycommu Type mobile suits/mobile armors 
piloting experience, no such suits exist in the standard MSVS game.  Most 
likely, they are present in MSVS: Zeon Carrier.  Several probable Psycommu 
Types do appear in the game as enemies (such as the MSN-02 Zeong and MAN-08 
Elmeth).

----------------------------------------------------
Section 6: Special Gundam Development Project Mecha
----------------------------------------------------

    In UC 0083, the fruits of the Federal Forces Gundam Development Project 
were beginning to bear fruit.  A series of 4 different next generation mobile 
suits, commissioned by the Federal Forces and built by Anaheim Electronics 
were developed at Anaheim's Von Braun City facilities.  It was the pair of 
mobile suits delivered via the Albion to the Torrington, Australia MS Proving 
Grounds that would be inexorably intertwined in Operation Stardust.

    The units of the Gundam Development Project are extremely powerful and 
advanced.  In order to unlock any of them, you must complete the EX missions.  
In order to do so, you must not have lost any 'Situation' single player 
battles.  If you have lost one, you must complete the game, and start over 
from the beginning (though you will still retain all pilot statistics and 
mobile suits, which makes winning a lot easier).  After completing Scenario 
20 (Mobile Suit Gundam), the game will tell you that the information for the 
Gundam Development Project has been loaded into your game.  You must then 
complete EX3 (Taigi aru Tatakai), which features Shou-i Kou Uraki in the RX-
78GP01 Zephyranthes.  In other respects, it is a duplicate of Scenario 15, 
only with a 5:00 minute time limit.  Successful completion of EX3 unlocks the 
Zephyrantes and the RX-78GP01-Fb Full Vernian.  Then, you must complete EX4 
(Akumu Futatabi) against Anavel Gato - this time, he pilots the RX-78GP02a 
Physalis with a loaded Atomic Bazooka.  Again, it is otherwise similar to 
Scenario 17, only with a 5:00 minute time limit.  Beating EX4 unlocks the 
Physalis, Stamen, and Gerbera Tetra.

    Sadly, the results of Operation Stardust and the Federal Forces' 
unwillingness to claim responsibility for the construction and arming of the 
RX-78GP02a Physalis with a nuclear warhead led to the removal of all 
materials related to the Gundam Development Project, and the 4 mobile suits 
passed into the realm of history.

RX-78GP01 "Zephyranthes"
Physical Strength: 465, +116

Comments: The first mobile suit of its family, the RX-78GP01 Zephyranthes 
(named after the zephyrlily) was designed as a potential mass produced 
replacement for the current RGM-79N GM Custom.  In general, it followed the 
design of the RX-78 Gundam, incorporating new technological advances made 
durig the 3 years following the One Year War.  The result was an excellent 
(if somewhat costly for a potentially mass produced unit) mobile suit.  Both 
suit and pilot (Shou-i Kou Uraki) eventually proved strong enough to face the 
'Nightmare of Solomon', Sho-sa Anavel Gato, and played a pivotal role in the 
final outcome of Operation Stardust.  Eschewing multi-mission arsenals, the 
Zephyranthes' weapon systems reflect a solid basic package: Beam Rifle for 
mid to long range combat, Shield, Beam Saber for close combat, and 60mm 
Vulcans as supplements.  The RX-78GP01 Zephyranthes appeared in Kidou Senshi 
Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

Comments: There was a major limitation to the RX-78GP01 - it was a dedicated 
land combat mobile suit.  (The third and fourth mobile suits in the Gundam 
Project, the Dendrobium Orchis and Gerbera, were designed for space 
deployment).  When its pilot, Kou Uraki, took the Zephyranthes into battle to 
defend the Albion, it was severely damaged due to both incorrect balancer 
data and the lack of space combat ability in the mobile suit.  A major 
retrofit and overhaul was conducted at Anaheim Electronics' Von Braun City 
lunar base, which gave the mobile suit the ability to deploy in space.  The 
new RX-78GP01-Fb Full Vernian Zephyranthes had superior mobility and could 
deploy in space, but otherwise was unchanged from the original design.  Both 
the Full Vernian and Physalis would eventually be destroyed shortly after the 
nuclear attack conducted by the Delaz Fleet against the Federal Forces' base 
at Kompei Island (aka Solomon) in UC 0083.  The RX-78GP01-Fb Full Vernian 
appears in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

Comments: The Anarctic Treaty signed during the course of the One Year War 
specifically forbade certain types of weapons from being used, including the 
dropping of colonies and nuclear attacks.  Sadly, this did not prevent the 
Federal Forces or Anaheim Electronics from developing a mobile suit whose 
sole purpose was the safe and effective delivery of a Mk-82 nuclear warhead 
in a tactical situation.  The Physalis (named after the groundcherry) is 
essentially built around the shoulder mounted Atomic Bazooka; even the 
heavier shield was added to withstand the pressure wave from an atomic blast.  
However, once its nuclear payload has been expended, the GP02a must rely on 
close range weaponry to stage a quick exit from the battlefield.  
Nonetheless, a direct hit with the Atomic Bazooka on a mobile suit should 
prove fatal to the target.  The RX-78GP02a Physalis first appeared in Kidou 
Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

Special Note: It may come as a relief to players that the default 
configuration of the Physalis does NOT enable the Atomic Bazooka.  Since I've 
never seen the computer use anything but the default configuration, the 
Physalis you'll see in the Single combat section shouldn't have the Atomic 
Bazooka.  Anavel Gato in Scenario EX4, though, DOES have one, and he has 
every intention of hitting you with it.

Comments: Arguably the only Federal Forces 'mobile armor' ever developed was 
the tremendous RX-78GP03 Dendrobium Orchis (named after the orchid).  
Envisioned for space area defense, the Orchis was build around what amounted 
to an altered RX-78GP01, the RX-78GP03S Dendrobium Stamen.  There were 
several important changes to the cockpit, such as the panoramic 360 degree 
display (first seen on the RX-78NT1 Alex).  As such, no Core Block System was 
installed.  Minor alterations to the exterior of the RX-78GP03S which served 
as the inner core suit for the Orchis included latches for mating with the 
weapons containers.  Still, a wider variety of armaments is available on the 
Stamen versus its other Gundam Project siblings, since the Folding Bazooka 
normally carried on the Orchis carries over to the Stamen form.  The RX-
78GP03S Stamen first appeared in Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

Comments: It may be surprising that the AMX-04 Gerbera Tetra (named after the 
Transvaal daisy) is classified as a RX-78GP type.  The RX-78 GP series were 
mobile suits developed by Anaheim Electronics for the Federal Forces.  While 
the first three suits of that line were eventually delivered to the Federal 
Forces (one of them being subsequently stolen), there was a fourth mobile 
suit that was part of the Gundam Development Project.  This was the RX-78GP04 
Gerbera.  Designed as an all-purpose space mobile suit, it sought to fill the 
same niche as the GP01 Zephyranthes only in space.  However, as the RX-78GP01 
Fb demonstrated, there was no real need for a space-only mobile suit - a 
retrofitted RX-78GP01 could fill both mission specifications.  Anaheim 
Electronics therefore found itself with a prototype that the Federal Forces 
did not need or want.  The unfinished Gerbera was delivered to the Cima Fleet </pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
by Anaheim (known for its double dealings), and was slightly redesigned to 
fit a more "Zeon" look.  The result was the Gerbera Tetra.

Interestingly, the Gerbera Tetra has the potential to be one of the strongest 
mobile suits of its family.  The optional Sturm Booster doubles the basic 
mobility of the Gerbera Tetra.  It does suffer from a lack of weaponry and a 
slightly weaker generator, but the Beam Machinegun is a solid weapon that can 
outperform the GP family of Beam Rifles in damage and range (should a 
majority of the shots hit).  For all its mobility, the Gerbera Tetra and its 
pilot, Cima Garahau, met a catastrophic death at the hands of the RX-78GP03 
Dendrobium Orchis.  The AGX-04 Gerbera Tetra first appeared in Kidou Senshi 
Gundam 0083: Stardust Memories.

Special Note: I do not believe the Gerbera Tetra in Single encounters is 
equipped with the Sturm Booster.

Section 8: Credits
-------------------

    There are several people without whose publicly available resources this 
document could have never been complied:

    www.mahq.net, whose information helped me confirm the translations of 
some mecha and pilot names;

    Jeffrey's J<->E Dictionary Server (linear.mv.com/), an excellent on-line 
dictionary.

    Also, special credit is given to Burke Rukes' Big List o' Gundam Mecha, a 
superb source of information on even the most obscure mobile suits.  Much of 
the series information and confirmation of the weapons systems names was 
obtained from that work.

Section 10: Miscellaneous
--------------------------

As can be expected, the Operations Guide/FAQ/Walkthrough (whatever you want 
to call it) for Mobile Suit Gundam: MSVS is forthcoming.  All scenario data, 
pilot information, etc. has been written down, all I need to do is type it 
up.  That should make this wonderful little simulation playable for even 
those who do not speak any Japanese (as it will contain full Easytype menu 
translations).  After that, I have to finish the Harobot Operations Guide (or 
I may do that before the MSVS Guide, depending) before moving on to other 
projects.

Also, expect a re-release of all previous documents to catch up new 
authorizations.  It's a good deal of work, and should occupy most of the 
summer ...
