WHAT IS "ENGACHO!"?
-------------------

If you have even the slightest bit of curiosity as to what on earth 
this game is about, I invite you to visit Engacho!'s official website 
at http://engacho.nac.co.jp, and take a gander at the home page. :D  

Yes indeed, at first glance Engacho! appears to be one of _those_ 
games, an odd, totally off-the-wall Japanese title whose chances of a 
US release are like 1000000000000000000 to 1 (not forgetting that it's 
also for the B&W WonderSwan, mind you).  But then again, if you could 
picture an animated sequence in which that huge flying butt defecates 
all over you, or a scene in which the large nose monster throws a 
massive snot rocket at you, how else are you supposed to think? =P

Engacho! was released for the Bandai WonderSwan in late 1999, and was 
developed by Nihon Application (anyone else remember "Last Imperial 
Prince" for the PC-FX?).  The name "Engacho!" is derived from a game 
played by Japanese children, very similar to the "cooties" game played 
by kids here in the US.  The goal of the kid's game, much like cooties, 
is to avoid being tainted by someone else's 'contagion' (this is 
usually spread by touching an unsuspecting person).  If you get 
touched, you'll become infected by the contagion, until you can pass it 
on to someone else.  The WonderSwan game Engacho! is loosely based on 
this concept.  As a young boy, Sunzuki-kun, you must prove yourself as 
a man to your domineering father (or "Chichi").  To do so, you must 
complete a series of puzzles in various rooms; each puzzle pits you 
against members of the infectious OOPS FIVE (the characters seen on the 
box art).  

Engacho! for WonderSwan is described as a "wakige"; this is a 
concatenation of the Japanese words "waki" (meaning "side" or "aside") 
and "geemu" ("game").  Each stage takes place in a room with spaces to 
walk on (the maximum size is 7 x 7); you must make your way to the goal 
while avoiding any members of the OOPS FIVE that stand in your way.  
You're allowed to move one space each turn; after your turn is over, 
the OOPS FIVE members move.  However, each OOPS FIVE member has a 
specific movement pattern.  For example, Silk Sil Vous Plait (the huge 
slobbering mouth), has the same movement pattern that you do (if you 
move up, Silk will move up; if you move down, Silk will move down).  
Denbu (the pink flying butt), on the other hand, moves the _opposite_ 
way (if you move up one space, Denbu will move down one space).  If, at 
any time, an OOPS FIVE member ends up occupying the same space as you, 
the game is over (you'll become "Engachoed").  To make things a bit 
more difficult, you must complete each puzzle within a certain number 
of steps.  If you overstep, you'll lose as well.  There are also "boss" 
battles if which you fight your father.  These battles invariably take 
place on a 7 x 7 map scattered with OOPS FIVE members; the goal of the 
boss battles is (what else?) to get your father "Engachoed".

Though the game's concept is definitely left of center, Engacho! is 
surprisingly quite fun as a game; it's very challenging and is 
extremely addicting to a fault.  And, the character designs are quite 
appealing as well...in a...disgusting sort of way (they're done by 
Uruma Delvi; if you've ever seen that old twisted Japanese children 
show "Ugo Ugo Luga" the artwork may seem familiar).  

A Playstation version of Engacho! was released as well; it plays the 
same as the Wonderswan version, but with different stages.  However, 
this FAQ focuses solely on the Wonderswan release.

The "OOPS FIVE"
---------------

1. SILK SIL VOUS PLAIT

   Appearance: 
   Looks like a pear with a huge mouth, a humongous slobbering tongue,
   and a Mickey Mouse hat.

   Attack method: 
   Covers you with slobber.

2. SPICY

   Appearance: 
   Looks like a wrestler with an extraordinarily hairy armpit.

   Attack method: 
   Forces his armpit into your face, exposing you to its stench.

3. HANABISHIN

   Appearance:
   The large nose that's wearing a graduation cap.

   Attack method:
   Throws a huge snot rocket at you.

4. DENBU

   Appearance:
   A huge pink flying butt with wings.

   Attack method:
   Sh*ts all over you.

5. FANCY

   Appearance:
   A large sack tied up with a pink ribbon.  Forms only when 2 OOPS
   FIVE members (Silk and Denbu, or Spicy and Hanabishin) collide into
   the same space.

   Attack method:
   Fancy doesn't attack per se, but you can get trapped inside the bag
   if two other OOPS FIVE members collide in your space.

   \|/                              \|/     

As you could see, Silk moves the same as you do, Denbu moves in the 
opposite direction, and as you move, Spicy and Hanabishin move to your 
left and right, respectively.  Fancy doesn't move at all. 

---------
GAME OVER
---------

You'll lose the game if you do any of these things:

-Occupy the same space as an OOPS FIVE member.  If this happens,
 you'll get "Engachoed"!
-Overstep: This occurs when you exceed the maximum amount of steps
 required to solve the current puzzle.
-Getting trapped: This happens when you're surrounded on all four sides
 and can't move.

---------------
DIFFERENT MODES
---------------

1. TRAINING MODE

   This is a series of simple puzzles designed to give you practice.
   You're allowed to choose which member of the OOPS FIVE to challenge;
   each member has 10 different stages, making a total of 50 stages 
   available in this mode.  Before each stage, you're given a clue 
   to help you make your way to the goal.

2. PUZZLE MODE

   There are five different rooms in the puzzle mode: 
   -Gakumon no Ma (Learning Room)
   -Taiiku no Ma (Physical Training Room)
   -Kyuushoku no Ma (Suspension Room)
   -Ongaku no Ma (Concert Room)
   -Saigo no Ma (Last Room)

   Each room is divided into 20 stages (there are therefore 100 stages
   total in the Puzzle Mode).  Ihe final stage in each room is
   a boss battle against your father.

3. VS. COM MODE

   These are 100 stages, divided into 5 rooms.  Each stage is similar
   to the boss battles of the puzzle mode, in which you fight against
   your father. 

4. BATTLE MODE

   This is similar to the Vs. COM mode, only in the Battle Mode you 
   fight against a second player via the Wonderswan link cable.  There
   are 100 different stages in the battle mode.

There's also a special fifth mode, that opens up later in the game.  
I'll include more info about this in a future update.

That's it for now.  More puzzle solutions to come soon.  If you have 
any puzzle solutions that are better than those listed above (solutions 
that require less steps, for example), let me know and I'll include 
them.

I may write a few other WonderSwan/WonderSwan Color game FAQs in the 
future if this one goes well; the WS is currently my favorite handheld 
and I own about 40 games for it.  Plus, information on WS games (in 
English at least) is quite piddling at the moment if you ask me...
