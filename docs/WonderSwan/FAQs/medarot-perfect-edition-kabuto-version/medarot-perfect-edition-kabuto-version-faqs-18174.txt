
			MEDAROT: PERFECT EDITION KABUTO VERSION
 				      for WONDERSWAN
					  Version 0.1




This walkthrough was made by me because of the fact that there were no
walkthroughs avalible at the time.  It is also so far only used for the Kabuto
version of the game.  If anyone could tell me if both versions of the game are
the same, it would really be appreciated.  I started this walkthrough all by
myself and I would appreciate any help to complete this, and I will give credit
to those who help.

          II. UPDATES
----------------------------
Version 0.1-  This is the first version of the walkthrough.  I just submitted
it to Gamefaqs and I'm waiting to hear back from them.  All I have done is the
first half of the walkthrough and a few parts of the medals.  The only problem
is that I can't read japanese, therefore I need a lot of help.

----------------------------
      III. WALKTHROUGH
----------------------------
A note about the walkthrough-Go to the 24 store whenever you want as long as
the walkthrough tells you not to.  This is a cool place to get Meda-Parts for
you Bots.

------------------
YOUR FIRST MEDABOT
------------------
     After the mini-conversation, go downstairs.  When you attempt to leave,
another conversation starts between you and your mom.  Apparently you have to
take the family pet for a walk so walk outside and go right till you get to the
next screen, which is the park.
     Walk over to your dog and throw a stick for him to chase(It does the
"stick" thing by itself) and the stick will end up hitting a member of the
Rubber Robo Gang.  Your dog ends up scaring away the guy and then you get
control of your character again.  Walk right until you find your dog.  Next to
the dog you find a medal on the ground.  Walk back to your house and attempt to
go up to your room.  Your dad then gives you your first Medabot!  Well, there
is nothing else to do right now except to go to school.

--------------------
YOUR FIRST ROBATTLES
--------------------
     Walk around town until you find the big building with a clock on it.  Walk
inside and a conversation starts between you and a girl.  Follow her upstairs
and the conversation starts again.  Now you follow her into the classroom and
listen to the teacher's conversation to the class.  After the teacher is
finished talking and leaves the classroom, walk out of the school and go all
the way right back into the park.  Here you will find the girl that showed you
the way to the classroom(supposedly she is a friend of yours) and then you will
be engaged into you first robattle.  This one is pretty easyall of the attacks
you currently have are pretty strong.  the attacks are as follows:
     Up:     Missles (only can be used four times)
     Left:   Three Bullets(unlimited times)
     Right:  One Big Bullet(unlimited times)
After winning the first battle, you are engaged into another(don't worry about
having low HP because it is fully healed from one battle to another)  This one
is about as easy as the first one but as far as I know, it is no big deal if
you lose this battle, but I would try to win.  After this battle, another place
is open for exploring, the shore.

---------
THE SHORE
---------
     The shore is south of the town where you live.  The shore is currently
being terrorized by the Rubber Robo Gang, and it is your job to take out the
trash.  Whatever you do, don't enter the 24 shop until the walkthrough says
otherwise, or else you will get into a Robattle which at this point you most
likely lose.  Go south and the left to find a little cave, and before you
enter, you will Robattle a member of the Rubber Robo Gang, which should be
another easy battle.  Enter the cave and find your way through it, inspecting
each of the crates as you go.  Towards the end of the cave, you will find a
crate with a frame to a Medabot inside.  You also get a medal I think but I am
not really sure.  Assemble another Medabot anyway you can with spare parts. 
This will be useful for defeating the next member of the Rubber Robo Gang. 
Exit the cave.
     When you leave the cave and try to walk away, you will be challenged to a
Robattle by another member of the Rubber Robo Gang.  This battle should be
fairly easy if you have a second Medabot, like I said.  You now can enter the
24 store and not get attacked by the Rubber Robo Member.  Talk to the guy by
the shore to get three free Medaparts.  Then go up one screen.

------------------
YOUR THIRD MEDABOT
------------------
     Now attempt to go left one screen and you will be engaged by another
Robattle.  After you win, follow the guy you beat left.  When you get here, you
find that the Rubber Robos are here also.  Go and talk to the member of the
gang and beat him in a Robattle.  After the battle, keep going up until you get
to a screen with a pond on it.  The one guy closest to the top is the guy you
want to talk to.  He is a Rubber Robo Member.  When you battle and beat him,  I
know that you get a medal but I'm not sure which one.  Then continue to go back
down screens until you are at the screen that were at before you went to the
pond.  Then go left, Robattling the person on the way.  On the next screen,
your friend from the beginning of the game finds you and you get a medal, I
think.  Go left once again, and enter the big building in the middle.  Inside
of here, talk to everyone to get things like Medaparts, and even another
Medabot frame.

MORE OF THE WALKTHROUGH WILL COME SOON.
