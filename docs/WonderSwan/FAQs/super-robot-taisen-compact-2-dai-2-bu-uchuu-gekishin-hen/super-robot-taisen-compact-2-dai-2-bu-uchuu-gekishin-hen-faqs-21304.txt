PROFILE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This section is not related to the game itself. I added it in, only because
this is my first faq/walkthrough I wrote. On my next faq/walkthrough, this
section will be removed.

FACTS:
-This is my first faq/walkthrough.
-I am not Japanese. (sorry about the translations, I'm trying my best.)
-I am studying Japanese though, but learning 2 languages at the same time is
very hard. Since Mandarin and Japanese Kanji have different pronounciations.

BEGIN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Once you begin the game, you would notice that the main character is a girl,
if you have played the first volume of Super Robot Taisen Compact 2, you would
notice that she is the main character's girlfriend.

	On this screen, you can edit names for the main character and her
boyfriend(the main character of last volume).

PROLOGUE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	In space on the year of 200XX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WALKTHROUGH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	There will be a dialogue of two mysterious people, followed by Bright and his
crew's dialogue. For those if don't know the old man with glasses that had
talked in the dialogue, is actually the pilot of the Guzzard, a cool Dragon
mecha ship. Since the main character names are long, I will call them MC and
MC2.
