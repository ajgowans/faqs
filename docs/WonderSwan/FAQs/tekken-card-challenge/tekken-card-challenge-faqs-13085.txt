I.    Introduction and Version History

I've owned this game almost since it came out, but I never really understood
what was going on until I sat down and started translating the Japanese.  Now I
know, and I can truly say that this title is just way too random to be much
fun.  It's enjoyable for a little while, but there's just no way to control
what's going on most of the time...  Ah well, what did you expect for a Tekken
offshoot?

Version 0.80 (7/23/01): Missing 4 card values, 5 character strategies, True
Ogre's card names.
Version 0.50 (7/22/01): First public release, all card lists full, missing 5
card values.

III.  Card Battle Mechanics

A card battle is a one-on-one battle between two characters.  Each character
starts with four cards, and selects one (or more, depending on certain
situations) of those cards to play against the opponent each turn.  The cards
are cycled through quickly in a roulette, making it very difficult to select
the intended card.  When playing against the computer, cards are always
selected randomly.

Each round, each player selects a card from the roulette, and the cards are
played against one another.  All main characters start with 100 hit points
(Tekken Forces characters always have fewer), and the battle ends when one
player is knocked out with 0 hit points remaining.

There are four types of cards available to every player:
  Guard Card:  Always card 01 with a point value of 00, this will guard against
both single and multiple attacks (except unblockable attacks).
  Attack Cards: Cards 02-10 (and sometimes 11 or 12, depending on the
character) with attack values ranging from 10 to 95.  Many cards have marks,
which add or remove certain features from cards.
  Block Cards:  Cards 11 and/or 12, depending on the character, acts like a
guard card but always with a bonus mark.
  Combo Cards:  Cards 13 through 15, which give the character 2, 3, and 4-hit
combos against the opponent.  Considered standard Attack cards for point value
purposes.  Not available in 1- or 2-player battles. See Adventure Game
Mechanics for more detail.

When two attack cards are played, the point values from each card are compared
against one another.  If one attack card has a higher value than the other,
then that card wins and the opponent is damaged for the point value on the
card.  The losing card is discarded from the loser's deck, and the winning card
is shuffled back into the winner's deck.

When an Attack card is played against a Guard or Block card, neither side
sustains damage, and both cards are discarded.  Exceptions are when a Block
card contains a Counter mark (the attacker takes damage) or the Attack card is
unblockable (Attack wins and is re-shuffled).

When two Guard or Block cards are played against one another, neither side
takes damage, and both cards are discarded from the deck.

IV.   Adventure Game Mechanics

Selecting Characters
--------------------
The first time you play the game, you will be given the choice of three
starting characters.  The first two are always Jin and Xiaoyu, but the third is
dependant on the Sex and Blood Type you entered in the personalization menu on
your WonderSwan: (If you've never played with the menu, simply hold the Start
button while powering on your WS.)

Sex   Blood      Character
--------------------------
 ?      ?        Hwoarang
 M      ?/A/AB   Hwoarang
 M      A        Lei
 M      B        Eddy
 M      O        Paul
 F      Any      Nina

After you've selected the starting character, subsequent returns to the
character select screen will present you with a 21-character menu from which
you can select any unlocked character.  Additionally, if you press the Y4
button while over a character, you will be given the option to re-intialize
that character's data.  Otherwise, simply press A to select the character and
enter the game.

Controls
--------
The X-Buttons are used to move your character around the stage.  The A-Button
is used to engage enemy characters.  The B-Button displays an explanation of
the Y-Button, and is used to exit Y-Button menus.

The Y-Buttons are used primarily in deck management:
 Y1: Deck Change - View cards, set up your hand for the next battle.  X to
move, A to select, B to cancel/exit, Y4 to view descriptions.
 Y2: Combo Change - Change your combo card setup.  X to move, A to select, B to
cancel/exit, Y4 to view descriptions.
 Y3: Card View - X1 and X3 to cycle through cards, B to exit.
 Y4: Exchange - Upgrade 10 unused cards to the next higher level card.  X to
move, A to select, B to cancel/exit, Y4 to view descriptions.

To reset the game at any point, press A + B + Start.

The Adventure Field
-------------------
Each stage of the Adventure game takes place on a 15X15 square field.  Your
character has 60 "steps" in which to traverse the field and make it to the
exit.  The starting point is always on the leftmost column of the field, and
the ending point is always on the rightmost column.  Warning sirens will sound
at 20 and 10 steps remaining, and if you run out of steps, the "TIME UP" screen
appears and the stage ends.

On each Adventure Field, you will find the following elements:
 - Plain Tiles: On which you can walk
 - Block Tiles: Trees, buildings, and mountains through which you can't pass
 - Kurukuru Cards: Extra cards for your deck - Walk over to pick them up
 - Temples: Two buildings that restore full health and grant cards and levels
 - Pits: Black holes that damage your character for a random point total.
 - Tekken Forces: Three or four low-level characters (Crow, Falcon, Hawk, and
Owl) who are looking to battle you.
 - Rival: One of three rivals for your character; an even match.
 - Entry/Exit Buildings: Your start and end points on each stage.

At the bottom of the screen are five figures:
 - Your character's HP (Maximum of 100, 50 for Crow)
 - Your character's Level (Maximum of 9)
 - Your characters Card Points (Maximum of 99)
 - Steps Remaining (Starts at 60, TIME UP at 0)
 - Current Stage Number (Maximum of 99)

As you move around, one square in each direction is revealed to you.  Temples,
Entry/Exit Buildings, and some (but not all) Block Tiles are visible from a
distance, but everything else is invisible.  There is also an arrow on top of
your character, which always points to the nearest Tekken Force, Rival or
Temple.

Your main objective on each stage is to make it to the Exit Building before you
run out of steps, collecting as many cards along the way as possible.  If you
run out of time or are defeated in battle, the game ends, returning you to the
menu.  Additionally, you will lose one of each card you have in your deck
(leaving a minimum of 2 cards of any one type).

Card Battles take place when you encounter enemy characters.  Battles will
commence if you run into an enemy who was hidden, if enemies surround you from
the rear and both sides, or if you are facing an enemy and press A.  If a
battle begins automatically, you will only face that one enemy, but if you are
directly next to multiple enemies and press the A button, you will engage all
enemies one after another with no break in between.

If you defeat a Rival, there seems to be a random chance that the Rival will be
unlocked in the character selection screen.  There is no pattern to the
unlocks, although getting a Perfect against the Rival seems to increase the
chances.

Once your character reaches Level 9 (not Stage 9), the next stage and all
following stages will turn into "Ogre World".  There are no Rivals in Ogre
World stages, but in their place is the Ogre Tower, in which Ogre resides. 
When you beat Ogre, the game ends, although you can re-enter the game for that
character afterwards, and the world will return to normal.

Enemies
-------
On each stage are up to four enemies, one of which can be a Rival character.
The most common enemy are the Tekken Forces, represented by four characters
from Tekken 3's Tekken Force mode:
  Crow: 50 Hit Points
  Falcon: 60 Hit Points
  Hawk: 70 Hit Points
  Owl: 80 Hit Points

The chances of meeting the tougher Tekken Forces depends on your character's
level, not the stage number.  You likely won't see anyone but Crow for the
first few levels, and then you'll notice Falcon and Hawk appear between levels
4 and 6.  At level 9, all four characters will appear randomly.  The Tekken
Forces always are at the same card level as your character, so see Crow's card
list below to get an idea of what to expect.

Your rivals are also at your card level, and always have 100 hit points.  Only
one of your three rivals will appear on any stage, so once you've met them, you
only have to worry about Tekken Forces.

Once you reach level 9, the Ogre Tower will appear on each stage field.  Ogre
is naturally at Level 9, and once he is defeated, he is replaced by True Ogre. 
True Ogre has 200 Hit Points, but is a Level 1 character with only four cards
to choose from.  One of them is an unblockable 50-point attack, but the others
are standard attack cards from 20 to 40 points.  True Ogre cannot block, but he
cannot be juggled either.

Gaining Cards and Levels
------------------------
As you progress through each Adventure Stage, you will gain cards and card
points from either battles or picking up Kurukuru cards on the ground.  You
will only gain and find cards that are within your current card level, so it is
important to raise your card level.

Defeating a Tekken Force character will win you one card and one Card Point.
Defeating a Rival will win you two cards and two points, but getting a Perfect
(taking no damage, regardless of your starting HP) will win three cards and
points.  As you might expect, picking up a Kurukuru card nets you a single card
and point for each one you find.

Every 10 card points you gain, you are eligible to move up one level.  Simply
enter a Temple, and you will gain a new card to match your new character level.
 Once you have reached level 9, no new levels are gained, but you will receive
one random card.

Each character has 15 cards associated with them.  Cards 2 through 5 are
granted at the beginning of the game, and another 8 cards are received at each
Level Up.  The remaining three cards are Combo Cards, which can be gained at
the completion of the 5th, 10th, and 15th stages if the following requirements
are met:
  2-Ren Combo:  Card Level 4 (Stage 5, 10, or 15)
  3-Ren Combo:  Card Level 7 (Stage 10 or 15, must have 2-Ren)
  4-Ren Combo:  Card Level 9 (Stage 15, must have 2-Ren and 3-Ren)

If you miss gaining a Combo Card at the end of a stage, you will not be able to
get that card for that character.  This makes it vitally important to get to
the required card levels for each of the three stages, as the Combo cards are
very useful.

Deck Management
---------------
At any point on the Adventure Field you can stop and manage your deck by
pressing one of the Y buttons.

Deck Change: Y1 Button
The Deck Change allows you to set up your hand (i.e. your first four cards) for
the next battle.  You can place up to two of any card in your hand.  In the
card list, you will see two numbers to the right of each card.  The first shows
how many cards are available to use in your hand (Max 2) and the second shows
the number of remaining cards in your deck (Max 15).

Combo Change: Y2 Button
The Combo Change allows you to set up your Combo Cards.  Each of the three
combo cards allows you to put in-deck cards in a combo (as if played serially).
 The total point count of the cards you use in your combo cannot exceed the
point count of the combo card, but it does not have to match it.  In a Combo,
you can only use Attack Cards, the Serial mark is not effective, and only the
first card in the combo is affected by preceeding marks (such as the Style
card).

Exchange: Y4 Button
The Exchange allows you to trade 10 of any card in your deck for the next
higher level card.  You can only carry a maximum of 15 cards of any one type in
your hand, and the Level 9 card cannot be traded up.

=============================================================================

V.    Card Marks

Upper Arrow     /^  Juggle      浮かし
  When a juggle card is used to attack successfully, the opponent becomes
airborne, and the attacker is given a free play for the next round.  Multiple
juggles can be played one after another, chaining several free hits together.

Double Arrow    >>  Serial      連続
  A serial card starts a "combo" of sorts, allowing the attacker to select
another card to follow the first attack, and the damage total of all chained
cards is used in the attack.  Selecting an already-selected card or a
non-attack card ends the chain and begins the attack.  Multiple Serial cards
can be chained together one-after-another, and the sum-total damage of all
cards is used in the attack.

Double Line     //  Block       さばき
  A Block card blocks any incoming attack, nullifying its damage. 
Additionally, if a block successfully stops an attack, one random card from the
attacker is removed from the roulette for the next round only.

Turning Arrow   />  Counter     返し
  A Counter card takes any attack thrown against the character and counters it
back against the attacker.  Counter damage cannot KO an opponent, but it will
reduce their health down to 5 points.  Counter cards take precedence over an
unblockable card.

"K"             K   Style       かまえ
  After a Style card has been successfully played (an attack card hits or a
defense card blocks), certain attacks will hit for double damage.  The card's
point value does not increase, but the damage done on a successful hit will be
raised.  All characters with Style cards except Law and Hwoarang also have
corresponding Diaya cards that will double the attack power.  For Law and
Hwoarang, on the next turn, an attack card will play as a Serial card.

Exclamations    !!  Self-Damage 自分もダメージ
  A Self-Damage card damages the attacker as much as the defender by the same
damage point count if it is successful.  Self-Damage cannot KO the attacker,
but it can reduce the health all the way down to 5 points.

Triangle        |\  Disconnect  外れることあり
  A Disconnect card attack will be dodged if it immediately follows a
successful attack.

Diamond         *   Daiya       ダイヤ
  Diaya cards have special properties, depending on the specific card.  The
Daiya cards are marked in the card list below as follows:
     *S = 2X Attack when played after Style かまえから、こうげき力UP
     *G = Unblockable Attack                ガードもさばきもできない
     *H = HP Steal Attack                   HPをかいふく
     *R = Style card plays as a Series      かまえなられんぞくルーレット

VII.  Adventure Game Strategy

General Strategy
----------------
*  It's always better to Reset than lose a battle.  Since you can always tell
if your opponent is going to be able to knock you out on the next card, hitting
reset will save you the loss of your cards and allow you to try the level over.
*  If you cannot make the required levels to get the combo cards on stages 5,
10, or 15, it's best to take the TIME UP and loss of cards rather than losing
the chance to get those combo cards.  You only have one shot at them, and
losing the cards due to a TIME UP does not decrease your Card Point total or
your Card Level.
*  One cheap way to get ahead in the game is to replay stage 1 over and over,
collecting cards, avoiding battle, and not leveling up.  You can gain up to 99
card points without leveling up, which will allow you to play through levels
without having to worry about collecting Card Point to get those elusive Combo
Cards.
*  Don't be in such a rush that you hit a pit.  Look where you're stepping.
*  One good strategy in a level is to immediately head for the exit, then step
back and look for cards and easily-winnable battles until time grows short.
*  When preparing to meet Ogre, make your way to the exit in Ogre World, then
stop and set up your combo cards and your hand before leaving the stage.  Your
setup is saved at the end of each stage, so you'll be ready to face Ogre time
and time again with your preferred setup if need be.
*  Against Ogre, the best card setup is generally one counter card (if you have
one) and three of your highest attack cards or serial cards if you have them.

Character Strategy: Law
-----------------------
When playing as Law, live for those Serial attacks.  Law is powerful early on
thanks to the DKC and TRB, and once he gains the Fake Step at Level 5, any card
can become a Serial starter.  The four Juggling cards work great at the end of
combos or serials, making Law a fairly easy play.

Character Strategy: Ogre
------------------------
The second-tougest charcter in the game, Ogre comes into his own at Level 5
with the Zangetsu, a 50-point Serial card.  You can make short work of any
opponent without a second thought, and the 90-point unblockable Seiranken is
just nasty at Level 9.  Ogre is unstoppable for the most part, making his
Adventure game a breeze.

Character Strategy: Kuma
------------------------
Kuma looks powerful, but is actually very hard to play.  Almost every one of
his powerful attacks will miss every other turn, and he's only got one
after-Style card to use.

Playing as Kuma relies on getting the first attack in and in hard.  If it's
blocked, you could be in trouble.  Keep those high attack cards in your hand,
but remember that they'll fail every other time they hit.  Against Ogre, go for
the one bit hit to start and try to win out against his other cards as they
come.

Character Strategy: Mokujin
---------------------------
Mokujin is very weak, has no serial cards, and lacks any redeeming values
whatsoever.  Second weakest in the game, you'll want to concentrate the
majority of your time avoiding combat and counting on your Combo cards to save
you at the very end.  Even the Level 9 Mokujin Fang is a bit of a joke, only
dealing 50 points of unblockable damage.

When going against Ogre, live off of your Combo cards, and keep the Kaeshi
handy in case he throws his 90-pointer at you.  Luck is the only way to survive
against him and True Ogre, so be prepared to do a lot of resetting.

Character Strategy: Julia
-------------------------
Julia is a horribly weak character with no redeeming values...until Level 9, at
which point she becomes a powerhouse.  The Shippohouchuu is an unbelievable
70-point Serial card, which will decimate anything in its way.  Two of them,
another high point card, and a Counter will ensure quick defeat of anyone in
your way, including True Ogre, who can actually be killed in one turn.

Character Strategy: Panda
-------------------------
Panda's attacks are weaker than Kuma's, but he doesn't suffer from the dreaded
black triangle syndrome.  With no serial cards and only a weak juggle, playing
as Panda means hitting hard and fast.  The Style card has two corresponding
follow-up attacks for big damage, which can be useful against rivals or Ogre.

The best strategy here is to hold off leveling up as long as possible, in order
to take full advantage of your early edge against the Tekken Force and your
rivals.  Meeting Ogre can be scary, and most battles will turn into a war of
luck.

Character Strategy: Paul
------------------------
Paul plays like Panda with a couple of extra juggles in there.  Hit hard, hit
fast, and cross your fingers that your Rival or Ogre don't go Serial on you. 
Paul simply does not stand up to Law, Jin, or Ogre very well, so be prepared to
Reset the game on a bad draw (i.e. fairly often).

Character Strategy: Xiaoyu
--------------------------
With three serial cards, two setup attacks, and a 45-point juggle, Xiaoyu is
best powered up as quickly as possible.  You should be able to readily handle
anything any other character throws at you with your serials, making Xiaoyu a
great starter character.

Character Strategy: Yoshimitsu
------------------------------
Yoshi is a bit of an enigma.  Strong early, weak late, and a danger to himself
with a 65-point self-damage card.  The 50-point Sengaku is his most useful
card, stealing HP back from the enemy.  With this, he's able to hold his own
against most everyone, as long as the draws are lucky.

Character Strategy: Nina
------------------------
Serial, serial, serial, serial.  Nina cannot be stopped early or late in the
game.  One of only four characters that can kill a rival in one turn at Level
1, she's best when stringing one attack after another, obviously.  Your rivals
should fall fairly easily, and even Ogre shouldn't prove too much trouble with
the proper setup (Shoukaku X 2, 4-Ren Combo, Kaeshi to counter).

Character Strategy: Heihachi
----------------------------
As in Tekken 3 itself, Heihachi is Power.  From Level 1 (100 point damage
Serial possible) to Level 9 (a 90-point card w/Setup bonus), it's just hard to
lose when playing as Heihachi.  Add in two massively powerful Juggle cards (60
and 70 points), Adventure mode is a stroll in the park.

Character Strategy: King
------------------------
King is unlike any other character in the game in that he's maxed out from the
beginning.  His 50-point Leg Lariat is his most powerful card (not counting the
Combos), and after Level 2, he actually gets weaker on average by gaining only
cards with lower point values.  Of course, at level 2, he becomes godlike with
the 45-point Serial card, Back Drop.  From there, he remains unstoppable for
the rest of the game.

It's actually best to take out the rivals earlier in the game.  Save up cards
and only level up at the last possible moment in order to maximize your unfair
advantage over everyone else.  By Level 9, the playing field is just a little
more even, but it's still possible to overpower anyone else.  Two Back Drops
give you 90, and your third attack is completely up to you against the Tekken
Forces, Rivals, or Ogre.

Character Strategy: Lei
-----------------------
Lei looks weak until level 4, where he picks up the Tsuru no Kamae.  A
Counter/Setup card, it's Lei's best defense and offense in the game, allowing
him to take out any opponent fairly quickly.  Don't forget to set up your combo
cards to lead with the Hyousousou or Choukakurengeki, and you're set for the
whole game, including Ogre.

Character Strategy: Jin
-----------------------
Jin's strength lies in a combination of Juggle and Setup, but that alone
doesn't push him to the next level.  Fairly weak when his opponents aren't in
mid-air, it's best to avoid combat after Level 3, as you'll quickly find
yourself overmatched against your three serial-throwing rivals.

Against Ogre and True Ogre, there's no way to easily win except with luck. 
Cross your fingers, keep the Kaeshi on standby, and good luck.

Character Strategy: Hwoarang
----------------------------


Character Strategy: Doctor B.
-----------------------------


Character Strategy: Bryan
-------------------------


Character Strategy: Crow
------------------------
Let's face it; Crow sucks.  With only 50 HP, you've only got half as much
health as any other character.  There's only one real strategy here: AVOID ALL
COMBAT.  From levels 1 through 7, Crow is absolutely helpless.  He's as weak or
weaker than any other character, and the three rivals the game sticks you with
are all absolutely lethal.  At Level 8, you get half a chance with the Nakama o
Yobu card, which doubles the damage (but not the point value) of your next
attack.

When you get down to it, there's only one real battle you'll be wanting to
fight here.  When facing Ogre, first set up your Combo cards with the most
powerful attacks coming first (i.e. for the 4-hit card, Fuujinken and then
three Ginsenkas).  Set up your hand with two Nakama cards, your 3-Hit combo,
and your 4-hit combo.  Then get your trigger finger ready.  Against Ogre
(assuming he doesn't throw the unblockable 90-point Seiranken at you), Nakama,
then either combo card to finish him in two moves.  Against True Ogre, repeat
with the other combo card (assuming he doesn't breathe fire), and try to win
the war of attrition.

Good luck.  You'll need it.

Character Strategy: Gun Jack
----------------------------


Character Strategy: Anna
------------------------


Character Strategy: Eddy
------------------------
The most powerful character in the game, to the point of being extremely cheap.
 You start the game with a 40-point Serial, and end it with a 65-point Serial. 
Nasty.  Eddy is one of two characters that can take out Rivals at Level 1 and
True Ogre at Level 9 in one round.  Use the serial cards religiously, and never
look back.
