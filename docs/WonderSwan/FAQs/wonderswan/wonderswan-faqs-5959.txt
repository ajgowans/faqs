1.0) Just these few words...
----------------------------

Hi there Readers, thanks for reading the Wonder Swan FAQ. By writing
this FAQ, i am hoping that Bandai (and Mattel) will see that North 
Americans and Europeans want to get the Wonder Swan (and all the 
games & accessories) at their local video game store.

With the rumors that "MAYBE" Mattel will sell the Wonder Swan here 
in North America, this is a good step to finally see the Wonder Swan 
available elsewhere than in Japan.

There is a Petition list for getting the Wonder Swan available in 
the U.S.A. at this web adress: 

http://www.theguestbook.com/egbook/107535.gbook

And if there are a kind soul that wants to make a Petition list in 
Europe, please me know and i'll include the link in this FAQ.

So if anyone wants to see the Wonder Swan, i invite you to please go 
sign the Petition list, if not for you then do it for the other video 
gamers like me. Thanks in advanced !

** Update ** 

Rumors is that Bandai and Mattel did sign together to release the 
Wonder Swan here in North America by the end of this year!! YEAH!!
Bernie Stolar, the guy responsible for the Dreamcast lauch and 
worked for Sony for the Playstation and other things that Sega Saturn
fans know too well (that's another story...) sign on with Mattel for
the launch of the Wonder Swan.

Other rumors is that the Wonder Swan could be in COLOR instead of
being in Black & White since Bandai will released the Color version
at the end of this year. (see section "2.5" for more details)

With the recent news that SNK has pulled-out the Neo-Geo Pocket Color
from the North American, European and China markets, this will surely
aid the Wonder Swan to get a move-on.  

====================================================================

2.0) The Bandai Wonder Swan
---------------------------

Released the forth of March 1999, the Wonder Swan is the latest 
Hand-Held Game System released by Bandai. This newcommer is a 16-bit 
system that displays in Black and White comes in different colors. 
Choices range from : 

 Original Color:
 --------------- 
 * Pearl White         * Skeleton Green 
 * Silver Metallic     * Skeleton Red/Pink
 * Blue Metallic       * Skeleton Blue

 Summer Two-Tone Color:
 ---------------------- 
 * Frozen Mint
 * Sherbet Melon
 * Soda Blue

Bandai has released some few Special Edition Packages and Gift Sets.
Each packages or sets comes with a game and a Wonder Swan in a new 
color casing. Here's the list of the Special Edition Packages:

* Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeons 
* Digimon Adventure
* Mobile Suit Gundam MSVS: Earth Federation
* Mobile Suit Gundam MSVS: Zeon 
* Tarepan Gunpey (Tarepan WS)

And here's the list of the Special Edition Gift Sets:

* Gunpey (blue skeleton WS)
* Klonoa (blue skeleton WS)
* Digimon (orange skeleton WS)
* SD Gundam: Emotional Jam (blue skeleton WS)

Also Bandai had announced a Wonder Swan with a backlit light but
for now, i don't know if it was released or not. The only information
i have found on this backlit edition is how to make your own on some
few personnal japanese web site. Anyboby has information about this ?

The most unique feature about Wonder Swan is that it can be played 
both horizontally and vertically depends on the game you are playing.
It has a built-in speaker, sound button, start button, A & B button,
contrast-volume button and two directions pads buttons. As now the 
Wonder Swan is the smallest handheld game system and takes only one 
AA battery to make it work for about 30 to 40 hours.

The rectangular screen is relatively large, being almost as wide as 
Game Boy's, but not as tall. The monochrome screen has 8 shades and 
provides decent graphic quality even for fine text. The absence of 
backlighting, however, means that the unit is suitable for use only 
in well lit places. 

The unit can be used horizontally or vertically depending on the game. 
Laid horizontal, the left thumb controls the direction pad while the 
right thumb is used for manipulating two pushbuttons, much like Game 
Boy, Game Gear and Neo Geo Pocket. Held vertically, the player controls 
two direction pads in a style similar to PlayStation's analog controller 
pads. Wonder Swan also features a port for accepting a link cable and a 
slot for connecting yet-unannounced peripheral devices. In addition to 
a standard AA battery, WS can also be operated on a dedicated, slim, 
long life rechargeable battery.

====================================================================

5.1) The Wonder Gate:
---------------------
Bandai announced On June 23, a communication adapter and cartridge 
for the Wonder Swan. This peripheral is inserted into the cartridge 
port for connecting to a cellular telephone. This item will transform 
the Wonder Swan into a network terminal. This acessory should be 
available by the end of this year. With Nintendo choosing to announce 
a similar network connectable setup, it appears the two major handheld 
systems are going to slug it out over the network.

Beside Wonder Gate, Bandai announced it will undertake the development 
of original network contents including games that will work with the
communication adapter. The market waits with baited breath to see how 
Bandai's announcement will affect Nintendo's plans with the communicable 
Game Boy. 

One of the first game to support the Wonder Gate was launched on December 
1999, it was SD Gundam: Episode 1. It would be able to use the Wonder Gate 
to perform downloads from Bandai's website.


Specs of the Wonder Gate:
-------------------------
Power: One AAA battery
Communication protocols: PDC digital cell phone communication protocol
                         PPP and TCP/IP Internet connection protocol.
Dimensions: 70 x 40 x 23 mm (HWD; provisional; the width would be 30mm
            when connected to WonderSwan)

Communication Cartridge:
1) Browser (HTML 3.2)
2) Mailer (Memory stores up to 50 mail addresses and 100 messages of up 
   to 300 ascii text code. Also supports HTML mail, attached image files, 
   etc)
3) Downloading of (32kb) minigames (designed for automatic line shutoff 
   to allow play)

====================================================================

5.2) The Wonder Wave:
---------------------

At the Tokyo Game Show of September 1999, Bandai unveiled the Wonder 
Wave, a device that allows remote linking between the Wonder Swan and 
and the Playstation 2 via the Pocket Station.

It uses an infrared light to send data to the Pocket Station, which has 
similar abilities. The Wonder Wave clips onto the right side of the 
Wonder Swan. While character and game data can be transferred between 
the two, another possibility is that the two units can share Pocket 
Station mini game data to play against one another. Bandai said this is 
possible, but went no further in explaining this killer possibility. 

Anyone has more informations ?

====================================================================

5.3) The Wonder Borg:
---------------------
This is mostly one of the unique peripherals i have ever seen. it
is a little robot that you can program to learn about early robotic
enginering. It has infra-red rays sensors, touch sensors, floor
sensors, brightness sensors, pheromane sensors, step sensors and
interlock sensors. Thse little robots are mainly for education and
entertainment like for battle with other Borgs.

====================================================================

5.4) The Wonder Witch:
----------------------
The Wonder Witch is basically a developper's tool for making your
own games or software on the Wonder Swan. The language use to program
is the C language, one of the easiest to learn. The source code of the
program is made for PC with an text editor, afterwhich you take your
source code and compile it with a C compiler to make a exucutable 
program to upload in your Wonder Swan. But here's the catch of this
gadget: You must know Japanese to use it.

But if you do know Japanese, here's the requirement you'll need to use
the Wonder Witch:

* A Wonder Swan (DUH!!)
* The Wonder Witch kit which contains:
  - One PC-Wonder Swan connection cable (RS232C serial connection)
  - Swan cable: One Swan connector < -> DSUB9 (male)
  - One cartridge (OS and Font building built-in) only for Wonder Witch
    Flash ROM: 512KB(4Mbit). The program file of 384KB or less's worth 
    can be stored. 
    SRAM: 256KB(2Mbit). 64KB or less's worth of a work file can be stored. 
    RTC (clock/calender function)
    Original OS(FreyaOS). Version up is possible. 
    Japanese font, 8x8 dot, the 1st/the second level)
  - One CD-ROM (software)
    File transfer tool (XMODEM protocol for Windows)
    Library filed C header
    Sample source
    Appendix C compiler (for Turbo C2.0 and LSI C-86 for Wonder Witch 
    and Windows)
  - Online manual.
  - One manual.

* And a PC:
  - PC/AT compatible
  - Display resolution: More than 256 colors <640x480 dots>
  - OS: Windows 98, NT4.0, 2000
  - CD ROM drive
  - CPU: Pentium 133MHz or more
  - Serial port: RS232 C9600/38400 bps (DSUB-9 male connector)
  - Memory: 32MB or more (recommendation 64MB or more)
  - HDD empty capacity: 20MB or more

And the support Web Site: "http://wonderwitch.qute.co.jp/"

There is a FAQ about the Wonder Witch made by Qute Corporation, but
it almost all written in Japanese. I have a translated copy in rough
english (thanks to TransLingo!), and since it's updated frequently, i 
just put the necessary informations in this FAQ.


====================================================================

5.5) The Wonder Me-Xai:
-----------------------

Bandai was planning to release a digital camera attachment for the 
WonderSwan, entitled Wonder Me-Xia in september 1999. The device 
featured editing tools as well as other softwares.  

Anyone has more information about this device ??

====================================================================

Here's a big news for all Wonder Swan Fans, this is posted on the
site of Bandai of Japan (http://www.bandai.co.jp/eew/eewhome.htm)
        

EXECUTION OF A LETTER OF INTENT REGARDING AN ALLIANCE
BETWEEN BANDAI CO., LTD. AND MATTEL, INC.

On July 21, 1999, Bandai Co., Ltd. ("Bandai") executed a Letter of 
Intent with Mattel, Inc. ("Mattel") regarding global business 
alliance and an investment alliance.

The purpose of this alliance is for Bandai and Mattel to fully utilize 
the products, marketing and other business resources of the two 
companies in order to increase the businesses and revenues of both 
companies in the global market. The two companies will be forming a 
business alliance in order to obtain a synergy effect through effective 
use of the companies' respective strengths. The alliance will include:

Cooperation in the form of joint product development, joint marketing 
and joint sales; and Exploration of new business opportunities such as 
a global network business.

The first step towards the alliance will be discussion of the businesses 
set forth below, execution of the formal agreement at the end of August, 
1999 and commencement of the business alliance from October 1999:

1. Alliance in Japan (from October 1999): 
   Marketing and sales of Mattel products by 
   Bandai: Barbie doll, Hot Wheels 
   (miniature cars) and Fisher-Price

2. Alliance in Latin America (from October 
   1999): Marketing and sales of Bandai 
   products by Mattel: "Power Rangers" and 
   other Character toys for boys, etc. 

Since this is the first year of this alliance, its influence to this 
fiscal year will be very little. We are envisaging to achieve 10 
billion-yen mark in Japan and 5 billion-yen mark in Latin America at 
the next three years.

In order to strengthen the alliance between the two companies, and in 
order to provide sufficient business funds, Mattel will acquire up to 
a 5% interest in Bandai through the purchase of newly issued shares.  
Bandai has right to acquire up to a 5% interest in Mattel.

Mattel is the world's largest toy manufacturing, with sales of US$ 
4.782 billion (approximately 600 billion yen) in the year ended 
December 1998.  The Mattel group owns such long-selling products 
loved by people around the world as Barbie, of which over 1 billion 
were sold since first launched in 1959; Hot Wheels, with annual sales 
of over 150 million cars; toys for toddlers by Fisher-Price; American 
Girl by the Pleasant Company; and radio controlled cars by Tyco.  
Mattel is also actively developing new areas of businesses such as 
high tech toys for toddlers and the Internet business.

Bandai is active not only in Japan but around the world in merchan-
dising television and comic characters into toys, apparel, models, 
daily goods, and foods according to the markets' needs and tastes.  
In addition to original Bandai characters such original Digital 
Monsters toys, WONDER SWAN, a hand-held game launched this year, is 
showing very good sales.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Unbeleiveable but true! 

There is an Famicom emulator for playing on the Wonder Swan!
Since the screen of the Wonder Swan is smaller that the display
of a Famicom, you can scroll the screen with the Y button.

Only Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong JR. and Popeye works with the
emulator. You should know that for inserting roms in the Wonder
Swan you must have a Wonder Witch set. You can get the emulator at
this web page:

"http://www.playoffline.com/ww/index.html" (Japanese only)
FC emulator made by KAMI (mailto:m-kami@da2.so-net.ne.jp)

6.1) Game Reviews:
------------------

Crazy Climber on Wonder Swan by Michael White
---------------------------------------------

   I don't know if any one here is interested, but on a recent trip to
Japan I noticed a new portable game system from Bandai called Wonder
Swan.  This normally wouldn't have mattered to me a bit, except there's
a version of Crazy Climber for it.  Shortly after noticing that,
remembering that Crazy Climber is one of my all time favorite cames,
I was the owner of Wonder Swan with Crazy Climber (and Space Invaders and
a baseball game, too).

   Although Wonder Swan is small and in black and white (see
http://www.mayn.de/home/memm/gameboy/didknow03b.htm), Crazy Climber
is pretty accurate.  The left and right button groups are used
exactly like to two joysticks in the arcade.  In a matter of a 
minute or less, the movement was familiar.

   In addition, the graphics are nearly identical, although smaller
and in B&W.  The opening and closing windows with reflections, the
girders falling on you, the nasty old bird, the falling crazy climber
signs, etc...  I've only got a couple of complaints:

   - The audio pretty much sucks.  I know the Wonder Swan can do better.
   - Some things changed to avoid potential copyright problems.  For
     instance, King Kong no longer looks anything like Donkey Kong.  He's
     ugly as snot on the Wonder Swan.  Also, some of the music has changed,
     probably for the same reason.

   Also included is a Wonder Swan version, which I have not played much.
Don't know what the differences are.  One thing is that a flying turtle
craps on you rather than a bird.

   Given that the game is about $40, and the cartridge about $30, it's
not a bad deal.  In addition, with the un-backlit B&W display, the 
rechargeable battery will run attract mode for over 24 hours.  I've never
killed the rechargeable battery while playing.

   My opinion - if you want to play Crazy Climber any time without plunking
down the cash to buy the full size game (if you can find it) and can put
up with the small size, buy it.  Yeah, it's supposed to be Japan only now,
but you should be able to buy it mail order somewhere.
