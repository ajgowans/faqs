:1:Intro.

The WonderSwan (or WS) is a portable gaming system released by Bandai in 
the early Summer of 1999. Clocking in with the smallest dimensions and 
the higest resolution of any previous major portable system, the 
Wonderswan is currently taking Japan by storm (well, kind of...). A 
North American release (yes, with the same name) has been announced, but 
no date has been set.

As for this FAQ, I realised that there was next to nothing (read: 1 FAQ 
on GunPey) on the net on the WonderSwan info-wise, and felt that ths 
system was worthy of at least it's own FAQ... It's pretty rough right 
now, but it should do the trick... Feel free to send mail regarding 
corrections/info/etc... Anyway...

         _______________________________________
:3:Layout.

The WonderSwan has a very unique layout: it can be held either 
vertically, like a Nintendo Game Boy, or horizontally, like a Sega Game 
Gear or a NeoGeo Pocket (the orientation depends on the game). For the 
sake of simplicty, we'll look at the system horizontally, which is how 
the majority of games are played...


_____Buttons:
We have the following buttons:
  - left side: Power switch
  - front, top left hand corner: "Y" buttons, labeled *(1) to ****(4), 
with 1 being in the 12o'clock position, and the rest following 
clockwise.
  - front, bottom left hand corner: "X" buttons, labeled *(1) to 
****(4), just as the Y buttons.
  - front, near the middle, towards the left side: Sound button, and to 
it's right, the Start button.
  - bottom, towards the right hand side: Contrast volume.
  - front, bottom right hand side: "B" button, with the "A" button to 
it's right.

Most of the buttons change functions from game to game, but generally in 
horizontal mode, the X buttons serve as a directional pad, with the A 
and B buttons being action buttons. In vertical mode, the Y buttons 
function as a d-pad, with the X buttons being action buttons. The other 
buttons are pretty self-explanitory: The sound button changes from full 
volume to half volume to mute (unless headphones are plugged in - then 
it has no function). The Start button (usually) will start the game. The 
Contrast volume makes the contrast on the screen greater or lesser, so 
that you can adjust the screen to your light source.


_____I/O Jacks:
As for input/output jacks, we have just one:
  - right hand side: External jack

This external jack serves as a jack of all trades, to make a hideously 
bad pun. So far, it connects the headphones, link cable, or HandySonar 
to the WS. However, it isn't a normal headphone jack, so you must buy an 
adapter to use headphones with the system, and it also means that you 
can't play 2-player and use headphones at the same time, since the jack 
can only take one plug at a time (this is what you get in a system that 
retails for about $40).


_____Other layout features:
  - top right-hand corner: external speaker, for when you do not have 
headphones attached; rather weak...
  - back, middle bottom: battery holder/battery pack holder & release 
button: the WS comes with a battery holder that clips onto the back of 
the system, and is released by a small release button lever. Unlike most 
portable systems, the WS doesn't actually hold it's battery (1 AA) 
within the body - instead, you insert the battery in the holder, and 
then slide the holder into the WS. It's rather different, but rather 
nice when you look at the size of the optional battery pack.
  - back, middle top: cartridge slot: your basic cartridge slot; you 
insert the game of your choice in here before turning on the system's 
power.
  - back, top left corner: strap holder: for attaching a wrist or neck 
strap to the WS (both of which are very popular in Japan - if you look 
at the GameBoy Color or the NeoGeo Pocket Color, they both have them as 
well...)


_____Screen Icons:
The bottom of the screen has a bunch of little icons (or marks, as the 
instruction book calls them...) that occasionally light up. Here's 
what's what, going from left to right:

 - olive-looking (two circles) icon (Power On Mark): tells you that the 
system is on.
 - the cartridge icon (Intialize OK Mark): tells you that the cartridge 
has initiallized alright.
 - star icon: I have no clue, and I don't feel like translating at the 
moment...
 - battery icon (Low Energy Mark): battery or battery pack is running 
low...
 - speaker icon (Speaker Mark): tells you what level the WS' external 
speaker is set at; there are three levels - two waves (semi-circles) is 
full volume (which is still rather quiet), one wave is half volume, and 
no waves is mute. Disappears after a while, reappears when you change 
the volume...
 - headphone icon (Headphone Mark): tells you that you have headphones 
plugged in (this causes the speaker icon to disapper...
 - sideways man/right side up man (Orientation Mark): Tells you which 
way the WS should be oriented - if you're holding it, and the large 
cicle in the icon (the man's head) isn't pointing up, you're holding it 
the wrong way... (this should be pretty easy to figure out...)
 - circle icon (ETC Mark) - again, I have no clue... possibly changes 
depending on the game, since it's etc.?...

:4:Accessories.

Name:     Battery Pack
Price:    JY1950
Model #:  9094-0020
Function: Serves in place of the battery and battery holder. The battery 
pack ends up being flush with the back of the unit, which cuts down the 
thickness of the system by about 7cm.

Name:     Link Cable
Price:    JY1450
Model #:  9094-0030
Function: Links to WS units together for 2 player games.

Name:     Headphone Adapter
Price:    JY2700
Model #:  9094-0040
Function: Turns the WS's Ext. jack into a normal headphone jack, so that 
any pair of headphones with such a jack can be used instead of the 
external speaker. Includes the adapter and a pair of WonderSwan 'bud'-
style earphones.

Name:     Battery Pack Quick Charge Unit 
Price:    JY3800
Model #:  9094-0050
Function: Charges the battery pack for use. Includes the charger and one 
battery pack.

Name:     HandySonar
Price:    JY9800
Model #:  ?
Function: Serves as a submersable sonar device for fishing. You can see 
a representation of the water floor on the WS's screen.


A few notes on the above: 

  -All of the prices are the suggested retail price for Japan, and are 
listed in Japanese Yen (abbr. 'JY'). The current exchange rate for the 
US$ is hovering around 110-115yen to $1, although your price for 
importing these to the U.S., or your respective country, may be quite 
different.
  -As far as I know, all of the above items, with the exception of the 
HandySonar, are liensed by Bandai and distributed by Sammy, whose logo 
is quite prominent on the packaging.
  -I have also seen two promotional WS items that are worth mentioning: 
the first is a WonderSwan wrist strap that was given away with the 
system when it first came out (I believe), and the second is a carrying 
pouch that was given away when the new batch of two-tone colors (Frozen 
Mint, Soda Blue, and Sherbert Melon) came out in Mid-Summer 1999.

*1: There are two versions of this game, one with a mini-novelization  
(I think...) and one without. The mini-novel one is priced at JY3980, 
and the non-novel one is priced at JY2980.
*2: I think that's what this is... it's all in Kanji (and my Kanji is 
horrible...), and it's a Koei game... Actually, it's probably not, but I 
don't know any other Koei sim games... (It's the one with three 
kanji...)
*3: This is the Americanization of the name - the actual name is 
something that most people wouldn't recognise...
*4: I believe that's the English title for this anime series - if not, 
please let me know...
*5: Rockman in Japan = MegaMan in N.America/Europe, and Forte = Bass.
*6: Same thing as *2 - I can't read it, so I'm guessing... this one is 2 
kanji 'no' 2 kanji...
*7: Beatmania for WS comes with a mini-turntable that attaches to the B 
button... it's actually not that bad, all things considered...


Many of the games you will have heard of, and the ones that you haven't 
(like Terrors, Vaitz Blade, etc.) are fairly big titles here in Japan, 
so they deserve to be up there. 

As for the fact that you have heard of many of the games, Bandai is 
being smart and doing a ton of licencing. They went to other popular 
game companies (namely Square, Namco, and Capcom) and licenced their big 
names, and also went after popular anime (Conan and Evangelion). It's 
worked too... Ghosts & Goblins and Conan both have come out while I've 
been in Japan, and they've both sold out immediately most places 
(including Laox in Sendai, which is a mega-electronics store...)

_____Answers
Answers to questions that no one will probably ask, but just in case:
 - Yes, the worldwide name for the system will be WonderSwan.
 - No, I have no clue why they named the system the WonderSwan...
 - Yes, the name is slowly growing on me...
 - Yes, that is supposed to be the WS logo done in ASCII art at the top 
of the FAQ...
 - Yes, there have been other cool things that have had 'swan' in their 
name - check out late releases by the musical group 'Swans' 
(particularly "The Great Annihilator," "White Light from the Mouth of 
Infinity," and "Soundtracks for the Blind.")


_____Case Color
If you're trying to decide what color WS to get, I'd recomment Skeleton 
(Clear) Black - all of the cartridges that I've seen are clear black, 
and all of the accessories are opaque black, so everything matches 
nicely...

Another thought on the line of colors, the least popular color here in 
Japan is Skeleton Pink (as if you had to guess) - I've actually seen it 
discounted merely for it's color... 

And now for a short history of the case colors... Before the system was 
released, Bandai had a poll going on their web page as to what colors to 
release - there were about 20 different versions, if memory serves. When 
the system was released, there were 7 versions available (the 4 Skeleton 
(or see-through) colors, the 2 Metallic colors, and Pearl White). On 
July 22, the 2 Metallic colors and Pearl White were discontinued to make 
way for the 3 Two-Tone colors (Frozen Mint, Soda Blue, and Sherbert 
Melon). These casings have clear colored front casings and clear white 
back casings (hence the name Two-Tone). Even though the Metallics and 
Pearl are discontinued, they are not that hard to find here in Japan, so 
if you're interested in one of them, hunt around a bit.


_____Popularity
As for the popularity of the WS, it's the second most popular portable 
system right now. The breakdown is like this (this comes from the weekly 
game charts from http://come.to/magicbox/  -I have always thought that 
it was Famitsu Weekly, but they don't publish the system sales, just 
about 10 other charts... anyways...):

1. GameBoy Color
2. WonderSwan
3. NeoGeoPocket Color
4. GameBoy Pocket
5. GameBoy Light
6. NeoGeo Pocket

The GameBoy will be entrenched in first for a long time, but the WS is 
doing about twice the business that the NGPC is... the other three are 
so far behind it;s not even funny, and since they're all just 
variations.... (Note that the Sony Pocketstation and the Dreamcast VMU 
aren't counted as portable systems: they're accessories for console 
systems...)


_____WS Web Page

The official WonderSwan web page is located at:

http://www.swan.channel.or.jp

Keep in mind that it is a Japanese page, so more than likely you'll get 
a bunch of garbage for letters (note: I haven't been able to get 
Netscape to display Japanese, but IE and NeoPlanet can - you have to 
download the Japanese language add-on for IE from Microsoft, though...)

_____Versions

23aug99:0.88: Added the missing color, Metallic Blue, and wrote a short 
section on the history of the colors. Also added the address for the 
official WS web page...

22aug99:0.87: Wrote the initial version in one sitting. Probably full of 
mistakes, as my reference material consisted of a WS brochure and the WS 
Instruction Book.... Still need the internal specs for the system... and 
translations for a few icons... other than that it's pretty complete for 
now...
