================================

  1. INTRODUCTION

Lode Runner for WonderSwan is a nice port of Lode Runner with unique levels 
and optional treasures(feathers and some weird cake monster.) Basically you 
run around a maze of ladders and ropes collecting gold and digging temporary 
holes to fall in and to stick enemies in, much like all other versions. 
However the levels are a bit basic and the new icons, water, only seem to 
make the game slower--especially since you often need to pause to scroll 
around to see the whole screen. But still with 126 levels of fun in story 
mode it's hard to beat if you want a game that's fun and not too challenging, 
and though the last few levels have the obligatory tricks, the new crumbly 
blocks that dissolve when you step on them, and level designs can't create 
enough new puzzles for the game to soar. Lode Runner junkies will probably 
prefer the GBA version instead, but it beats the pants off plain ports of the 
original Apple levels(SNES Lode Runner Twin, etc.) So I felt it was worth 
FAQing.

Lode Runner is broken into 5 worlds of 24 levels + a bonus level if you get 
enough of the optional goodies(feathers, cake) and a big bonus level at the 
end, for a total of 126.

If you want to emulate this game, Cygne works better than wonderswan.exe, 
which crashes after the first level. I got both from zophar.net.

The solutions in this FAQ will generally focus on ways to win the level with 
digging as few enemies as possible--this is an innovation in the arcade and 
GBA versions, where you get a bonus for nobody killed/dug and I think it 
could have helped this game a bit.

This FAQ has some mini-graphs of areas in the game and has a few terms to 
know, i.e. U=go up til you hit something, UL=upper left corner(or, in 
relation, 2U2L means 2 up 2 left,) UL-1D=1 below the UL, 2L=go 2 squares 
left. And numbers label the order you dig specific areas in.

A 3-2-1 dig refers to digging 3 squares in a row, falling into that well, 
digging 2 and falling in there, then digging 1. I will assume that you will 
escape to safety when I don't explicitly mention it and I may refer to 3-
pits(horizontal) and 3-shafts(vertical) and 3-caves(horizontal, encased) or 
encased meaning surrounded by bricks on all sides.

  2. CONTROLS

Level start:

START: speeds up scrolling
A: start with scuba gear(you are slower)
B: start as yourself(very fast)
Level movement doesn't start until you move or dig.

B: dig left
A: dig right

START: pauses game so you can search around.


Movement compass:
  X1
X4  X2
  X3

Possible vertical movements(without falling) trump horizontals when you try 
to go diagonally.

You cannot dig something under a rope.

  3. SCORING AND STRATEGY

Enemies' movements are pretty simple. Squid will try to get on the same row 
with you then run at you. They will always try to go up the nearest ladder to 
chase after you. Crabs move back and forth between bricks--if a brick is dug, 
they still bounce back and forth. Crabs do not fall into holes, but they will 
extend their range if a crumbly blocking it is destroyed.

--You can often pot an enemy with just one dig if they're at all away from 
you. But it does take you a while to dig something.
--Guys often take longer to get out of pits than in other versions of Lode 
Runner, so you need to dig fewer holes.
--Sometimes you want to survive without killing enemies, as if they are 
trapped in a place they can't leave, it's better than if they reappear 
randomly.
--Since all the monsters have the same AI, you can often string three of them 
along behind you at once--and run to the other side.
--Use pause to see where a bad guy regenerates, or where he is, or to make 
sure they're clumped together.
--When over a crab's range, drop on him when he just passes under you and is 
going towards the far side.
--Try to trap guys in a pit by falling at the right time.
--Squid can be bumped up against crabs near a wall at great inconvenience to 
both.
--In general, don't worry about water.
--If you're lost, pause the game and get your bearings and look for 
directions.
--If you need to go to the top, don't kill bad guys. They can kill you before 
fully formed. Just dig one hole and run over them.
--If you dig 2 holes in a row you can run back over bad guys without killing 
them, but it is tricky--the first hole will heal before the second walks over 
it.
--You can walk over a nearly reformed hole safely.

  4. WALKTHROUGH WITH MAPS

== MAP LEGEND ==

U = you
- = them
X = regular brick
% = crumbly
* = cement
$ = treasure
F = feather
+ = extra goody
~ = rope
H = ladder
h = ladder to next level
^ = door to next level
, = water

Note that because of the way water operates, we don't have separate icons for 
underwater gold and non-underwater. You know that water spreads left and down 
when it can.

Very introductory. You won't encounter bad guys unless you release them, and 
there are no pits to fall into.

Go right for gold then go up the ladder for the feather before you fall left. 
Go along the bottom and climb Up, 1L, U and get the gold. Fall left.

Go to the UR and get that gold. Fall, go back up and left across the rope and 
fall left a bunch. Fall right from the top rope. Then get on the top rope and 
go left and drop for gold. A ladder will appear to the left. Go up the chute.

For this level you actually have an enemy that chases you, but you can dig to 
leave him well behind, or to move past him if he's in your way.

Go left to the ladder, dig right, get the gold and climb up. Get the gold on 
to and the feather too. Fall onto the rope right, left, right, left, left, 
right to get the tricky gold. Now go up the far right ladder and drop down 
for more gold. Fall right and go left off the ladder for the final gold.

Go right for gold then go up the ladder for the feather before you fall left. 
Go along the bottom and climb Up, 1L, U and get the gold. Fall left.

Go to the UR and get that gold. Fall, go back up and left across the rope and 
fall left a bunch. Fall right from the top rope. Then get on the top rope and 
go left and drop for gold. A ladder will appear to the left. Go up the chute.

Here you can get rid of your enemy pretty quickly. Let him get close and go 
up the ladder, left on the rope and up and right and dig to get the gold 
below the cement. Go U-R and wait for the brick to re-form and then fall 
right--but wait for the enemy to get near. He'll fall into that place with no 
way to get out, and you have a free hand. In the DR, dig over the + and the 2 
$'s. Dig UR and R of the one $. In the UR, dig 2-1 to get to the 3 $'s and 2-
1 to get out.

The center gold is not too tough. On the top, dig either way from the rope. 
Below, dig either way, drop and dig below that. For the feater, dig 2U R and 
U R of it and get out and fall right. The exit is R and U.

You need to figure out how to ditch your enemies. The false bricks don't make 
things any easier for the beginner, but once you see the map you can work out 
what to do. R L U L for two gold and go to the top and immediately right and 
drop over the right of the two golds. The ground will crumble and you'll drop 
on one gold. Drop right and left and climb back up for the remaining gold. 
Stand in the UL 'til the enemies come near and climb down. When they fall, 
circle around on the rope and go down a bit. They're stuck there, and you 
just have cleanup.

The cleanup is a bit tricky--go up the center ladder and right so you drop 
onto the bonus and the rope. Then you can go 1R and drop onto another 
crumbly. Go up the right side and stand over the gold there. Then go up the 
right and stand over the feather on the crumbly. Dig over the encased gold to 
fall through and get the last one. For all this the enemies will be stuck on 
the left. Now a door will appear at the bottom center and you need to enter 
that. You may have to dig to get the enemies to follow you, or you can just 
climb up before you get to the door and distract them that way.

****************************

Go left for the gold and dig to get by the enemy. Now you can climb up and 
you will want to take care of the right side first so you don't release the 
one enemy right away. You may want to fall off right and work your way back 
up. Then fall off the left from the top to pick up more gold. Whenever you've 
shaken the one free enemy, run left over the trapped one and the crumbly will 
release him. Dig right on getting the gold, then dig right over your enemy. 
That will create the ladder up the right side and you should have time to 
reach over for the feather before going all the way up.

Dig right immediately and get the gold. Go UR and dig over the encased gold 
in the center, then get the cake at the top. Fall right and drop for one 
gold, then back to the top of that ladder and fall right all the way for 
another.

Now dig over one feather to get it and get the gold on the far right. Then 
wait for things to heal and dig over the other feather and get the gold near 
it. Go to the top and dig to get around the one enemy if you have to. Dig the 
other guy out of his mess and you should back up to the DL, dig and wait for 
the other guy to get near before going up the stairs. It'll be easy to dig 
over the remaining gold in the 2-pit that had housed the enemy. The exit is 
down, right and up.

This level marks your first encounter with water. Go straight left and up and 
dig down twice to get the suspended gold and feather. Then go back up the 
stairs and drop into the water. Get the gold and dig out--wow, the whole area 
below fills with water. Go up left of the rope and 3D when you see an enemy 
going along the rope. Now you can focus on the top pool.

Go to the top and drop down when the crab goes left of the cake. Dig from the 
DR to get out of there. Then drop in the DL after the crab left and dig again 
to get out.

Now there is a possibility your two enemies may have a chest between them. If 
they don't, just dig to their side to release them, but if they do, you need 
to dig, back up and dig some more. The door is in the shallow pool where they 
were.

This level's symmetry makes it pretty easy to get through. Go up the stairs 
to your right and dig at the top to get the feather. Now you'll need to dig 
down a couple times below--once straight between the UL feather and the $ and 
once 2U1R and 1U of the suspended gold. Then dig over the suspended gold 
below that and wait in the DL corner for enemies to come. Run to the top and 
dig over one gold, then dig 1U1R and 1R of the other to sneak in. The enemies 
get trapped on the far left.

That leaves you to take care of the UR as you did the UL, but in a mirror 
image. They will be too slow to bother you, and you can take the UR ladder to 
level 9.

This is another symmetrical level where you can trap the enemies on one side. 
Drop right and dig and then dig the left square on the 4-pit to get to the 
encased gold. Now you can fall down and go left--get the gold in the DL and 
head back right and up. You'll make it before the bad guys get to the center. 
They'll go back left.

Go over the crumblies to land on the rope. Dig a side and drop. At the top, 
fall and dig 2L of the stairs for one gold, then dig for the entombed gold on 
the right. Come back around right and uop and left and dig over the gold 2R 
of the center-left stairs. Now you will need to goad your enemies right and 
come back left. Easy enough--you can go to the bottom center-right and wait. 
Then go up and left past them. Drop on the single rope and dig and get the 
final gold. The stairs are in the UR--you may need to fake the enemies out 
once more. Wait by the stairs, climb, and run past them.

Get the two encased golds below first. Dig as follows:

71H2
 3H4
 6H5
Get the gold after digging 5, then when 1 heals, dig 7. The enemies will 
clump right of you if you wait. Let them follow you UL--you can keep them at 
a distance--get the gold, dig over the feather and fall left twice. That gets 
the gold in the water. Climb UR out and dig over a suspended gold. At least 
one of the enemies should now be trapped on the left, making the rest easy. 
Fall on the cake and at the top, get the gold and dig right, fall, and dig 
right and fall. Dig over the feathber and for your final stunt you will want 
to dig over the remaining suspended gold in the center.

A bad guy may be there so dig for him and have him fall in before you fall 
over the gold. Fall off the rope and wait for anyone so you can dig something 
for them. Then go L-U to the door.

While there's some worry you may get trapped, it's not really too bad if you 
get to things right away. Climb up and fall for the feather. Then go to the 
UL for gold and dig on the top of the heart to get the gold in there. Go to 
the bottom and you can let guys chase you to the DL.

Dig 2 holes left then go up the stairs. Your enemies will regenerate on the 
left. Then drop down the second rope and keep falling left 'til the bottom. 
Run right and up. Your enemies will have to go left and up, so you can drop 
down the third and fourth ropes falling left to repeat this.

Then go to the top again. Wait for the guys to come and when one is near the 
rightmost rope go 2D so he drops. The other guys will too. You can then drop 
off the two left ropes and left without the enemies bunching up and waiting 
for you at the bottom.

You can get rid of most of your enemies before they are even really a 
problem. Go L U R for gold and back left. The other guy will follow. Dig 1U1R 
of the cake and climb down. Get the goodies and go back up. Fall off the 
right edge just as the enemy's over the ladder. Dig 2 holes for your enemies-
-wait a bit after digging the first so the second guy doesn't get caught--and 
take any gold that appears. Then fall off as before, trapping another guy. 
Third time won't work sadly but you've got a good start.


If you are in a really mean mood, let the last guy follow you as you drop 
from the right rope and go to the DR+1U--he'll be at the center-right ladder. 
When the crab goes under, fall left and get the gold and go right and, at the 
last minute, up. That should make things a lot easier--dig over the 
feather(false brick below) and gold. And gold below that. You can run back 
left so the enemy goes right when you go up the stairs.

Dig over the center gold, then the 2 squares below that. Fall through the 
crumbly in the pit. Get the feather and climb up the stairs to re-trap the 
enemy. Dig serially down again and take a side ladder up and go to the center 
to advance.

Be careful not to kill anyone here as they will regenerate at the top, where 
it's tough to remove them.

R U L R U L R U and then dig over the entombed gold and fall and wait. R U 
and steo over the entombed and on each 1-stair below, dig left and fall and 
get the goods. Run to the UR and fall into the top area and dig a hole for 
the suspended gold. Go over the center ladder and dig and go all the way 
down.

Now this part is a bit tricky as enemies can each use the ladders to trap 
you. Wait until one is close and go to the top. Then climb down and wait for 
one guy to almost touch you. All the way U/L. When they start running L and 
you, go down and dig over the suspended gold. You may need to check to make 
sure nobody has a gold--there should be one you picked up along the way after 
falling--but after that just knock out the crumbly at the very top once the 
crab goes back left. Get the gold and dig over the door that just appeared.

R U L fall for one gold. Then dig R and go 1D, repeat from the UL for the 
feather. Dig over where it was. When you fall, dig the enemy to get by him 
and then get the gold and dig for the feather. Get by him again and go to the 
top. When everyone's chasing you, take a ladder on the left down and run 
across the bottom center bit with the gold. Everything will crumble.

The right is symmetric to thbe first and you can just pick stuff off one gold 
at a time, leaving the enemies on the left. That leaves the center.

Dig as follows and drop on the rope. Fall left when a guy hits the corner and 
dig right. Fall and go back up top and dig 4-6 and fall right, then when the 
crab turns left, fall right again and dig and get out. Now you probably can 
just run U all the way, R-U or you can wait for guys to approach you to make 
sure.

Again controlling your enemies and by not killing them makes things easier.
 
Wait, then fall right when you can see a guy. Stand under the ladder and when 
you see them all falling, zigzag up and take the rope left, falling off that 
edge. Dig over the 2 stacked gold and wait til the guys bunch. Then dig right 
on the false brick. Fall right amd right again. They'll fall off after you 
and you can climb back up--you may need to wait in just the right spot to 
turn a guy back left so he falls. Tap back left if someone goes right. This 
leaves the left for the taking.

Drop through the false brick and dig left. Then get the 2 stacked gold just 
left as follows:

41
$2
$3

1&2, wait 2 seconds, dig 3 then dig 4 when 1 heals. Mirror image this for the 
DL corner. Get the feathers at the top. Dig over the square below, which is a 
crumbly, and immediately go right and dig right to land on the ladder. D L U. 
Dig the left edge when the crab turns back right, then dig the squares below 
that to get to the row of 4 gold. Back out.

Now you need to go back right. You can wait just beneath the cake for enemies 
to clump and fall right. Here you don't need to pay much attention to if you 
trap an enemy or not. You can win the level right now or pick up the cake and 
go through the zigzag again.

Dig over each suspended gold on top from right to left, then go to the UL and 
dig the next. Go left to right for the next set down. Go down the ladder to 
the right, wait for enemies to start to follow, and go back up and right so 
you can dig over the suspended gold in the center O. Then take care of the Y 
in the DL.

Dig 1, wait 3 seconds, dig 2 and when 1 re-forms, go U 2L and get $. Don't 
wait where you dug 1 or enemies will chase you. Now if you are clever you can 
dig the left side of the C to get the cake and go back, or you can go up the 
big ladder and down to make sure of things.

Now go to the UL and wait for enemies to lump togethber and go down. The 
three will be right of you--go U and in the center 0, dig over the suspended 
gold in the center and fall. Get the feather and dig out. Dig for the gold 
under the N, then the gold in the P.

Now you can just leave and avoid the timing puzzle(ladder in the top center.) 
For the timing puzzle, fall in each side of the watery 0 when the enemy is on 
the opposite side of you. You may want to bring an enemy close to you before 
the final climb so you can make it more conveniently.

Go to the bottom and left to get gold, then right. Stay on the right half. 
Wait for a guy to come by and dig him out of the way and climb up the right 
stairs. Now you can work your way to the top, first by detouring to the DR 
for that gold, then taking the gold above then the feather. You'll need to go 
to the top and dig down a bit, but after clearing the right, wait by the 
right rope and climb down the ladder when all three guys are on the right. 
Then walk to the left and take out everything and take the level-ladder in 
the UL.

Go to the UR. Fall on the gold and then go 1R to dissolve the crumblies and 
fall on the feather. Then go down the ladder left of you and fall left so 
that you activate the crumbly. Get the gold at the bottom.

Fall from the top rope over the lone-space in the 3x3 block in the UR, dig 
right, fall and dig left. Fall onto the gold. If someone is in the right, let 
him follow you. It's best if both enemies follow you--then you can go to the 
bottom and back UL and flip them over.

Zap the three bricks in the DL to get the DL gold. Get the others in the UL. 
Release the barricaded enemy on the left and dig a hole for him. Let him 
follow you UR and then drop into the right bit and go D L U.

Now you can drop onto the waterlogged part to get the gold--when the crab is 
below it and facing right. You can exit now to the UL or you can drop on the 
feather and go 2R U and wait for the crab to come back right and go D L and 
dig left for the cake. Then go L-U.

This is not a bad level at all if you remember a simple rule--go to the top 
rope you can, then over the old you wish to get and drop when one guy is 
close. Then run back to a main ladder as needed. There may be another guy 
behind him, but you can outrun him too. If you need to run across the screen, 
go to the DL or DR and wait before doing so. Clear out the whole board this 
way. If someone grabs a chest, dig him up on the bottom--this also gives you 
a bit of extra time to clear the bottom, too.

It pays to know where the crumblies are--in this case, UL and UR of the 5-
wide of gold. Dig when on each one of them to go down a slide to get gold. 
Then when at the bottom go right(only one guy that way) and dig him out and 
go back UR. You can tolerate one guy on one side for a while but if you want 
to bring everyone over, then dig a hole 2R of the ladder, let a guy fall in 
and dig 1R of a ladder. You can also trap him and hope he reappears on the 
left. If so you can drag everyone over.

But basically you need to dig 1R1D of the crumbly, (optional) get the feather 
and get on the UR platform--where you can also dig to stall your opponent 
before going to the UR. Then repeat on the other side. The tricky dig is in 
the middle.

   1
  X23
 XX45X
%XX6XX%

This will let you fall on the middle gold.

Note since there are 3 guys for 2 sides, one side will have only one guy at 
all times. And after getting the last gold you can outrun everyone to the 
top.

You'll basically want to work left to right here, but the start is key. Stand 
at the ladder base and keep tapping up until everyone is on it. Then go left 
and wait for them to clump near and then U R U L. When everyone else is near 
you can dig and fall left. Wait for everyone to get near, then U all the way 
and R and dig over the gold. Drop in.

Now work the right side--dig L of a gold, drop down for it, 2L 2D 2R and 
repeat. They'll never get close to you though you may need to go up quickly 
after the last gold. Repeat for the next ladder over but now you have more 
time. Climb up the right level ladder and detour for the feather before 
exiting.

I had problems dropping too far down here so basically I would recommend that 
you drop right/left off the rope and back left/right before digging the next 
down--you'll have to repeat this several times.

1L, dig left, dig right and go up the stairs. Go left to the 1-rope and dig 
L, L-fall R dig L, etc. until you get the gold. Now fall left--you should 
have two guys on the left--and run right, maybe digging once to bag the other 
guy who may have gold, and go up the stairs to dig the 1-ropes on the right. 
Climb up and drop down the center for two golds--no need to dig constantly. 
Just at the bottom. Climb to the UR to get the feathers and then drop left 
until you're near the center.

Now you can lure guys up to the 1-ropes and then drop off the edge and they 
will be trapped where they can't get out, making the rest easier. You could 
probably work around them, but why sweat.

Go to the UL for treasure and dig down twice. Dig-R R L dig-R drop for 1 
gold, then mirror that on the right. Now there's one gold left at the top. 
Dig right of it, get the gold and go 2R and up the level ladder.

This level is more of an administrative hassle than anything. You'll need to 
go through each building a few times.

For starters, dig left and then climb up the stairs. Clear out the right 
building first. You will want to dig onto the feather and 1R, dig left, drop 
etc. Sometimes you will just fall on 1R. In that case, go left before you dig 
left. Repeat, flipping left and right, and that is one building done.

The left building also isn't too bad. Drag everyone right and go left. Dig 
over the 2nd-right square, get the loot, and dig over the 2nd-right gold of 
the four. You'll fall through. Dig 3-2-1 below to get out and go back to the 
UL. Then dig the leftmost of the open squares on the way down--1R dig L fall, 
etc. Then dig the rightmost when you can.

The center has its tricky points, but let's just clear what we can in the 
first. Dig the UL and fall. Then L-R-fall. L-fall. R-L-fall. R-fall. L-R-
fall. Now go back up. I don't see a way to clear this without taking three 
trips.

Dig over the 2nd-left to fall on that, then dig left, fall, 1R and dig left 
and fall, then fall right twice. Go L U.

Dig over the far right and 1L and dig right and fall, then fall all the way 
down. L U.

Dig over the 2nd-left and fall. Dig right and fall. Dlg left and fall. The 
door will be just left after you fell through all the false bricks.

This is the first bonus level. It is really not so tough. Fall left and go up 
all the way. Fall left. Dig over the gold so the enemy doesn't escale. In the 
lower part, there are two lower 1-ropes DL/DR of other 1's. Dig while on each 
of them to fall for some gold. Then dig to the 1-ropes in the center and dig 
right, fall right, L, dig right. By the center bit, dig right and fall right 
onto the crumbly.  Go to the bottom and back up and 2-1 dig to get a 
suspended gold, then 2-1 for the other.

Dig right of the entombed UL enemy, left of him and right of him. If you dig 
while standing over him then you can maybe fall after him and get him to 
follow you, which saves time. If not, go to the bottom to dig him up and get 
his gold.

Go up a center stair and dig over the crumbly to get the final gold. Approach 
the right side as you did the left. Release the bad guy as before(dig L, R 
and L of him).

If you need to do anything else, sucker bad guys to the top so you can drop 
down and get the level door at the bottom center.

Now on to world 2.

Go left and up. Dig while on the rope. Fall right and dig and wait for the 
enemies to come back left. Get on the ladder and when they're all following, 
drop off the rope and run right and go up. If one does not leave gold behind, 
you'll have to dig later. In any case, go to the UL for gold and dig L3U L2U 
of the feather to fall on it. Dig right to get out. Go back R U.

Now you have a tricky dig with the 3-row of gold.

Climb to the top once more and fall right in the UR. Fall left then L U L U 
and you win--unless someone still has some gold. In that case you will need 
to entrap everyone and let their regenerations follow you to the DL where you 
can go up to shake them off. You may still have to dig one guy, but that's no 
problem.

gold on the left edge. Dig UL and L2U of the feather to get it(left is a 
crumbly) and in the UL, dig and go R wait for other guys to come before going 
D L and digging out. You can sucker two guys in thbere. Then work your way 
down--R D R for gold. L D R for another, then fall R and R, then dig UL and L 
of the feather.

For the DR, go R on the platform above the rope and you'll hit a false brick. 
1R 2L, fall again, L and all the way U. You need to cear out the watery area 
and drop onto each $ when the crab is under it and going towards the center. 
The bad guys may approach you, but you can go into the DR and dig your way

Do the first steps quickly--otherwise you'll have to spend time digging 
enemies out of the way. Dig down for the 2-gold and the feather, and then 
below that, dig again for a hard to reach gold. Dig the right square and fall 
right a bunch. Dig 1R of the stair to the right and go R U when someone falls 
in, then R U again--just under an enemy. Fall right and get the gold and dig 
over the cake. If all is well, three guys should be stuck in the bottom 
center.

Walk into the top center from the right for gold--follow the crab. Dig for 
the UR gold. Get out, take the rope under to the left and U R and get the 
feather left of the crab. Then drop from the rope and dig left and go down in 
order to get the suspended gold.

You'll have to avoid some enemies--or maybe get a gold piece. Dig 'em up and

you don't even need to try to get out.

Dig 1-3. Dig 4 when 1 heals, then 6-7-8. Dig 5 to fall through and get them 
all. Get the DL gold.

The center has a similar puzzle but with digging only 1-6 and falling through 
6. Then if you can get by enemies the DR is the same thing. And it shouldn't 
be too hard--a brutal way is to just wipe them out and that should take them 
out of commission for a bit. With luck you can get one to trap the crab on 
the right and just walk over them to get the feather and dig left before they 
get you. If it doesn't work out, release them and try again.

Although you can also lead enemies into the shafts where gold used to be--dig 
the 3 squares on top and the enemies will fall in. Just be sure it's all 
empty first.

Getting the feather and cake in the UR is pretty easy too as you are just 
stepping on crumblies--run 1R when you land though.

Go right and down the stairs. Dig 1 when you can see the enemy falling, then

Clear out wat you can either way--mostly digging over what's there. Walk into

Now you need to make sure the enemy is in the V in the DR--if not, get him to 
follow you there. Fall right when on the rope.

Dig left when 1L of the UR for more crumblies to a $ and feather. Fall right

While the bottom is cement, you can rely on enemies dropping down the ladders 
to get to you instead of crawling diagonally. However, if you time things 
right you can go right then UR, wait for the guy to pass underneath, then 
fall into the right bit and dig right and go right just as the guy falls in 
above you. You'll have to take care of him again later, but with only enemies 
on one side chasing you, you won't get trapped.

You can just lure them to the bottom then go to the top. Fall off the edge of 
the rope near the center ladder and dig below it. The brick you land on is </pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
fake--di towards the center and fall in. Then fall to get a gold. Repeat for 
the other side. Then you can go to the top of the right ladder(next to the 
rope)and wait for enemies to come by. When they are in the center, 2D and 
they will fall down the center. Now they don't matter. Clear out the left and 
then dig 1L of the trapped guy in the UR and dig to release his gold. Fall 
down the center to win.

This one's a lot easier once you get all three of them on the same side. Dig 
the guy on your side up until he doesn't reappear there any more and thben 
dig over the $ and F nearby. Then go to the top and dig over the $ to drop 
down and then go right immediately to get the treasure, then fall left. Get 
al the stuff along the bottom. If an enemy is trapped below, dig to the left, 
dig a hole on the left, then go right and dig a hole there--you may need two 
to drop below when the crab faces right.

At the top, let the bad guys drop when they get close to you. Then drop into

Take the gold on the left and go up the left side--but stop near the top when 
in line with the ladder top to the right. Now pick off the three golds nearby 
and go back up. The two guys on the ladder to the right will follow.

Now go down the ladder so they will walk left and chase you--when they're 
close, D R U and wait. They'll e stuck on the far left. Another guy will run 
at you, but D and fall right all the way to the bottom. Wait for him to get 
near and then go to the top and drop on the UL feather, then zigzag down. 
Climb back up and drop on the other feather after you get the UR gold. Now 
you will need  to go across the top rope, drop on the gold and fall left. Go 
down the stairs, right and down and right near the bottom for the final gold.

Well, you don't have to bother with enemies at the start. So clear everything 
out first. Dig over the feather above where you started, then back U UR R and 
climb for the other feather. Go to the right edge and UR and dig over the 
square above the 3 gold--there are 2 false blocks below. Dig and drop down 
either way. Fall into the left bit and drop wen the crab turns back right. 2-
1 dig to get out and go back up the UR. If you just want to buy time, fall 
left off the UR before going back inside.

When the guy passes over the left gold, fall right from the right ladder. Now 
you can either grab the gold and dig to the right, or you can grab the gold, 
1R, dig L, 1R, dig L and fall left. The second way is a little trickier, and 
besides, you can always come back and dig once for the feather later, falling 
down from the right ladder and digging right after the crab goes right.

Now dig the guys out and head D/R. They will head D/L as long as you fall 
down the first ladder. Then you can go back UL. If you have a perfect run you 
can dig right, get the gold and go back up the stairs, but if not the enemies 
are a bit wiser now--they'll follow you DR but they'll never catch you if you 
goad them up the side and fall left from the UR.

Not much choice to start--you should be able to get two guys to follow you up 
to the UR, then off left. Drop 1D when they are near and they will fall in 
the crumbly pit. Now you can deal with the rest of the board. Go to the 
leftmost 1-rope on top and drop when the crab is 2R of you. Then run right. 
You may have to run back left after getting the final gold since you're 
faster than he is, but you'll be able to use the crumblies to save time. Fall 
onto the gold below in the right. Now dig:

12XX
H3XX
H4XX
H5~X
H*6X

Now back to the UR and dig over the feather area. Drop and dig and drop over 
the crumbly--there's a chute down. Get the gold and dig left. Climb up the 
middle stair and fall left to get another gold. Run left for a feather. Now 
fall chez le crab again. Drop through the crumbly on the left for some gold 
then dig below it for another. Drop left and get the gold on the ledge, but 
drop right--we'll get the other gold later.

At the top, drop from the left 1-rope and fall right 3x for gold then fall 
left 2x. Now the tricky part--digging for the last bits. On the 4-rope dig 
left twice. Fall from the right edge of the 4-rope and quickly dig above the 
feather to get it. Go to the bottom and 1U on the center ladder. See where 
people are coming from with the pause feature and if the regenerated guy is 
on the left, go right and wait for folks to come down near the DR so that 
when you go up, they go up the center. If on the right, wait and go D R and 
dig him to get to the top.

If they're up the center ladder, fall in the L and center-L of the pit and 
you will clear everything--getting the $ after you fall, digging right and 
going right. If they are split, your best bet is to dig them to oblivion and 
go up the center ladder. See which way is less crowded and go that way--dig 
once so nobody gets trapped. There's a small jam with enemies appearing at 
the top of the side ladders that makes things speculative, and the right is a 
bit safer than the left, but if you are really in dire straits you can sucker 
guys up the center ladder if you must.

Because so much gold in this level is a nuisance to pick up, it pays to plan 
what to get, where, at the start.
Dig the bad guy to the left so you can dig down the left edge first. There's 
a bit of a trick to getting up--the bad guys may arrive in clumps. You may 
need to stand over the hole of one guy who fell in to move on to the next 
one. You need to do the following:

1. Dig 2L of the feather below and straight down(must go to top)
2. Pick up the gold 2L as you go up, then fall left off the 2nd-top platform, 
from the right ladder, onto the feather. Drill down.
3. Dig over the gold on the 2nd-top patform. Dig straight down.

Through this you can use the 2nd'top platform as a starting place or even as 
a place to decoy guys blocking your way to the top. It will take them a while 
to regenerate. You probably need to look ahead to see where everyone is, 
although you can risk things by staying in one place and digging everyone up 
and hoping nobody appears in the UR. Still you will probably have to work 
your way to the top using the side ledges and you may even have to fall back.

Another way to stop so many guys regenerating at the top is to manage to 
leave just one at the bottom. You can accomplish this by digging 4 or 5 holes 
when they are lumped together nearby. If you can leave 2 trapped, so much the 
better. But in any case you may wish to pause and scroll up so nobody 
surprises you on the way down--while you can run back you have to be paying 
close attention.

You can also dig at the very bottom ledge, left edge, and fall left and the 
guy you caught will fall left behind you.

Dig left, get the gold to the left and work to the top--two more gold there. 
Dig if the bad guy gets close. Dig 1L of the water to the right, in the 
middle of the ladder. You have to go there before taking care of the rest of 
this. When the crab comes back left, drop right, go 2R and dig L. Clear out 
the next bit. Dig right when over the trapped bad guy. You'll go over the 
crumbly.

Fall right, go up the ladder and dig left. You should climb up to clear the 
gold before releasing the guy in the DL. 

While you can dig left at the ladder, 2R, dig left and trap the bad guy, it 
requires exact play. Just lurre him right and dig left and dig behind you, 
then dig to get the DL gold. He'll regenerate but you can take him as he 
comes.

Dig as above, running right ASAP, waiting 2 seconds to dig 3. You can move 
down the stairs and up to trap the guy if you have to dig at 2. Fall through 
5 and repeat, replacing 5 with 2, to get the other gold. You may have to shoo 
off some enemies--don't get the gold 'til they're out of the picture. If they 
come across on the rope, drop to the bottom and dig. You need to wait between 
2 and 3 anyway.

Now you can just drop on most of the loose gold as you go up--first you may 
wish to go to the UL and fall right into the 2-pit and dig down, because 
enemies get stuck in the 2-pit, which is the only way to the gold right below 
it. Enemies aren't too hard to dig up, but why not take a shot at something 
more convenient? If they fall in first, get all the other gold then dig them 
out.

For the gold in the center, drop to the 4-pit from the left and dig on one 
edge--either has a crumbly. Get the feather and dig straight down. You'll 
probably have only the gold right of the top center now and you'll need to go 
back in the 4-pit and dig right and fall right twice for that.

When you go to the UL on completing, up the left side, detour right of the 
level ladder for two treasures before climbing up. You may have to dig your 
way back past enemies, but that won't be hard.

1R, dig left, 1L, dig left and fall down the crumblies. Get the cake to the 
left. At the bottom of the ladder, dig right twice for a guy to fall in. When 
he dies, go up and right and dig down the center over the feather. If bad 
guys are lumped right of you, you may wish to fake up the long ladder and 
down. There's a crumbly below--R/L and back up.

From the bottom you can run to the top pretty easily.

Drop left from the top into the watter. Dig either side of the nonwaterlogged 
gold--onto a crumbly. Go back to the top and dig R of the rope, fall, dig R 
and get the gold and exit. That area can now house killed enemies. You don't 
need to drop them in there, but it helps. Dig UL and L of the encased 
feather. In the UR, dig over the feather and a crumbly will kick you down. 
Dig 1L3U of the gold on the right and more crumblies. Now you have a triangle 
of gold left in the DR and you should dispose of them as in the DL. Step on 
the crumbly to the right and dig over thbe center one. The level lader is in 
the center.

Run right for the feathber ASAP, then go L U and fall left for gold(chute at 
the end.) There's also a chute over the cake so drop through that. Drop down 
the right side, too. Go up the center ladder and UR and UL. There's a false 
drop at the top--take it, go down and go UL/UR.

Getting to the inner sanctum is not too bad because you can retreat to below 
the cement and dig a bunch of holes and go 1U on a ladder so the enemies 
really are trapped when they drop. Then you can clear that out. Now remember 
to get the gold in the DL--if guys chase you, dig them up. Nothing should be 
left, but search if there is--you can use the very outside diagonal ladders 
to get anywhere you want and then drop down.

To get to the level ladder at the top, similarly use the outside ladders. 
Enemies may be in the way, but use the start button to map where they are and 
go up the way with just one enemy and dig one hole so he won't regenerate at 
the top and block you.

You should be able to shield bad guys from the left in this butterfly shaped 
level. Just go up right away and fall left and go to the top. Dig right and 
fall and, first, dig over the gold on the 1-ledge.

Next time to the UL, dig and then fall right once and dig down. But at the 
bottom gold, 1L and dig right and get the gold and 1L and dig down to land on 
the feather. The next time, fall right twice and dig over the gold right 
below.

The rest is cleanup--the cake on the left. You will want to dig at the 
rightmost part and climb up the ladder, dig-L fall-L dig-L and get gold. That 
clears the left. Run left and dig right 6 times. That should cash in 
everyone's chips--they'll be in the top, but there's a door for this level. 
The right is symmetrical to the left, except for a chute that actually saves 
a bit of time and the low suspended gold(dig 2U and 1U,) so go at it. The 
door's on the bottom row, to the left.

The tricky part about this level is where to trap the bad guys. There is a 
quick way--go R and U and when the crab passes below, keep going right, but 
dig left behond you. Get one of the golds and dig twice to trap the DR enemy. 
Now dig 1L of the 1-ladder to get the gold below and then you can pop up that 
1-ladder and down to lure enemies from the left as they come. You can get 2 
of them in the trap at the bottom.

Now work on the right--beware of the trick chute near the ladder on the 
right. But the rest is easy--UR feather, dig over the gold by the rope, then 
below--and drop from the rope onto the gold on the 1x3., Then go left of the 
rope, fall onto another, and drop on that. You can go to the left side if you 
like as well. Dig over the remaining gold near the left ladder. You should 
also go to the UL and fall right off the rope for a feather the door would 
block otherwise.

That leaves the center. You can attack it from either side but you'll 
probably need to weed the enemy out. From the left:

H1567
H2
H3
H4

Dig 1-3, wait and dig 4-5. Then 4-6 the next time, then 4-7. If the enemy 
gets to the right and is a pest, mirror image this to get the right fall 
right.

The door is on the top, and approach from the UL.

Go left and UL and fall for the first gold. Then go over the top and get the 
feather. Go back up and fall left for one gold. Then go DL and fall again for 
another. Fall left, 1L and fall down. Go R and up the right complex of 
stairs, featuring a feather, cake and gold. There's also one gold to fall on 
on the left side.

Now you can clear out the left--though enemies may fall in some cases. The 
left features gold you need to fall on, but enemies can too. There's also a 
feather. When in doubt you can go DR, dig a bunch, and run left and grab a 
gold or such. Eventually you may need to let 1 or 2 guys on the left fall to 
the bottom so you can fake them out. Then you can run to the UL.

You can dig to the bottom and dig around to get rid of pesky enemies, but 
eventually you'l want to get to the top. Three of the stars work one way, and 
a fourth works the other. I'm going to assume you can navigate the enemies--
leave one alive to chase you if it is too tricky, and remember the left star 
is the trickiest to get to as it has one way up. So take the left stair there 
if you can, but settle for what's available. Dig 0 if you are coming from the 
left. Otherwise just 1-2-3.

Go to the right and up. After the crumbly, dig right and let the enemy follow 
you right before going up the next. This traps him--he doesn't know to go up 
and can't climb/fall down stairs. Fall left and climb to the top. At the 1-
rope dig left, fall 2L and dig right. The enemy will fall into a pit. Get the 
feather and dig over the other one and fall on it. Fall left.

gold(the final.) The door is in the DL.

This requires several trips through the wringer though none of them are 
terribly high risk. Dig right and go up the right. Dig that guy out and L D 
and dig a hole for him--you can also run over him to the right and/or get the 
cake later. But you will need to:

1. dig over the very top gold and fall in, then dig over the gold below when 
the crab is below you going left. Then you will need to deal with the guy at 
the bottom. Do not kill him. You may wish to dig him while in the corner, run 
to the other side and wait for him to regenerate. But if he is in the 
building, he can't trap you on the outside.
2. dig over the feather

you need to get to the center of the bottom of the building--maybe one last 
dig.

Run right to the corner and up immediately. Then climb, getting all the gold. 
The enemies will be on the long ladder to the left. Clear all that out. Then 
you can bring them to the DR and climb up past them--fall for the feather and 
then go to the UL. If one trails you too closely just have him follow you to 
a corner. Killing them risks dropping them in a pool, making the rest of the 
level trickier, so just lead them on.

You need to fake the crab in the pool 3 times:

1. Drop on the right for the + and $. Dig over where the $ was. Land on the 
crumbly. Dig left and get out.
2. Drop on the left for the gold. Dig underf where it was for another gold. 
Go left and dig left so thbe enemy is on the left side when you fall. Don't 
kill him.
3. Dig over the center and down.

You've done this before--wait for 4 until 1 regenerates. The unleashed enemy 
makes things tricky, so you may wish for him to climb up a bit before digging 
through 5 then 6. At worst you'll probably trap him and escape, but if you 
can stick him there and get out, that's less hassle later.

Now go up the right stair and work on the right--you may have to dig to get 
by one guy. Crumblies in the UR. You can take this all on one go if you do it 
right.

1-2-3-wait-4-5, 1-2-3-wait-4-6. Then dig right as you go down the ladder and 
fall right onto the square you can't dig--a crumbly, fortunately. Now for the 
center.

Go up the right stair and dig down twice. Take the stair with the gold below 
it and 1-2-3-4-5 dig as at the top. Again you need to dig your way out. Then 
at the bottom, dig so you can dig left and get around the guy that's probably 
waiting there. There's one more gold. At the top of the left stair, 1R dig-R. 
There should be no special obstacles barring the stairs in the UL.

Go right and up ASAP and dig down 4x to get the two gold. Go up and dig down 
4x again to the left for the feather, then go up and dig right for more gold. 
Go up top and to the left edge to dig right/down to get the gold over there.

Go up the right center ladder and mirror the left--except for the first bit, 
already done. Now you need to goad a bad guy to the UR. But not all the way. 
Drop when he is on the UR rope. You want to be on the right of the hole with 
him on the left. Wait for him to drop and fall on him. Keep trying to go 
right. Eventually you will fall right and you'll be able to dig out the very 
DR gold. Repeat with the UL/DL. Mirrored of course.

For the last bit you need to go to the top and dig the bad guys out. You will 
probably have to re-dig for access to the gold, and you'll need to dig to 
trap and run back over them, but when they regenerate they seem to fall on 
the sides and take forever to get back. So even if a few come at once, dig 
'em up and continue. The door is in the top center.

The first bit is pretty standard. Sucker everyone left. Then go up the stairs 
when they almost got you. They'll be stuck on the left edge. Go clockwse 
around the star and when you get the UR gold, go L U L and fall to thbe 
center. Then clear out the area righbt of the star, falling to the rope. Dig 
don't fall when you get the 2 $'s under the rope--falling right traps you.

But it traps the bad guys too and you'll need to keep digging them and 
killing them until two fall in that area. So get to it. Just stay in the DR 
if you want to be safe. Go back to the UR and dig to the area left of the pit 
where they're trapped. Dig the 2 squares left of them and 1L 1D and they will 
run into those squares to chase you. Then they'll be engulfed, and you'll get 
credit for taking that gold. The stairs are in the UR. You may have a small 
tangle getting back there--just wait at the bottom, dig and run past, or 
outrun them. Your choice.

Go right past one ladder then up. Go left onto the crumbly and then dig your 
way down for the gld to the left. Dig the right of the pool at the top for 
another gold. Then dig for the feather by the right edge and dig as follows:

123X
45XX
6XXX
$XX$

For one gold, and the mirror image for the other in the UR. Go to the DR and 
then go above the pool and dig down for the $/F. When the enemy is in the DR 
corner, dig and fall. Get out and go to the left. Dig up your enemy so you 
can tear the left wall down. Then go to the UL for a gold and dig over the 
entombed gold. You can muck around trying to trap enemies in the top pool by 
killing them if you want, but becfause you can always kill them, no big deal.

In the meantime release the DL guy and go R D as the crumbly evaporates. Go 
left and dig for the enemy, then get the gold he guarded and the suspended 
below. To the DR now. Run right to go over the enemy and leave him a hole. Go 
to the pool now and dig out anyone stuck there so you can get to the door. 
You may have to retreat a bit. Don't entrap anyone as you dig of course--just 
leave them behind--although you can retreat right to dig the last guy stuck 
in the pool.

allow you to get to the left side. Dig your enemies--or at least watch them 
fall, go UL and dig again. Then get to work on the left. You should be able

Go right, dig right and continue that way. Watch for a guy below and fall 
left when he is on the ladder, to get a gold piece. Then go along the bottom. 
Because you've lured everyone right, the left is clear. You'll need to shunt 
most everyone to one side(preferably the right) because you can't dig on the 
bottom where you'll land--with speed you can maybe leave on left for parts, 
like the first dig into the watered 3x3 area. Dig the right square below and 
fall and dig right and fall and go back left and up. Go back to the top and 
dig over the gold on the ledge. Fall left, 1R and dig right and fall. Go back 
around the UR and fall over the feather, dig left, fall left and right.

You will be able to dig/fake the bad guys at the bottom pretty easily(though 
if they reappear at the top, try killing only one,) so next time dig over the 
gold in the 1-pit--crumbly below. You'll fall onto the rope. Fall left for 
the feather. Then loop R U L and fall off the ladder and dig if you are too 
lazy to deal with enemies--the door is in the DL but going directly there 
from the DR might have let the enemies block you easily.

Ducks and water, how cute. 1L, dig right, fall. A chute, a crumbly--go left 
and right to expose the gold. NOW you can dig for the feather. Go to the 
right and dig over the 2x2 area to fall on the feather. Dig left and get out 
and go back up. You may need to shake a guy in the DR here but when you do, 
go across the rope, down the ladder, dig right and fall, then dig right to 
get to the gold, 1L U from the gold, dig left, and get out.

Now for the big duck. You can drop onto the cake and when the crab is going 
left and under, dig and fall. (I accounted for the time to do so in this 
instruction.) Dig 2U/R and U of the UL gold and fall right after you get it. 
Dig the square below and dig from the rope to fall left. Dig the enemy out of 
the way and dig over the feather. Fall, di over the 1-rope, fall right when 
the crab goes right, and dig right and fall. Haste(left) leads to a pit.

But now you can just loop counterclockwise and fall 1R of the UL to get to 
the door 1R.

2 bunny heads. Go up and fall left for the cake. Dig right from the UL ladder 
for one gold then nip in for another before you dig left to get out. Drop 
between the ears(chute) for 2 more gold, digging and falling left when he 
goes back left. The right gold is similar--except the way to get it is 
mirrored. To get the feather, you can drop at pretty much any time, but when 
the crab is at the right it's safest.

The other side requires you to repeat your actions--except there's no crab or 
water nuisance, you may need to shake some enemies(or get them along the top 
and drop them in the left rabbit, or lead them to the DL and then work on the 
UR) and when dropping down the center, you need 2 trips. First dig left, fall 
left, and dig left above the feather. Second, dig right and fall right.

Note you may encounter problems if a guy falls into the right. If so you can 
dig around one of them, i.e.

H1
H2
H3
H4$
H X

Dig 1 and 2, wait, dig 3 and 4, dig 1 and get the $. But you need one of two 
sides to escape to. If he is trapped with a gold piece, you will need to goad 
him to the center, dig both squares by the 1-rope and dig while over him, 
running over and digging behind.

This level has nothing you haven't seen before but the quantity is daunting, 
and sometimes you have to dispose of enemies before the real nusiness. If 
they get stuck in a pit, dig so you can dig them out one way and you can 
run/fall the other.

Dig right before you go up, then run left of the top to fall on the feather. 
Fall left and go up. Stand left of the ladder at the top until your ground 
stops crumbling, then dig left while going down the ladder to get one gold. 
Dig right at the top 2 rungs of the ladder for another gold and dig under it. 
Fall right. Call where you are position A. You'll be returning a lot. From A,

1. fall right for a gold then left. Wait at the bottom for enemies to lump 
there.
2. up, dig right 2x to get the gold, and dig. Fall to position B.

From B,
1. dig to fall on the feather and then fall right--that's a crumbly making up 
the pit.
2. Go right and up and get the UR gold. Then dig over the stack of 2 ropes, 
where you dig L/R, fall L, go R and dig L/R. Get the gold, dig left and fall 
for even more stuff. Dig the right square and you will fall on a crumbly, 
making the 1-pit with the gold less dangerous. Fall left and go up the right 
ladder to get the gold there--dig right at the top first of course.

Go back through A, B and then to the UR for the level ladder.

Dig 1, wait, dig 2 and dig 3. Fall and let the guy come over a bit--move 
right as soon as you can, and he will walk into somewhere where he gets 
entombed. Then dig 1-2-4-5-6-7 to get to the gold way below.

Now the bad guy at the bottom will be trapping the crab into the corner. You 
can take advantage of that to run right and get a bunch of stuff, then use 
the ladders to loop around. In the UL you can vet guys for gold and then go 
2D R and go D/U to trap one in the 2-space. You can trap a second by digging 
while in the corner and going L/2D/U.

That leaves the last bit. Dig over the water gold, below that and below that. 
Stand on the cake. Pause and look below--or just drop on the ladders--after 
getting the gold on the ledge there, and go right and up and get the gold 
over there. Now the enemy may have pinned the crab in the DL corner--if so, 
dig 3L of the near ladder and step back. Then dig 1L of it when he falls in 
so that the crab can go right and you can go left. The stairs are at the top-
-just make sure of no surprises from above.

Enemies may be on top of the phony pony so go from the UL quickly right and 
dig 2 squares between the ladders. Go up the ladder, wait and come down, so 
each enemy is trapped with one move. Your first priority is getting to the 
bottom bit--then dig the bad guys up and dig UR and R of the pony's eye, 
though if you don't feel you have time, save it for last, since the end 
ladder is right there. Fall off the tail below and go down and up to alert 
the guy guarding the feather. Dig some holes for him. Go to the UR for 
another feather. Fall left and run L/U for the level-end ladder.

1L dig right and fall right, D, get the gold and come back up. Get the cake 
and feather above. Dig over the feather right of the ladder for more stuff, 
then fall down the ladder. Now you can dig for the gold 2D2R and go back up. 
You can trap a guy in the DL if you'd like, too. Standard ladder tricks--
bring them left of the rope, cycle and fall go down the right ladder and fall 
down. At the top rope, fall right and dig if a guy or two is coming. With 
them both trapped, fall down the ladder and L-R or they will trap you on the 
cement. Then R all the way-U-L.

For the DR, dig as follows with nobody down there(if you fall there 
mistakenly, you can cut things short to dig them up:)

dig(with nobody to the left):

Go UL and dig right to drop on the cake, then go down. Go to the DL and walk 
across the crab when he is 1R of you. You can get the gold and go down and 
walk 3R across him to get further. Then go up and get the gold and fall left 
when he's right of you. This keeps him cooped up in the DL. Dig your enemies 
as needed to get to the UR and work your way down after that. They may be 
holding gold, so if there is no UL stair to the top, try digging them up a 
bit.

Go right and up for gold and a feather. Drop in the pool and get out. Drop 
over the crab when it is going right, by the left gold. Then dig 1R of the 1-
rope and clear out the DL. Go back into the pool and dig as follows:

X21
XX3
X$4

Once you've gotten this you may wish to dig your enemies up. Then go to the 
DR, dig over the 2nd-left of the ladders, fall on it and dig left. Fall left 
and dig left over a crumbly to get the DR gold. Now you need 2-1 digs for eac 
suspended gold to the left. If enemies come by, dig them on the bottom and 
then continue.

The door to the next level is in the DL.

Go to the top. Drop left at the UR gold and then drop from the top rope to 
the left and zigzag right/left. Dig your way back to the ladder. Go up--
ducking left to dig a guy above--and dig over the UL gold and drop right left 
etc, digging over the cake and going R-L-R.

For the next bit, go to the right and fall down the center, as there is a 
chute. Go right and dig over the feather and dig to get out of there. An 
enemy may have fallen. If so let him stay there. Dig your way out of the DR 
and go back up--the left ladder, actually, so you can avoid enemies.

If you are really desperate to get a guy out of the right structure, dig down 
from the right ladder--you can climb up the left, lose enemies there, and go 
right. Otherwise just drop on each of the suspended golds and zigzag down. 
The door's in the bottom center.

Ooo, numbers. One at a time, bottom bit first.

Dig over the bottom gold in the 5 and fall through. Dig the 3 squares over 
the feather to get that. Get 6's top gold and then dig over the 
bottom(chute.) Dig over 7's suspended gold and then the 5 over its bottom 
gold. Dig the left side of the 8 for 2 more, then dig over and get the 
feather. Dig the left side--top 2--of the 9, then dig over the gold to gall 
on it.

You may need a dig-fest to get to the top, but once you do, dig the 4 as 
follows:

F1
$2
3X

1, wait, 2, fall left of 1 and then dig 3. You can dig 1-2-3 after getting 
the $ if you are worried about timing.

Dig to get between the 1 and the 2 and then go right. Dig over the 3's top 
gold and fall left and go down the stairs. You'll need to fall over the 3's 
gold again--but after digging enemies up, fall left on the 1/2 ladder. 
Eventually you can make it left of the 1--go up and dig right to fall on one 
gold, then

Dig 1-3, wait, 4 and 5. You may have to dig a guy or two at a time to go back 
right, or you can just fall and go right and up to get to the UR level 
ladder.

Dig as follows for the gold column.

Head up the ladder. Dig down once for one feather, then over the other 
feather to fall through. Go U/UL/DL and dig to walk to get the one feather, 
but keep digging below it to get to a crumbly, i.e. what you can't dig. Step 
on it. Now you can get out of that house. Pick up the cake before walking in. 
Then:

H21X
H43$
H65X
H87$

Over, dig a hole on the left for a guy to fall into, and around for a 
mirrored operation for the other two gold.

Getting back to the other side is a bit tricky if you mucked around in the 
house botto, but you don't need to do either. For the curious--you need to 
fall right off the ladders and then drop down and go right to sneak by when 
going DR. Then go down and dig holes and loop back.

the first diagonal for a gold. Then wait so they lump on the left. On the 
next ledge:

X F
$1X

Then go left from the top run and make sure, after 1 guy crumbles and you get 
the gold, you touch both squares. Dig over a feather, and go on the top rope 
and down the 2nd-right diagonal next time. Get the other feather. You should 
now have the time to go U L and to drop on the gold on the top. Then fall 
right to get to the gold below. Remembert to, as usual, jump where the crab 
just was, then fall down right again. Dig your way out.

Now let everyone come to the DR so you can go to the UL. Drop down the left 
diagonal for a god and dig out, then down the top one on the left. Dig the 2 
squares above thbe suspendedgold. The next diagonals have cake and gold. The 
center pit on top has the level door.

cake and run back left. Dig left to get out of this mess. And create an even

you'll clear just as the left, only digging right, not left. Dig left or fake

Cool plane or space shuttle. Anyway, 2L U 2L and dig right. Drop on the gold 
then the feather. Go back there, get the cake and dig to get around the enemy 
coming down. Go L/U and at the top, dig to fall over the gold, 1R, dig left 
and drop left. The next time around, dig the gold in the pit--fall down the 
1-ladder. Then dig over the suspended gold to the left with your next trip 
through the UL and R/D. Dig while over the feather and then be prepared to 
fall left onto your enemy twice as he walks down--run left so you can get on 
the rope. Fall left when it's safe to get the suspended gold. If the first 
time doesn't work, keep digging and eventually someone will get trapped in 
that chamber.

The rest is pretty paint-by-numbers--dig a hole or two and get what you want 
after going to the UL, and watch out for the suspended gold over the chamber. 
Let everyone out before getting that one. You may wish to break only 2 of the 
3 crumblies in the right to get the gold so enemies will still be trapped to 
the left. The exit is on top of the ship.

Dig right and walk across R U R and U R for the feather and gold. 1D and a 
guy will be 4L. 1D and he will fall below. Good start. Then L U L D R U and 
he will come right. When he is just right of a gold, go D L U R and get that 
gold. Then position him right of another by levelling with him.

At the top of this structure, dig and dig left to get ther cake without 
annoyance.

Then dig:

1H
2 H
$3H
~4H

For a tricky suspended gold. Now dig over the top, on the right, and dig 
right so an enemy will drop into gold, but run left over him. Dig right, fall 
and dig right then left. He'll drop to the contained area. Now clean up on 
the left.

Get the left gold as noted before. Then dig the right side and dig the 
rightmost brick, fall right and 1L to the rope. Dig and get the gold and 
feather.

Dig right to release the enemy and fall on him and dig right as you do. Then 
dig left, then right. Get the two gold in the center bit and fall onto the 
rope. Walk over the crab to get the left gold and go back. Then walk in the 
other direction. When the crab goes right, get the feather. It's easier to 
walk over thbe crab when he runs at you.

Now dig the enemy out of the left and goad him to the top. Dig to get his 
gold and go to the right. Stand 2U of the bottom of the right ladder. Then 
dig your enemies out, go to the bottom, and dig them up. You can fake guys 
out pretty easy just going up the center ladder, or you can just cajole them 
into a corner--or even trap them in the bottom of the right as before.

Wait for the guy to fall. Stand on him and dig left. Fall on him then dig 
left again. Fall left and dig left. Run off to the left and dig whomever you 
can--some should fall into the center pit.

You'll need two of them to do so. Fall on each and dig once left and once 
right to get one gold per trip, digging them out so that you can get the gold 
they snagged.

You should also try to get the UL feather--at the top of the ladder, dig left 
and right and fall right and back up 2 squares and dig left. Then run left 
and dig your way to the bottom and go right.

Might as well dig for what you can get first--the UL feather(go UL, drop an 
dig above it and right below it.) The DR cake(walk back and forth across ALL 
the crumblies here to get started) where you can then just dig UL and L of 
the one corner gold and UR and R of the other, then down one ladder for the 
three.

Dig right of the top enemy and right of where he falls to let him out. Get 
rid of him(he'll eventually fall in the right) and then dig R of the guy 
below him, go 2L and dig L and get out. Dig R of where the middle guy fell, 
then fall on him and dig L to release him. Just get his gold--no need to trap 
him. The trip D R U after you get the gold and dig up enemies who have it 
should be easy--there's no way out of the UR pit.

Dig R of the bottom guy to let him out. Kill whom you need to to escape.

This is important to do first as enemies can otherwise get trapped over here. 
In fact you can start to dig to trap the monsters over here now just for fun. 
Some may even get trapped in the left diamonds above, which is just as good. 
You can also get them to follow you up the right ldder before you reverse on 
them, falling left. Meanwhile, you can dig ogver some gold--or to the left or 
right of the entombed--to get to a good start. You can even go up top to dig 
on the 1-ropes for other stuff.

Dig to either side and fall on the crumbly for the gold below. Dig the 2 
squares over the gold below that. Go up the stairs to the right and dig over 
the left gold. Go back up the stairs to the right. At the top, dig left from 
the 1-rope. Get everything nearby. Drop down, go left and up and dig left.

right, fall, dig left over the gold. Next on the left edge, dig over the one 
gold and you'll fall on a crumbly. Dig down again. You can now take care of 
the feather--leave a few digs for trailing monsters.

If you got all 69 goodies you get a bonus stage.

L D R and when you get two gold, dig and fall. Go to the DR and 2 floors up, 
go left and fall through the chute and left. Go back up. Let guys come over 
the top so you can fake them out below and get to the gold right of the crab, 
digging the right wall. Go to the stair top and across the top top 1-stair. 
Dig each way and fall left and go right.

Now for the toujgh part to time. With two enemies lumped together, go down 
the center top ladder. When they are near, go up and dig the 3 squares to the 
right. Run back left, U R D and fall on the other side. 1R. They'll fall in 
the drop you created. One will get wedged in the pit and the other will 
create a walkway to the house to the right. Dig abovge and at the ladder for 
the gold, then dig the left square to get out and get the gold you couldn't 
before, too.

One more thing to do...dig right of the top ladder, down, right etc. Now 
release everyone with two digs right.  Go quickly down/left and dig like 
crazy. Get the gold, which they may have left behind, and drop into the 
crab's area from the UL--dig over the door that is there.

Tricky start here. Go to the DL and go 1U and wait as the enemy goes left, 
then drop him. This makes sure he is right of the crab, blocking them both 
out. Now quickly go up--another guy is coming.

Go to the center square and wait. Dig two guys up then dig over a feather--
chute below and you will go to the bottom. See where the enemies are--it's 
very possible one might drop to the bottom right of the crab, blocking it 
further. Run right and up and drop left through another chute, then pick off 
the chest to the left--important to make sure nobody's coming down the left, 
or if they are, incapacitate them. Then go to the top, getting all gold along 
the way including the suspended one below the edge of a platform. Each time 
you drop down, be aware another guy may fall if you are just patient enough. 
Even if he goes to the DL you can toggle up and down to bring him near.

So just wait at the bottom a lot and when you are ready you can drop onto the 
gold, walk on everone's heads, and go left and take the long walk back to the 
UL(L, U, R U R D R U L U L D L U)

Fall right and go left/right/left quickly for a bunch of gold. The enemy 
closes quickly. Go U R and dig him, then L/U for a gold on the left side. 
Right of the rope, U R and fall. Dig right so that when you land you can dug 
three times. Get the gold below and to the right. Wor your way up, getting 
what gold you can find. Dig your enemies so they appear on the left and can't 
disturb you. Then 3-2-1 dig on the right edge, next to the ladder, to get the 
gold wedged in the right that you can't walk to. From the bottom you can 
easily run U L U L U to the top.

After digging 7, R D and both enemies should fall to the bottom. Even if one 
gets caught you can still work around him. You just need to get up one side 
and wait for one guy to fall off the edge.

Dig your way out and go around either side. Dig over the center for one pair 
of gold, dig for the 2-tunnel below and dig left, fall and go left. Dig left 
at the corner to get out, and now go R U so the bad guys run to the right 
before coming back up top and digging over the other gold column. You may 
have to dig one enemy before you get to the door in the DL but that is 
trivial.

Although this level has all kids of weird structures and two guys nearby, it 
shouldn't be all that intimidating. So dig each way ASPAP and go up the 2nd-
left ladder. At the bottom left get the gold, then

HX$1
HX2X
HX$X

and go right quickly to return up--dig right as you go back to get the gold 
in the K to the right, too. Sneak in for another gold and get the feather at 
the top. Now go back down and to the DL. Let everyone get near and climb up 
and fall right. That's two ladders over. They're trapped on the left.

Now all you need to do is go down and get the gold to the left. Then go to 
the top and get the cake and go down for the gold on the left. Go up and fall 
right again. Then go down and left--there's a crumbly 2U of the suspended 
gold. Dig right while on it. Then 1R and dig left. Then you have another gold 
right and down in a niche. Go to the top again, get the feather, and go down 
2 flights and get the suspended gold as before. Then when you land on the 
crumbly, fall right. The rest is cleanup--dig the left of the top H, then 
stand on the crumbly below in the left of the bottom H, then get the 
suspended gold as previous, digging on the crumbly. Then go right and up the 
new-level ladder.

Go left, dig left to trap the guy and dig over the middle of the golds. Go 
counterclockwise and a guy should come to the bottom. Dig him and go up and 
dig over the gold just below to fall on it. Then go down the ladder to the 
right. Then fall through the trap. Go down the right ladder and grab the rope 
in the water and run to the suspended gold when the enemy comes back. Then go 
to the left and run right when the bad guy runs left. Now dig each side wall 
of the pool all the way down to sneak in and get stuff.

When the crab goes back to the left area, dig the UR of the inner bit and 
fall to the rope on the right--go right quickly as there is a crumbly. Go 
right of the pool at the bottom and dig the guy who got the gold out. 
However, wait for the top hole to heal before digging the bottom or you may 
have two guys to deal with. The guy to your right may have a chest so make a 
hole for him. Go down the big ladder to the right, dig your way out, and dig 
right so the guy on the far right gets stuck--but late enough so he doesn't 
die and regenerate. Go right and up to complete the level.

Dig left and drop right away. Go R U and loosen the three crumblies 
restricting the crab. Then do the same for the other side, first going to the 
left side to loop around your enemies. Get the UR feather and the gold below 
it. Then dig 2-1 for below it. 2-1 dig over the false brick, where you dig L 
and R and fall right and dig those two squares below, then get the DR gold. 
Then dig and drop over the suspended feather at the top.

With the bad guys stuck on the left you can push to the left slowly. Drop in 
the culdesac with the gold and dig and this time go left and up. Dig over the 
feather further left and go left for the next gold. Take the rope back right. 
Stay in the DR for them to reach you. Go U L and then dig to get in, wait, 3 
seconds, dig over the 1-ladder and return. Then dig the entry block.

Ooh. Kitty cat. Go left. Wait for the enemy to go left. Then go down and get 
the cake. Drop onto the feather and dig onto the next gold. Drop onto the one 
below and there's a crumbly. R dig-L L R dig-L. On the next 1-rope, dig right 
and fall right all the way.

Then drop into the next big area to the left. Dig left of the 1-pit. Goad the 
guy at the bottom right and up and left. Drop him in the big pit and dig down 
the left column next. Dig left over the next gold. Back to the UR. You can 
only trap one guy in the left pit, so get above the 2 1-ropes and drop when 
another guy can drop 4L of you.

Now you can just it the left hard. Dig 3R of the gold in the water. Dig U UL 
L of the ladder. Drop over the feather(2 false bricks) and drop into the 
water. Dig over the gold below and fall. There's a crumbly to wait on. That 
should be it; go to the UL.

Go up the right. Drop off the 1-ropes and then go left to pick gold up--dig 
enemies too as one will be carrying. Go to the UR and drop left. Then dig the 
right of the 2-platform and go down and UR and L. Dig guys to get to the 
left. Nobody will fall in the critical area as the rope above takes care of 
that.

Drop onto the 1-rope in the pit and dig one way. Dig below the gold after you 
get it, then dig left at the rope below. Get the cake and return but this 
time dig right. Fall and dig right of the crab's path and then go right, get 
the gold and go left--no need to dig yourself out. Now dig your way right. 
You could escape, but I recommend digging over the feathers and dropping 
down. Dig right when the crab's at the right, fall and dig left to get out.

Break to the left. Now no matter wyat you clear from the top it'll make a big 
pool. So just dig the walls to the 3x3 pools to get the feathers. Dig the 
wall left of the crab and walk in for fun stuff and repeat on the right. Dig 
into the O, then go to the DR and briefly to the bottom and up to shake a bad 
guy out of the DL.

Drop down each top ladder to zap the crumblies and then dig to the sie for 
each one to get to the ropes where you can dig over gold--2 of these on each 
side. A bit tedious but not dangerous. Though on the right you have to be 
careful of getting pinned in. Dig when right of the ladder and then go left, 
or dig again as need be.

Now take off for the UL.

Dig 1D and 2D of your start, then dig left so you can dig UR and R and 2R of 
the enemy. Then run on him (start when he is 1/2 over the way down) to get 
the next gold. Dig 1 guy below, 3 below that, the 2 left and run right and 
back to activate a crumbly. 2-1 dig to get down and out.

Go up the right ladder and dig the cake and feather out.

Then drop into the pool from the left(via the top rope) when the crab goes

another(leftmost). Go back up and wait for a guy or two to fall in the pool 
before you drop from the center. Dig for the gold and feather you missed.

Now go to the UR and dig for the 2-wide of gold. Dig over the 1-rope below 
and then

  ~

$234

Step on the gold and go back right. That's a crumbly. Go back into the pool, 
digging 1R of the right rope and 1D of that. They'll fall, but one to the 
right hole and one to the left. Release the right hole guy and take his 
treasure after you fall and dig. The door should be just left.

Go to the top and fall down--onto each of the golds right of the 3-wide at 
the top(fall right on the right one.) Then dig into the pool with the 
feathers and dig left to get out. That clears the right.

Now fake them to the DR and from the UL fall 2R of it, 4R of it and onto the 
other pool to dig into and, when you are done with that, you can wait level 
with the well with the 3 pits. You may have to drag another guy over and drop 
him in the well, but once all 3 are in the pits you can proceed.

In the well, get the two golds you can. Then dig the squares between the left 
and center guys and then the left one. Wait and when you drop, drop left. 
Drop right before you reach bottom and run right. For the guy on the right, 
just dig right when over him, then fall on him and fall right.

One gold may be left behind, but you can dig as follows for the left, 
mirrored for the right:

X$1X

The tricky part was getting the suspended gold. Level stairs UL.

Dig he bad guy. He falls down the center. Dig left, fall on him, left and 
fall, and left and fall twice more. Then dig right and fall and left and 
fall, R and L. Wait for him to fall and then run 1L and right a bunch to 
dissolve the crumblies so you can get back left.

Kill the guy again and this time L L before alternating. Then down the 
center, RL etc. Then RR and alternate, then RRRR and alternate. Just don't 
let him escape down the side. Trap him again as you don't need him any more. 
Actually, dig left when above him to make room for the next sucker.

Who you will get with a 4-3-2-1 down the right of the UL block. Dig left at 
the 1-rope and he will fall. Then go back to the UR, dig right for the guy 
stuck at the top, and 4-3-2-1 as mirrored before. Dig to get the guy out and 
take him out later. Go up the right side to win.

Go to the first rung of the UR ladder so that a bad guy falls into the lake. 
Repeat with another bad guy--sucker him right and go back DL. Now clean up. 
Take the stuff on the left and in the UL, dig the top 2 squares and those 
right of the ladder. In the UR, dig from left to right and top to bottom. Dig 
2L of the lake and fall and fall right. Go back to the top and dig 2R of the 
lake for another gold. You may need to go up the UR.

Get the gold at the top and dig over the cake. Drop and dig right. The two 
guys will fall into pits. Dig to get one feather and dig on top of one enemy-
-go to the left, since if another guy falls in the pool he'll go right when 
you dig him out. Fall on top of the enemy and run to the edge and dig--a bit 
safer than to fall 1D and dig the way he didn't fall. Go left and dig out of 
the mess. Get the feather and dig down, then dig the other guy out. Go to the 
UR to escape--the crab may pin the guy at the bottom against the left, or you 
may have to look before you cross.

This maze level is not particularly tricky. Get the gold at the bottom and go 
up the left ladder 4 so the enemies lump together. Get the feathers at the 
top and fall right. Clear the two golds below. Go back up to the top of this 
area, right, down, dig right and fall left right. Dig once to get the 
guardian's gold but don't kill him. Back up and fall left.

Dig back into the main part and now you can kill whomever in your quest to 
get the remaining golds. None are tricky--dig over the gold in the pool so 
you can run left of course. Even if 3 guys make it right, go down the ladder, 
dig fall left right and go right into the door.

Nothing too taxing but exact play is required in parts.

Fall right immediately. Go up the stairs. Go right and you know the drill to 
take care of the compartments each side of the ladder--delay to dig the 
bottom, then back up and over. Go right first, then left, after which you can 
dig and drop down for the gold on the cement.

Get the cake at the bottom and go to the top. Wait and let an enemy come by, 
then dig and run to the UL and down. Even if he follows you, dig as follows.

Dig below to trap your enemies. Go up the ladder and run back left on the 
cement to fall on any guy going down. Hold right so you can get to that area 
under. Dig 1L1D of the rope and 1L2D. Get out and go up the right ladder or, 
if nobody is stuck down the slide to the right, dig up a bunch of people 
first.

Dig to get at the 4-row of gold from the side. Then dig left so you'll fall 
down the left side of the pool. Fall pretty much any time but when he is 
facing left is best. Dig your way out and go back up. Let the enemy follow 
you so that when you go down, dig left and go right and fall left to dig the 
one guy, the other is not too close by. Then go up the left ladder.

You should just make it as you fall. Now fall into the left part of the 
center for stuff. Dig out 2-1 and fall onto the left crumbly pillar guarding 
the crab next time, when the crab touches that pillar, so you can drop on the 
crumbly below and fall left making two trips instead of one. Dig right for 
the gold below.

Now take care of the right side, going right across the bottom--3-2 dig so 
that when you fall right you can dig right to entrap an enemy. Mirror the UL 
for the UR. Dig 2-1 over the gold to be able to dig left twice if you have 
to. He can drop back in the pool now because you have more space. Drop on the 
right crumbly guarding the crab and if the enemy is to the right, wait around 
and get the gold and dig. Otherwise, just fall off the lower crumbly and dig 
out.

That should be it. Stairs in the UL.

regenerate above the pool. With the level ladder in the center, go up it and 
walk over the crumbly to let everyone escape. Run back right and fall off, 
then start going left. Try to get guys to chase you DL. Get the feather and 
if you can make it right, great, but if not dig left and dig your way right

With all the crumblies there are lots of ways to mess this level up and have 
no way to get a cornered gold. Wait for two guys to be chasing you--one comes 
down the center ladder you want to climb--then L U R U(center ladder) L and 
fall over the gold in the walled off area--dig the three bricks at the top 
and get the gold below. Above the ladder you have two crumblies. Dig left on 
eack one, then go left from the ladder and drop down it and go right--there's 
a crumbly under the feather, so be sure you've got it before you stop going 
right. You may have to be a bit right of it.

ow for a tricky part. There are crumblies above the ladder and you must dig 
quickly left/right, then fall, then dig left/right and fall. Then dig L/R to 
the side of the ladder, and take care of enemies by digging holes for them 
too as you go into the corner. It's important you dig left first--dig right 
first and you lose a half-second getting out.
</pre><pre id="faqspan-4">
You can go to the DR now. You can shield yourself from the enemies as you get 
the stacked gold and then dig for the zigzag gold...go back up the right, L 
and 1U. Dig your way out and go up the center stair--make sure someone's up 
the stairs right of you--two may mean trouble. Note that if both get trapped 
in the left you can dig them outby digging by the rope and digging 2L of the 
top laedder, then digging the right wall. Run right over the crumblies and 
find the feather. Then fall on the 1-block and the enemy will run at you and 
drop in the hole.

Dig 1 and 2, drop in, dig 3 and go right, then dig 4 and 5 and go right. Go 
left when he falls off. Trail back right before digging him up. Now you can 
cut in at the sides to get treasures, and dig over the crumblies blocking the 
crab. Land on them when the crab is touching them, then go off to the side(if 
you feel risky you can get the 2 gold after crumbling the 2nd--just drop when 
the enemy is 2 squares away to make sure.) With both gone, it's eas to get 
in. Up the center stairs and you win.

Go left and up, then right off the rope. Go up the top 1-rope and down the 
ladder for the feather. Fall left onto the crumbly. Now dig each square below 
it, getting the gold to the left when you can. Go to the right of the bottom 
and dig and go R-U and dig 1U1R and 1R of the encased feather. Get the one 
below and mirror what you did on the left. Go back up the right and dig 1L of 
the piece of cake. Dig again and drop below. Dig above the right gold in the 
pool. Drop when the enemy is running right under it. Go back around then dig 
over the other gold and fall on it when the crab is on either edge, then 
quickly dig your way out.

Go to the left and up for the final gold. Dig all in your way. Walk over the 
top gold--chutes galore--and fall into the pool. Fall by the crab when he 
goes back right and dig right and fall. The level ladder is UL.

A rough introduction to the fifth world, which should be the toughest, 
but...whew. You must complete the right before you open the waterways, or you 
will be too slow later.

Dig the 2 squares to the left to unleash the enemies. Fall right for the 
feather and fall back left so you can run over the falling enemies. If you 
don't you're toast. On the 1-rope, dig right and wait a couple seconds. Dig 
everything below so you have a way back after you fall right off the 1-rope. 
The enemies won't escape, so just go left and dig and get that guy out of the 
way.  Get the gold on top if you want but the next bit is in the left after 
you trap the enemy. Pay attention--you'll have to do this to the other three 
guys first.

Dig the top 5 blocks and run left. Crumblies except for the left edge--dig 
that, drop on the crumbly, dig left and run back right. More crumblies. 
Repeat until you have the ladder 2 below. Then you need to step all the way 
to the left. Dig the hole to get below and then walk out with the gold.

Now you want to dump the enemy back in the pit where the two started. Go up 
the big ladder and let him follow you closely right. Fall right, 1L and dig 
right. Go L D R and wait. He'll fall in.

Now dig everything below the 1-rope as before but let enemies come right. Dig 
a couple holes to check them for items if you want and dump them in the pit 
too. Get the two suspended golds by demolishing everything below the 1-rope 
and going R U L and digging L to get them. Then go back. You can also get the 
feather this way, or you can get it digging your enemies out.

Dig them out as at the start and run over the third trapped one if there are 
any gold pieces remaining. They're stuck either way. Now dig the left side of 
the wall in the center, and step on the crumbly. Repeat for the right side. 
Now the crab is going places.

Here is how to complete the left--

H17
H2$
H3$
H4$
H5$
H6$
H8$

Dig 1-5. When the enemy is above the $ dig 6, go up, dig 7/1, dig 8 below and 
come back U R and fall through. You need perfect timing here, so have moves 
planned in advance, i.e. hold down the next dig while moving and vice versa--
when going down to dig 8, though, wait til you're below 2 to hold the button. 
You'll just make it through. The right is mirrored but you don't have to 
consider the crab so much. Stairs in the center up.

Nothing's esoteric here though regenerated enemies in the wrong spot can trap 
you.

Go up the big stair and to the left. Up left and fall and dig 1R of the 
feather. Get the feather and dig down. Dig out, ack up and dig right and U 
and fall right. Fall right again, dig twice to get rid of your enemies, and 
back up and to the left edge this time. Dig for the gold on the left edge(UR, 
R) and the 2 DL gold(left of them). Get the gold right of the ladder above 
too. Dig your way back right as before.

Go U L U and dig over the one gold and go back right. This time you may be 
able to get the gold to the left of the 2-ladder. Dig right twice then left 
twice. Go up again but dig left to get in the area. Dig over the suspended 
gold--then return and dig 1U1R of the remaining gold to get it.

In the UR you can dig into that square easily and fall to the DR, which is 
also easy. Then run DR and fall. Get the feather, dig-drop-dig and now get 
the gold in the UL pool. You've worked your way back R and to the UR before 
so I won't coach you further.

U>>R
Digs take precedence, can hold down 2 at once

Get the cake to the left and go up he stairs Dig to get the 2$ on the right 
and dig left to get out after the crumblies fall. There's another 2R of them. 
Fall on it and then L dig-R fall and get the gold. Dig right and fall again--
dissolve the crumbly to get the gold you couldn't before(false brick to the 
left.)

Back up the stair Dig left on the 2nd-top cement. You may wish to dig a bunch 
of guys before this, but if you time things right you can sneak out. Fall on 
the crumbly, then dig below it and the resulting gold. Noww above the two 
$'s. Dig and get 'em both and dig left after the crumblies vanish. Go down 
the ldder and dig left twice if there are guys--only then get the gold and go 
to the bottom where you may have to dig again.

On the left edge, dig out the feather. Go up and right for the gold. Run to 
the right. Dig up whomever you want and then dig the 3 left squares at the 
top--all over crumblies--before digging

Now go right of the pool on the top. Goad enemies out of there and drop below 
the crab. Dig if an enemy dropped to the bottom--there's a crumbly guarding 
the crab(and the guys in the center pool) if you need to bring a bunch of 
guys out. Below the gold you have a crumbly and then you can go the DL corner 
for the door.

Some of the ladder-shifting can be accomplished by just digging around, so if 
you're having trouble goading them, just kill them and see where they re-
form.

Another level that is more amess than anything. Hold UR and go to the top. 
Drop left--crumbl, feather. 2-2-1 dig over the gold to the left(2 false 
bricks) to get to the bottom and go 2 big ladders left. At the very top, get 
the feather, waterlogging the board. Then 1-2-1 dig to get to the gold and 
fall to the bottom. Go R 2U L. The left column f blocks is clear. R 2U 2R 
fall(crumbly back left) and drop above the feather before digging above it. 
Drop down then go L U. At the top, 1R and fall and dig right. Drop onto the 
suspended gold.

Now go into the DL and dig the first guy, then go right and up to the top so 
everyone is going up a separate ladder. Dig right and fall down the 2-column 
and 1L and dig right again. At the bottom dig left and right. Go R U and at 
the top, get gold. You should have time to go back down and right across a 
3x2 brick block. Now the gold is all right of you, the bad guys left.

Erase the crumbly at the top to get the feather in the water, then get the 
gold in the niche and dig below for the cake. Next ladder over, get another 
gold in the niche and up top. 1R fall on crumbly dig right fall right.

Go down and fall right for a gold and go up the next stair. There's gold in a 
ledge to the left and right. Get each, dig below where they were and fall. 
Now you can just dig over each suspended gold. There's one more gold in a 
niche in the far right. Go up and wait at the top ladder rung--bunching bad 
guys together so you can run down, 2 ladders left and up to the next level.

Go to the right ladder, dig the guy coming down, and go up. Then on the D, 
dig him out of the way. Dig the right two blocks on the N til you can get the 
gold there. Now take out the D.

Drop onto the gold. Then drop onto the gold on the other side similarly--when 
the guy is right below. 2-1 dig then when the crab is under the feather/cake, 
fall.

Dig your enemies out of the way to get to the DL. Tougher than it seems with 
alternating cement and you may need to dig guys coming from the UL too--
eventually you can dig and kick the guys to the right if nothing else, going 
up a ladder 'til they come down. Go to the top and dig 2 squares down and 
keep at it 'til the bottom, where you should only dig one to get the 
suspended gold...of course, get the gold to the right when it's there, but 
don't trip a chute. 2 on the first ledge, 1 on the 2nd. Then dig over the 
2nd-right gold and the rightmost (fall right and go left after this). Then 
dig 2-each down, this time digging 2-1 over the remaining gold.

Go to the UL, wait and fall right at the bottom and go up. Carve up the N as 
follows(beware of regenerators at the top):

Drop down b for dough. Dig up the left side of the N  (2 squares, drop, etc.) 
til the bottom whee you can dig right for suspended gold. Then fall into the 
N from the top. There's a chute. Dig guys out of he way to make the N/D part 
clear. Then do the 2-dig thing to get each of the golds below the N, changing 
to a 3-dig when you can for the one on the left.

2-dig right down the D. Now go left and dig some holes and go right for the 
feather. By the time the enemies regenerate you'll find the door in the 
center.

Get the DL feather. Kill enemies at will and clean off the rest of the 
bottom--first getting the feather under the pit. Enemies will all fall into 
the 3-pit with the ladder above--allowing you to walk on the ladder. Just 
stand left of the pit, top rung, so everyone falls in. Walk right when 
everyone's trapped, and dig for the 5-row of gold. Go to the UL across the 
rope. The next part requires exact play so hold the controller diagonally and 
hold down the digs you want to perform.

over each gold in the UL and then grab the suspended gold--for the UR one 
below the ropes, go to the bottom and back to the top. That'll make a 
footrace the enemies can't win, and you can get to the top, too.

Now take the rope to the left edge and wait. Go U R(across 2 long ropes) and 
D and you'll flip the enemies to the left. In the building left, dig the 3

Go UL and right across the rope. Dig the UR guy out and then dig a hole for 
him. Stand on him and dig right. Fall right and he'll fall in a structure. 
Get the gold and dig down. Go UL and fall on top of him.

Dig in a zigzag, getting the goodies as you go down: right left right loot 
left. Kill him for his gold. Release the guy in the compartment below and 
land on him and do the same digging. Then kill him.

Now release the bottom guy and dig him up for his gold. Dig to get to the 
bottom, then R and U the level ladder.

This is a definite scuba level. Wait for your enemies to fall left before you 
go dig left and go up the right. You'll take care of the right first--you 
can't kill any enemies or they'll fall in the pool and that will trip you up, 
and digging 2 and running over is tricky. Dig into the pool and go right and 
get the feather before you dig left. Now dig over either the cake or feather 
to get it and the gold, then dig down. On the right edge below,

When the guy falls, you fall in and dig right as you go left. Then fall right 
and dig him once and go up the stairs. For the rest of the level, dig ONCE to 
get by the guy before entering thbe pool. Pick off the feather in the right 
and the right side of the pool before serious business.

Dig 1-5(falling right to dig right) one trip, then 1-6. Next time in the 
pool, cross over to the left. Dig out of the way and if you can, get the two 
guys to fall in so they can walk out--usually this means the lead guy needs a 
square bunker before he falls. Delay the second dig a bit if you want. Dig 
over the right of the three remaining golds when at the top so an accident 
doesn't matter. Break down the left wall and get the two suspendeds as on the 
right. The door is below. Don't let it hit you in the butt on the way to the 
next level(just wanted to say that.)

Dig right, go left. Go to the UL and land on the middle (chute) brick. Stand 
in the UL(or 1U of the DL and move up) and wait for two guys to follow you, 
go over the top and cross the right rope. Drop so other guys will drop in the 
chute to your left. There's no gold for them to carry in there, so don't 
worry. You may need them to chase you twice, but once they're inn place you 
can walk for the gold left of them. Trap #3 the same way. Just position 
yourself so you can dig right and get out ASAP.

A good start is critical here--fall left ASAP so a guy does NOT fall in the 
middle hole. If all goes well one will fall in the right and the other below 
two ropes. Go R U. Dig 1U1R and 1U2R of the entombed gold and fall left and 
go left. 1 crumbly and you fall through a chute. Dig right and fall. Another 
crumbly. Exit at the bottom. Then dig 1U1L of the entombed gold and go L as 
the crumbly dissolves, then R and dig left.

On the UL O, dig 2-1 to get to the gold below and dig out the crumblies. 
Below the big UL ladder, dig left 2x so you can get the gold and dig under 
it. On the feather, dig the crumbly. Go back to the UL and from the UL 
ladder, dig left down 3x so you can get the feather, then dig for the other 
feather. On the next trip up, loosen the right part to free your enemies--dig 
2L, 1L1D and 1L2D of the upper rope on the right. Then dig a bunch of holes 
so they get trapped again. Take your time.

Now to get the UL cake. Dig left on the UL rope, fall, eig left, fall left 
and dig right. Get the cake and dig right and dig over the gold and fall to 
get it. Now go to the UR to win.

For this you need to lead bad guys to the top and then drop them into the 
pits on the top and dig them right, go left, and fall right, etc. You can 
take a mulligan to get a feather and work your way down. Note that 

1. Enemies tend to fall left at the top after you drop
2. You need to fall back right after the enemy falls right--otherwise they 
may keep going right. You want to clear each diagonal of U's with one fall 
from the top.

You should drop when they are right next to you, and you can trap all three 
first and then release only one at a time to make things easier. Enemies may 
also fall in the lower pits and that requires extra time but if they found a 
way down to the pits, you can too. The only way to trap yourself from winning 
is to leave a guy in the bottom center pit.

For the left feather, dig the UL fallen guy out to the right. Move left. 
Repeat. Then dig over the feather. Go back up the rope and fall between the 
left two and fall right and continue. For the right feather, just pick it up 
after the guy falls to the right and goes back in play. Same concept for the 
cake and bottom feather.

Go right and up. Loop for the gold. At the top, drop onto the left of the two 
golds and dig down. Dig left immediately and drop left. Crumbly. Dig below it 
to get the gold. Do the same for right of the ladder. Then goad the enemy 
left, dig a hole and run down the right ladder. Stay in the middle of it so 
the enemy falls in the newly made pit. Then clean out the right--again a 
crumbly UL of the gold.

Dig down to one of the compartments below for gold. Go back up to the top and 
drop on the other gold, then to the other lower compartment. Go around to the 
left and fall for a suspended gold, then fall onto the 1-rope above to dig 
the enemy out. Fall on him to get the good stuff and dig left and run right. 
When he falls, 2L so you are on the square that will heal. Drop left when it 
starts to, then dig left immediately. You can get this guy to fall into one 
of the compartments at the top that used to hold gold.

Repeat mirrored for the right side and the door is in the crab's line of 
sight. You should be able to avoid him easily enough.

"Say, what's an easy level like you doing in a world this tough?" Well, ok, 
the last dig is a bit intricate.

You're pretty much forced to go left, but once you do it's easy to pick off 
all six items in the UL. Then if you want, goad the enemies there and take 
out the UR. Now for the center. Go to the bottom and sneak U L D so you are 
left of center for the next bit--remember you can always goad the enemies 
away from where you really want to go.

Dig a 2x3 block on the left, then dig the three below. Run right to the dead 
end, which is a crumbly, then run back. Then dig from the left:

H321X
H654-
HXX 7
HXXX
H*XX%

Run left after digging 7. He'll be trapped by the block from going up the 
stairs. 

5-1-1 dig right of the middle cement(you have time if you go quickly, even if 
enemies are on the right.) He'll move up. Then dig down the left side and go 
1L. He'll run at you. Dig 1L and walk over him to the left. With the crumbly 
gone, he drops down the chute. Drop on him and fall left to get the stuff on 
the plank below. For the last bit, 2-1-1 dig over the 3-ladder at the top. 
Get the gold and fall back out. The door's in the top center.

Another level that's interesting if not especially difficult. Lead the enemy 
up the right ladder, fall and go left. Go up the left ladder and go down and 
right across the guy up against the wall. You'll get the gold. Now U L D to 
the DL and when he goes over 2 squares. go U R D and walk over him. You have 
a lot of leeway with where he is positioned, and if you mess up you can 
always go back to the right. Do this four times. Then dig him out and dig him 
up. Note the guy on the right should stay there as you don't stay on the 
bottom long.

Now you need access to the inside of the structure without being chased. If 
he regenerates near you, stand in the UR of the building and dig a hole. Let 
him fall in, then 5L 4D. He'll go down the right stairs. You can go U 2L D a 
couple times and on the left side, go down and up and dig the left wall. Walk 
in and out. You can now go up/down as needed to drop the enemies in this 
emptied structure.

Go right and up and dig left of the top enemy when the crab is left of him, 
then go left all the way, 2D. He'll press the crab against the left. Fall 
left and go back to the top.

Wait next to the right corner. Dig right, then dig left when the enemy is 4 
squares away. Fall right when he falls in. Get the stuff below and then:

X21XX
XX3FF
$$4XX
XX5

One more to go--the gold in the far left of the crab's demesne. You may wish 
to pin an enemy in the building below first s he doesn't wind up below where 
you need to dig to get out of the crab's water. Dig the hole you did before 
and fall right from the ladder and go left after the crab passes under. You 
can fall on the crab to get the biggest head start, but it is probably not 
necessary. Dig right once you get the gold and fall out. L-U.

Some neat timing and walk-over puzzles here, with even a nasty psychological 
trick about that weird suspended cake. L U R. When the crab pauses, it gives 
you a lot of time to walk over him to the rope. Since you're faster, you'll 
need to wait on him to get to the right edge so you can walk over him. 
Fortunately he takes actual time to turn around. Go up the stairs. Walk 
across the enemies to the rope. Dig left to release them. Wait for them to go 
onto the stairs and walk over them.

2-1 dig to 1U1L of the gold--there's a crumbly L and DL of it. Once you fall 
the second time, go right for the gold and drop over the guy who goes down 
the chute. Hold right to get to the other side.

Dig 1, wait a second, dig 2 and 3, then dig 4 when 1 heals. Dig 1 again and 
get the gold and run back out.

Now get out and go R and dig up the enemies and dig 1U1L and 1U2L of the rope 
and left all the way down to get out. The level ladder should appear. It will 
allow you to drop onto the cake before you exit.

Beware falling bad guys--good timing needed to walk over them to valuable 
gold.

Dig either way--you'll have to release the guy below as there are crumblies 
on each side. Run over both of them and you'll get enough space to run away 
from that guy. Dig below and then get the gold and dig left to get the DL 
gold from that. Climb back up to the 1-ladder. U 2L dig-R and L and, when a 
guy is 1R of the hole, D. Then 2D so he gets trapped in the bottom when the 
hole heals.

Now dig your remaining guy up a bunch and head to the top rope to wait for 
him to fall down the center drop--run over him to get the gold on the left, 
then run back and fall. This might take a bit of time, but eventually he'll 
fall right. Since you're done with him, mirror the trapping above for the 
right--dig in the center, 4R, dig L, R, D, 2D.

Everything else is much easier now. Dig for the 2 feathers at the top.  Dig 
1U1R of the cake, wait, 1R of it and 1U of it. Then dig 1R of the gold and 
get it, then keep digging below that to make a passage in/out for the gold 
below. Dig the top square again to get to the left. 2-1 dig next to the 
feather in the UL, then dig left when non the entombed guy. Hold left o that 
you can run over him for 2 more gold, then dig your way out.

3x2 dig to the right for the gold in the 2-chamber(the row below is made of 
crumblies.) Go U L fall-L and get the gold. Dig a hole for the enemy, then 
dig a hole to fall over the cake. Right when turns right on getting out, fall 
in your hole. Lure him back right and repeat, digging from the left edge, 
then waiting, digging from the right and digging over something remaining. 
Repeat once more. All this fancy stepping leaves the enemy trapped in the 
wide pit. Go right on the 1-rope and there's a crumbly guarding another gold, 
well sort of.

Goad the enemies up the UL ladder after you fall, then fall right and go 
right. 2-1 dig at the right edge for one gold, then U all the way, L for 
another. In the UL, get the gold, dig under, and after you fall through the 
crumbly, 2R to get the others. 2-1 dig over the suspended gold.

Now go 1U of the bottom so the enemies go into the culdesac trying to chase 
you. U L U L U and get the feather and dig right and go up the ladder and 
right on the rope. Make sure any enemies follow you or at least are not on 
the ladder under the final gold--that's where you'll end up. Your task here 
is tricky--to run over the crab. You'll have to inch right 3 times so you 
wind up over the gold as there are false bricks under it. This takes some 
practice and it's better to be too slow than too fast. After you get out, 
fall right. Stairs in the UR.

1-4, wait, 5-6. Then go across the top rope and fall left. Go left across the 
rope and dig left. Fall over the suspended gold to the right, dig left of the 
ladder, then fall over the left suspended. Dig right, loop for the UL gold, 
fall, dig right and fall.

Now dig the 2 squares on the left of the platform and the 3 on the right. 
Fall on the gold and go up the stairs. Dig right and left. D L for the 
feather, right. Go up the center stair to win.

Dig the bad guys up. If/when one regenerates on the side, fall to the ladder 
2 squares in from it. Go down it and, if 2 are on one side, dig before going 
to the bottom. When your guy falls, go up the stairs and fall right at the 
niche--there's a chute. If two guys are still on one side, dig the top and 
bring one guy to the center, then bring one guy 2 in. The point of this is to 
be able to run over an enemy to get the gold that's 1 in and run back.

Dig for the gold/feather on the left. Dig a hole for the enemy if necessary 
and back up the 2-in stair. Then bring a guy over from the right to the 
center. This next bit is tricky and all for one gold.

Drop right to the 2-in stair and climb down, 2R1U of the gold in the pit(2R 
and he falls down the chute.) The guy will fall in but not get the gold. Fall 
onto the false brick and drag the other guy to this area--HE will fall in the 
pit after you go 2R of the gold. Now clean out the bottom--use the stairs to 
duck the crab--and come back to the center. Goad the un-fallen one guy up to 
the top after you release him(2 digs down). Dig him out of the way and then:

V1H
V2H

 X3$

Dig 1 and 2, drop and wait a second, and dig 3. When 1 regenerates, fall down 
the chute and the enemy with the gold will go left and get trapped. Work your 
way back up--the crab will only be trapped on one side if at all--and now 
work on the center bit. You can trap guys by the 1-pit if you want to keep 
them off the sides now--you can eventually trap them on the sides, but be 
warned if 2 others are on the 2-in ladder, the remaining guy can walk at you.

Dig onto the 1-rope over the enemy and go right on the crumbly, then back 
onto the 1-rope. When he falls right, walk left on the crumbly. Dig your 
enemy out to his left, then dig over the left feather. 1L, dig right, go 
right. You need to kill him so he regenerates to the side for the last bit--
and you also need to loop around for that remaining gold in the center 
chamber. When he is on a 2-in ladder, walk over him and go to the top. Dig at 
the end of the rope, fall, dig and get the gold and dig and fall. 

Now you have no great trek to the door just below.

Dig 1, go to 2, wait 3 seconds, dig 2, go up and dig 1-3-4-5. Fall through 2 
and get the feather. Dig 6 and fall left, L U R fall L-fall. Dig the 2-square 
above the 2-stair below and drop left. Dig left as you go right for the cake, 
drop right and go left for the gold, and go right and fall right. You'll make 
it out just in time. Fall right at the top.

Dig the 2 squares left, get the gold, and dig right. Now dig where you fell 
and below that, then dig right for the gold and fall left. Repeat until the 
bottom, where you have just enough time. At the bottom, dig the R-square and 
get the feather in the right and come back. Then dig right and dig the wall 
right of the 2 ladder, get the gold and come back. You now have a level 
ladder up the center.

The gold in the chambers, you've done before. Dig the wall, wait to dig the 
safety, and walk in. But the gold in the pit is different. Go to the top. Dig 
the brick 1L of the ladder when the enemy is close. Go left to 2R of the 
ladder and  dig right and when the guy falls in, 1L, 2R and dig right. Stand 
right of the drop and fall on the guy. Dig right while on him to open the pit 
up, then hold right. You'll miss the gold but can fall right--go R U L and 
you'll just make it to the left fall. Then go left for the gold in the 
corner.

For the next part, go up the big stair and left. Fall on the crab as it is 
pulling into the left and go left. Get the gold with one trip and the feather 
with the other.

Now go to the DL and up. Fall off one rope and dig R from the one below. 
Quickly left and down through the false brick just below. Dig right and run 
over the enemy and dig and fall. Make sure he's out of the way before the 
next part.

Run over the other enemy nearby and dig right and wait for him to fall. Land 
on him then push left for the gold on the ledge. Next make sure he's out of 
the way.

Dig 1. Wait. Dig 2/3. Wait a bit. Dig 1, then 4-8. Now you can go back up, 
dig 3 and fall through.

Dig right, left, dig right. You should be able to get the 2 gold to the 
right. Then dig right over the enemy, get the gold, dig right again to get to 
the side, then dig left over him. Fall when he has hit land, then R D L to 
get space to dig.

Now go to the left without trapping him and trap that guy there. Eventually 
he will fall in the UR where the first guy started. Once he does, take care 
of other business first. Go up top and dig over the top diamond(false brick 
below.) For the cake bit, dig the top row and fall on the ladder. Wait 2 
seconds. Dig L-R. Drop down. Wait 2 seconds. Dig L-R. Dig the UR square and 
fall right and left.

Go up the center ladder and left. From that ladder, dig right and dig each 
square below that, stopping only to dig the squares above the 1-ladder first 
when needed. That will take you to the bottom, and you can go back to the 
center. Go DL from there, just above the cement.

Dig 1. Wait 3 seconds, dig 2/3 and fall left and dig 4/5. 1 should be healed, 
so dig 6/7 to get the gold and dig out. The feather is easy enough to get by 
now, so I won't detail that.

Split the UL into 2 pieces as well. See above for how to get the right gold. 
Then for the left bit,

Dig 1-2-3. Wait and dig 4-5 when 1 regenerates. Dig 1-3 then 6 and when 4 
heals, dig 7 and drop and get out.

Then dig over the enemy to the left, right and left. When he walks down the 
ladder and left, fall and dig right-left. Dispose of him and all other 
baddies with enough digging to put them all in the right. They don't have to 
go to the UR. You're going to look at the DL next.

Go to the DR gold and dig 1L of it, wait, dig 1L1D of it and fall over the 
healed block and back left. Then in the vrey DL,

23X1H
H6 4H
$7$5H

This is like what was above--wait 3 seconds to dig 2, then proceed briskly 
etc. Go up the center and drop whomever you can in the left. In the DR, swing 
across the ropes to dig 4 blocks down between them, then dig right-to-left so 
you can get the gold to the left and fall and go right. Plenty of room for 
tming errors. Now for the last bit.

H1$H3$
H2 H4

Dig 1 and 2, then go to 3, wait 2 seconds and dig it. Fall left for gold and 
retreat. Dig 1/2 then 4. When 3 regenerates, fall right over it. Then floor 
it to the top.

A good level for a scuba outfit. Most of this is just repetition and mirrors. 
But there is a lot to repeat, especially with the maneuver that must be done 
first. Go to the UL and let guys follow you right. Then drop right and you 
can get two guys to follow you down. Stand at the left and dig after both 
fall off the top ledge and then dig to the bottom.

Dig from the 1-rope, drop and dig from the other 1-rope and fall left. Get </pre><pre id="faqspan-5">
the gold and immediately dig the left square and sneak out. Now you need to 
dig your way out and go to the left--dig once to get by the guy over there. 
Then drop right from the top rope. The reason you needed to go left is that 
the guy you trapped in the 3-pit will move left and create what is in effect 
a brick to walk over. Dig from the 1-rope when the crab is nearby, fall left 
and walk left. Dig over the lone brick and run over the guy as he is about to 
fall down, so you can get the gld chest in the center.

Now dig right, drop and dig left. Dig below and get out. Go back up top. Dig 
the left wall so you have a pass left to dig the top enemy out--dig left of 
him and then keep digging the wall down(in 3's now) and then when you are 
level with him, leave him a hole to fall in. Now go to the UR 1-rope and dig, 
drop, dig and fall into the pit. Which has a crumbly below. 1R dig-L D dig-L 
and anoter guy falls. Stand on him and dig right--crumbly again. R dig-L L R 
dig-L and he falls below. Get the chest after he falls and then dig right to 
get him.

A bad guy may leave gold behind, but that is easy to pick up.

You need two guys to clear out the left side entirely, too. But you can dump 
one guy in the right after you've vetted him for gold. And you'll have to do 
everything in a mirror image. The only thing to change is, when you fall 
through the false brick to get the one center gold and dig left and right to 
the bottom center chamber, you have a small puzzle to solve.

For the center bottom chamber: Dig 1. 1D. Wait 4 seconds. Dig 2. Go up. Dig 1 
when you can. Drop down. Go right. Wait 2 seconds. Dig 3 and go U 2L, dig 2, 
U, dig 1 and drop right. Go right and work your way back up. Dig to either 
side to get out of the mess.

The stairs are in the center of the top. Enjoy the Japanese, if you can read 
it, and the fireworks and credits too.

The level below is not featured in the game AFAIK, but it is in memory. It 
doesn't seem particularly difficult and seems to be an odd homage to the 
first-ever Lode Runner level.
