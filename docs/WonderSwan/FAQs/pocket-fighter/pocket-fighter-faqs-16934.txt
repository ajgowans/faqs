-Introduction-

Pocket Fighter for Wonderswan is one of the more valuable games for 
Wonderswan. Not only does it respresent the power that a Wonderswan 
console posses, but it challenges fighting games that appear on more
popular systems such as the Gameboy or Neo Geo Pocket. Pocket Fighter is 
very similar to the Playstation, Sega Saturn and Arcade versions
of the game. All the combos, super moves, control schemes and 
graphical portraits are the same, except now it's in your pocket.
Although the directional pads of the Wonderswan were not designed
in favor of fighting games, it sure does te job and leaves you
satisfied with an aobe average Wonderswan game. Included is a 
card fihgting mode which enhances the experience. Luckily, most of 
the menus are in english, so it's easy to find your way around. If 
you don't have this game yet, it's time to do some searching:).

//////////////////
--|COMBO SYSTEM|--
//////////////////

The Combo system in Pocket Fighter is very simple. Even though the 
combo counter was removed from the Wonderswan version, classic
Pocket Fighter combos with idealistic character animations
remained. If you are not familiar with them just yet, it's real
easy. Every combo starts with the Punch button, then you can make
variations of the proceeding buttons. Also, all full combos consist 
of four buttons pressed simutanesously, however, not all of the 
four hits are successful, since the comp[uter can usually block the 
last one. There are quite a bit of possibilities for the combos, and 
the number of succesful hits very between the characters, but all the 
commands are the same. For example, this is a combo: P,K,P,P or
P,P,P,K . This is a key part in causing some damage in this game.

|CARD BATTLE MODE|
|{{{{{{{{}}}}}}}}|	

Pocket Fighter for Wonderswan was equipped with a unique, but repetative
card battle mode. You accumulate your number of cards every time you 
beat the game. If the difficulty and number of rounds are higher, you get
more cards at the end. I'm not going to list all the cards (maybe when I
get all of them and find time), but I will give a basic know-how of
the battle system, for those who can't undertsnad Japanese.


Cards:

p\k : These are the "combo" or "attack" cards, they have symboles of
       a hand and a foot on it, and a number on the top-left and 
       bottom-right corners. The higher the numbers, the stronger the 
       attack. To make a combo, you need to have four p/k cards avaiable.

special: These are the "special move" cards, it sort of looks like
         a turtle's shell on the image, and has a number on the top-left
         and bottom-right corners. When you choose this card, you can also
         choose which special move you want to do (uppercut, fireball etc...).
         This is where the accumulated cards come i play. If you acquired the
         card, the "special move" card enables you to use it, so you will
         either receive a 2nd or 3rd lvl. special move, or a super.

gem: These are the "gem" cards, they have a picture of a Gem on it. Place
     these before your p/k or special cards for a stronger attack.

UP: This is the "dodge" card. The design of the card is an arrow pointing
    upwards. Place this card to attempt to dodge small combos against 
    you. Also, try placing it before p/k cards for a greater chance
    of success against the computer.

G: These are the "Guard" cards. The design of the card is a big G against
   a brick wall. Use these cards to block the computers attacks.

Pie: These are the "health" cards. They have a picture of a piece of cake
+2   and a number on the bottom. Use them to recover life. The higher
     the number, the more life you will regain.


How it works:
Put together various combos of the different cards listed above. You
qill see that not all cards can go together, since they will be
shaded and inaccesible if they do not go with the card you just place.
Only the player with the higher value of cards set will do dammage
to the opponent, but the opponent will be able to dodge or regain health
during your attack. To have a higher chance of winning, you must not only use
force but strategy against your computer. If the computer hasn't done
a combo in a couple of rounds, it means that his "combo" cards are accumulating.
Therefore, instead of risking doing a special move or combo which is weaker than 
the opponent's, use a Guard card if available. If you have to use a single
p/k card, dispense the one with the largest value (numbers on card). This will be
to your advantage because you will raise the value of your cards during the attack. 
If you are pulling a 4-card combo, the value will already be high enough to beat 
the computer's.
