Digimon Adventure AnodeTimer/KathodeTimer for Wonderswan

INTRODUCTION
This manual/faq is for Digimon Adventure for Wonderswan. Digimon Adventure 
is Bandai's answer to Pokemon. There are various Digimon products available
in Japan. Older games focus more on growing your own Digimon and duking it 
out later. This Wonderswan version focuses on collecting them. You can use
link cable or Digimon-Adapter to battle against another Digimon, but the 
focus is on finishing the RPG part of the game and collecting over 170 
monsters. 
Like the original PocketMonsters the game comes in two more or less identical
versions, anoudoteimaa and kasoudoteimaa. This is the japanese way of writing
anode timer and cathode timer. Every english site mentioning the game calls it
"Another Time", but this is wrong. (They would have used "anazaa taimu")
Kasoudo is also a japanese word meaning Virtual, but that's not what they mean 
here.




CONTENTS

1   Manual translated from japanese.

At the moment this faq consists only of the translated game manual and some 
added details such as the item list. Once you figure out how the game works
you shouldn't have a lot of problems. The only time you'll need to figure out
what the japanese means is at the item menu. Unfortunately you'll use it quite
often so memorizing or writing down some of the japanese names is recommended.
The game is linear and doesn't bother you with complex puzzles so a 
walkthrough isn't included.

If there's anything else you'd like to see, drop me a line.

Story

Suddenly, Milenniamon appeared from the deepest darkness of Digimonworld.
With his eerie powers, he has taken Taichi, Yamato and 8 children prisoner.
As for you, together with the escaped Agumon you enter Digiworld to gather 
your own group of Digimon and fight the others.
You'll have to beat Milenniamon and rescue Taichi&friends.

This Wonderswan-exclusive cart, Digimon Adventure, comes in two versions: 
AnodeTimer and CathodeTimer. Basically the story is the same but they 
contain different digimon. 
Also, using the communication cable you can complete your digimon analyzer.

Button configuration
Y       Not used in the game. 
X       Move cursor or player.
START   Start game.
B       Cancel selection or AI combat.
A       Select.

If you press Y when turning on the WS you lose all data.
Press B+A+START anytime to reset the WS. This will probably work in most other 
games as well.


1.3
Basic game overview

After starting the game you end up in "The first town". There you'll find some 
of the most important places in the game, such as the Server, an item shop and 
the Colosseum.

Two screens above the town square you'll find your first dungeon. Dungeons 
contain enemy Digimon, you'll have beat them all in order to unlock other 
areas of the game and this is also the place to collect new digimon.

If you enter a dungeon you can select a 3 of your own digimon that'll have
to do the fighting for you. Once you're inside the dungeon the battles take 
place on a square battlefield and are turn based. First you get to move, then 
the enemy. After clearing a battlefield move on to the next, until all are 
clear.

When you return to the town you can find any digimon you may have captured in
the Server. There you can add them to your collection and dump any you don't
need.


1.4
The first town

 -Town Square 
  
  Top left house: Tradingcentre. Here you can trade and upload Digimon. You'll 
  need to connect to another WS with Digimon Adv. with the comms-cable for 
  this. 
   Menu: 
   Login > Trade 
         > Upload 
   Install (add received digimon to group)
   Remove  (remove received digimon)
   Exit
  
  Bottom left house: Shop
   Menu:

 -Left of town square
 
  Top right: Battle training centre.
  Menu: Training > Standard
                 > Ground Digimon
                 > Air Digimon
                 > Water Digimon
        Exit

  After playing the standard battle, you don't have to win, the shop owner 
  will show you a "Digimon Battle" device. Here you can battle Digimon you 
  raised in your Digivice/Digibattleseries/Digimonpendulum/Digitalmonster 
  (separately sold, "BattleTamagochi"). You have to 
  use a "Digimon adapter" to be able to connect the these to your WS.


  Bottom left: Leomon Colosseum
  Use comms cable to connect to another WS and battle against someone else's 
  Digimon.


 -Above town square

  Left: Server
  Menu: Receive
        Delete
        Exit
  
  Use receive to add captured Digimon to your group. You must enter a new
  nickname for the Digimon. A little knowledge of the japanese writing 
  system would come in handy.
  Delete is just that. Gone. This does NOT put 'em back on the server.


1.5
Main menu

Pressing A on the world map will present you with the main menu:

Information
Item
Save
Exit

Information gives an overview of the Digimon you carry with you. The first 
screen shows a picture, race and nickname. Select any digimon and you'll get 
a status overview.
__________________________
<Race>
<Name> <???> (Manual doesn't mention it)
<Generation> <Characteristic>

DP Life
AP Attack
SP Speed
PP Defense
VP Variable points
EP Food
UP Unchi (Sh!t)
MP Movement
___________________________

Generation can be something like baby, mature etc...
The characteristic for Agumon is 'reason'.

Pressing A again will take you to the Variable screen.
Think of Variables as magic spells. VP are the 'MP' used in most other games.
Press B to return to previous screens.


Item menu
Use food to fill the stomach of hungry Digimon.
Once you get the Digimon Analyzer (after clearing the first boss) you can 
access it from the item screen. It's a lot like the Pokedex. Check out the 
picture and description of Digimon you already have. The ones you've only seen 
in battle only show their face. You can get a total of 186 Digimon, 170 of 
them can be found in this game.

1.6
Variables
As soon as you enter a battlefield with other Digimon on your side various 
Digimon will start to react. Certain combinations of two Digimon in one team 
will 'unlock' variables (magic spells) in one or both of the two. This 
unlocking takes time, stronger variables take more turns to show.
Variables are permanent but using them costs VP. VP can be restored with 
"plug in" type items. 


1.7
Battle/dungeon
Upon entering a dungeon (if you have more than 3 digimon) you'll get the 
choice between using the same Digimon as before or selecting a new group.
Top choice is select new group.

The battlefield consists of ground, mountain and water tiles. A Digimon has
an element wich is either air, water of earth. Air digimon can fly and have
a lot of movement points. Water Digimon move at normal speed in water and are
slow on normal soil. Earth digimon slow down when moving on water.
Battles are turn based. Each Digimon can use an item, use a variable, attack
or walk. Moving before attacking doesn't cost you AP or other kind of points.

Select the Digimon who's turn it is to get to the battle menu.
Menu: Walk
      (Attack)
      Variable
      Exit

Attack is available if you stand next to an enemy.


If you press A on any other tile you'll get the options menu.
Menu: Status
      Item
      AI > Offensive AI
         > Defensive AI
      Exit

AI does the fighting for you. If you select Offensive AI the AI will also use
Variables to attack.

After dealing with all the enemies on a Battlefield you'll get some items and 
gold and you'll get to the following menu:
Menu: Next battlefield
      Leave dungeon
      Save

If you save the game and load it later on you'll always end up in the next
battlefield.

After finishing the last battlefield (usually the third) you'll be taken back
to the old man.



1.8
Getting new Digimon
As you destroy enemies you'll receive points for the Digivice. Digivice is the 
top selection on your item screen. The digivice is Digimon's version of the 
Pokeball. Using the Digivice on an enemy allows you to capture it. Your chances
increase if you have more points on your Digivice. The manual is very unclear 
about this so no specific details here. It depends on the generation (age) of
the target digimon. It seems you need at least 20, 40 or 80 points, depending
on the generation. And the chance can vary from 50% to 100%
If you successfully capture a Digimon you'll lose all Digivice points.
If you don't capture Digimon with the Digivice some of them will end up in the
server anyway (at random it seems) after the battle is over.

Hints

 1 Where do I go next?
   You can always ask Genmei for help. Genmei is the old man living in the first
   town. Clear every dungeon, go through gates as they open to get to new
   continents. There's a gate at the open field below town square.
 2 Enemies are too strong!
   -Visit some dungeons you already cleaned out. Digimon level up after beating 
   enemies. There is no progress indicator or level counter, but you'll see
   stats like attack and speed increase after clearing a dungeon.
   -Try to capture the stronger Digimon you encounter. 
   -Use the variables! Try different combinations Digimon to unlock new 
   variables, and use them wisely.
 3 I don't get Variables!
   Talking to the residents in town will provide you with useful tips about
   combining different Digimon. Why not keep track of the combinations you've
   already tried?
 4 How do I fill the Digimon Analyzer?
   You only get the complete record if you:
   -Trade/receive a Digimon
   -Capture it with the Digivice
   -Receive it from the Server
