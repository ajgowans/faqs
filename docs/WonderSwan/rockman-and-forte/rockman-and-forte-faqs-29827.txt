 My wish is that this "Ending FAQ" will encourage other FAQ authors to include
 the endings of the games in their FAQs.
 A lot of people actually get interested in reading the ending, even if they
 have beaten the game before.
 So far the only people interested in doing ending faqs are the ones that make
 the Neo Geo fighting games faqs and the ones that do the Capcom fighting games
 faqs, other than those......
 I, for one, am a fan of game endings.

  restored the world to peace. However, the never ending battle continues until
  all destructive forces are defeated. Fight, Mega Man! For everlasting peace!"
  Mega Man starts running home through some scenery. The sun goes down, you only
  see his shadow, and when the moon comes up he is human. He goes through a
  city up to a house. Dr. Light and Roll are there, and Mega Man leaps into the
  air. Then the words "Presented by Capcom, U.S.A." appear.

 1)Number of endings:

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Dr.Wily's Alien.


 3)The ending from the Mega Man Homepage:

  The ending begins when the starry background of the final battle disappears at
  the defeat of the alien, revealing an ordinary room in Dr. Wily's fortress.
  The scientist himself is behind some controls, and a holographic projector is
  moving in the exact formation as the alien had. The alien wasn't real;
  Dr. Wily was using an illusion. The projector falls to the floor, disabled,
  and Wily jumps down and starts begging. Then the scene shifts. The screen
  shows Mega Man walking on a black background, and in the corner is a small
  picture of a valley and a small village.
  As Mega Man walks, the seasons change, as reflected not only in the small
  picture but also by precipitation that covers the screen and also represents
  one of Mega Man's current weapons. For instance, for fall you see leaves from
  the Leaf Shield slowly drifting downward. For winter, white Metal Blades that
  look like snow flakes. Spring: pink Quick Boomerangs that look like petals of
  flowers falling from blooming tress.
  And summer is rain--arm cannon shots that drop fast and steadily.
  Then Mega Man stops. He looks up suddenly at the image in the corner of the
  screen.
  Then the image widens to include the entire screen, but Mega Man is no longer
  standing there. Only his helmet remains. The credits roll after that.

 2)How to get it:

 3)The ending from the World of Nintendo & myself:

  When you beat the final Dr. Wily, blocks start falling from the ceiling.
  Then a block falls on Dr. Wily, then another one falls on Mega Man.
  Then the shadow of Proto Man falls on the block that is on Mega Man and breaks
  it. He says: "Where's Wily?... Oh no. Too late" After that, Mega Man wakes up
  with Dr. Light in front of him. Light says: "Mega Man, you've regained
  consciousness. I found you lying here when I arrived. I wonder who brought you
  here!" Then the Proto Man music starts. Light says: "That whistle... it must
  have been Proto Man!" Then Mega Man starts walking on the grass, and at the
  same time we see the faces of the Mega Man 1 bosses, Roll, Mega Man and
  Proto Man. Then Mega Man looks at the sky, where there is a picture of
  Proto Man. The credits will roll and the Mega Man 3 bosses will be displayed.

 3)The ending from the World of Nintendo:

  After you defeat Dr. Wily, he falls down before Mega Man, presumably begging
  Mega Man to not hurt him any more. Then he stands up, escapes through a secret
  rotating door and all of Skull Castle goes on Red Alert. Then you see Skull
  Castle from a distance, flashing, and Dr. Wily's escape ship flying away.
  The castle starts to explode, and you see Mega Man beam out from it. It
  explodes in a skull-shaped mushroom cloud. Mega Man rides home on the roof of
  a train while some of the closing credits show up underneath.
He arrives home to meet Rush and Roll. Then the screen goes dark before
showing
  all of the eight boss robots and their designers.
  Finally, "special thanks" credits scroll up, ending finally with Flip Top
  spitting the letters "CAPCOM" out his head.

 3)The ending from the Mega Man Homepage:

  After Wily's defeat, the entire ceiling falls down, almost crushing Mega Man,
  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily in one smooth blow. But Mega Man catches the entire
  thing and holds it up. Dr. Wily grabs his chance and escapes. Mega Man can't
  move, and Dr. Light is stuck behind him.
  A whistle comes. Proto Man doesn't actually appear, but you can tell he's done
  something because part of the ceiling blows away, giving Mega Man and his
  creator just enough time and space to get out of there. The next scene shows
  them standing outside, watching as the castle crumbles to nothingness.
  Curiously enough, you can see Proto Man's helmet in the corner of the screen,
  he's standing with them. But right before the screen fades, he simply drops
  off the corner of the screen... The credits will roll after that.

 3)The ending from the World of Nintendo:

  After Wily's last ship explodes, he falls to his hands and knees and says,
  "Alright Mega Man, you win. Sorry for all the trouble. I'll go quietly."
  At this point, Mega Man charges up his mega buster and says, "I don't trust
  you Wily! I gonna do what I should have done years ago!"
  Wily backs up saying, "You forget, Mega Man! Robots can't harm humans!"
  Mega Man quits charging and says, "I am more than a robot! Die, Wily!"
  At this point, an alarm goes off and part of the ceiling falls, pinning Wily
  to the floor. A small piece then bonks Wily on the head. Treble comes down,
  barks, and teleports Wily out. At this point, Bass appears and says, "Too
  late, Mega Man! He who hesitates is lost! We shall return!" Then he also
  leaves and the alarm sounds again. Mega Man teleports out and then we see him
  walking away from Skull Castle as some great music plays in the background.
  Seconds after music starts, Skull Castle explodes in a fireball resembling a
  dragon breathing fire as the credits roll. During the credits, we see each
  boss robot Mega Man faced in the game, along with its designer and number.
  The last 2 to be displayed are Bass and Treble. At the end of the credits, the
  view goes to the sky where a shooting star can be seen, then back down to
  Big Eddy's. Mega Man goes inside and a photo is taken. Beat flies, Rush yawns,
  and Auto(with his hyperbolt in) puts up his fan for the photo, which has a red
  dot like the Japanese flag. The final screen has the Presented by Capcom
  business, with a No. line at the bottom displaying the 1 on 1 fighting code

 3)The ending from the World of Nintendo & myself:

  After fighting Sigma's robotic wolf, you fight Sigma himself. First he is in
  a humanoid form, but after you destroy that body his head lifts up and
  interfaces directly into the Maverick's computer. After X does enough
  damage, the computer short circuits and the whole building begins to
  self destruct. While Sigma is dying he says to X: "No!!! It's not possible!
  I'm a Reploid! I can't be destroyed by you! Why, X? Why have you done this
  to us? Without the humans, my Reploid brothers could have ushered in a new
  age..." Sigma's head explodes and X transports outside. He stands on a cliff
  side watching the island sink into the ocean while a narration starts telling
  us: "The war has ended for now peace has returned. But those who sacrificed
  themselves for the victory will never return. Exhausted, X gazes at the
  destruction he helped cause and wonders why he chose to fight.
  Was there another way? Standing on the cliff, the answers seem to escape him.
  He only knows he'll fight the Mavericks again before he finds his answer. How
  long will he keep on fighting? How long will his pain last? Maybe only the
  X-Buster on his hand knows for sure..." The credits roll while X walks across
  a highway. After the credits, wait a few minutes and Sigma's face will appear
  on screen saying: "You have won a temporary victory, X! What you destroyed was
  only a temporary body -- my spirit remains intact. In time I will find other
  bodies strong enough to do my bidding and I will return. I shall see you
  soon, X. Very soon..."
  The screen fades and the game resets.

 3)The ending from myself:

  After beating Sigma, he says: "Mega Man X, I have lost to you again... Each
  defeat only makes me stronger and serves to bring you closer to your ultimate
  doom! But, something is not right. I... don't quite understand... Why did
  Zero... He is... last... of the doctor's creations... Arrrrggggghhhh...."
  You see Mega Man X escaping the base as it explodes, X teleports outside right
  next to Zero. The game narrates: "Joined by his friend Zero, Mega Man X gazes
  out over the sea. Sigma has once again been destroyed, but X wonders if the
  fighting will truly end. Was Dr. Light's dream of a world in which Reploid and
  humans lived together in peace mearely a dream? The price of peace is often
  high, X thinks to himself. Who or what must be sacrificied for it to become a
  reality? And when the time comes, will he be able to do it? The future holds
  the answers or... "  After that the credits will roll while X and Zero are
  running in a highway. After the credits you will see Zero perform his triple
  shot on the capcom logo (It will be the fake Zero or the real one, depending
  if you saved him or not)

 1)Number of endings:

  2


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Sigma without killing Zero.

  Just beat Sigma with Zero dead.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After beating Sigma in his battle body, he says: "N... No it can't be! I can't
  even defeat you with this magnificent body..?! There seems to be only one
  choice now... I'll possess you!" After that you have to race him up a shaft
  with lava at your heels and Sigma's wireframe head trying to kill you.
  If you live, the game takes over and X says as he runs into a dead end:
"Damn! It's a dead end..." Sigma's head catches up with you and says: "Ha ha
ha.
  Give up X. I'll possess your body and rule the whole world!!"
  -IF you killed Zero before in the game then Doppler comes with the anti-virus
  in him and grabs Sigma. Sigma says: "Aaarrrgggg... You're Doppler...
  How did you obtain this..."
  Doppler says: "How do you feel now, Sigma? Did you like my special vaccine
  for the Sigma virus? X, I'm sorry to have given you so much trouble.
  I know I can never really atone for what I have done... But I will try to
  set things right by taking Sigma with me!!!"
  Sigma says: "My program... is... fading..."
  Doppler says to X: "X... it's... time to say... goodbye..."
  Doppler explodes with Sigma and Megaman escapes.
  -IF you DIDN'T kill Zero before in the game then the one that comes to the
  rescue is Zero himself, he strikes Sigma with his blade and Sigma says:
  "Garrr! You're... Zero... It's you... again..."
  Zero says: "How did you like that, Sigma? I picked up an Anti-Sigma virus
  program from Doppler and used it on my Beam Sabre! Sorry about the delay X.
  I thought the program might be the only thing that would work against Sigma."
Sigma says: "My program... is... disappearing... But... someday... I...
will..."
  Sigma explodes and Zero escapes with X.
  Then you see X standing on a cliff (with or without Zero) and he/they watch
  as the base explodes while the following message scrolls on the screen:
  "X has crushed Sigma's plan once again. But many questions still occupy his
  mind...... 'Why must humans fight against Reploids...? And, why must Reploids
  fight against each other...?' As X stares at the burning remnants of Doppler's
  Lab, his body trembles from an unknown sorrow.  'What does fate have in store
  for me?' He wonders. He can only hope that someday Dr.Light's plans for him
  will finally be revealed. Unknown to X, his destiny has already been decided.
To save mankind, he must destroy Zero. But only time will tell, when and
why..."
  Then it shows X (and Zero if he's around) running on the highway while you see
  the bosses and credits on top of the screen. Then the screen goes black and
  it says: "Thanks for playing, presented by CAPCOM"

  Beat the game with Megaman:
  After beating Dr.Wily you will see a picture on the left of an unhappy
  Megaman meanwhile Roll, Rush, Beat, Eddie, Auto and Dr.Light run
  towards you as the credits roll on the right of the screen.
  Roll says: "MegaMan, welcome home!" Beat: "Chirp! Chirp!"
  Rush: "Wuff! Wuff!" Auto: "You are so amazing, MegaMan!"
  Dr. Light: "Good work, MegaMan. Huh? What's troubling you? You don't
  look happy."
  MegaMan: "I wish I was a little more efficient...Then I could have
  saved King..."
  Dr. Light: "Don't let it get you down. Why don't you show him that, Roll?"
  Screen changes to Roll holding a letter and she says:
  "Here. It's a letter for you." MegaMan: "A letter? From who?"
  Roll: "Isn't this seal familiar to you...?"
  Screen changes again to Megaman and Roll reading the letter while King
  is being shown in the background.
  "The letter reads: Dear MegaMan, It took our battle for me to realize
  that I was wrong. From now on, I'd like to atone for my crimes against
  the people whom I caused such pain and suffering. I pledge my loyalty to
  world peace until the day that faith of the robots is restored.
  If we were to meet again, I hope it will be as friends and not of enemies.
  Your friend, King."
  MegaMan: "King is alive!?" Roll: "I wish him the best of luck."
  It then says "The end", "Thank you for playing" and it shows the number of
  CDs you found in the game.

  Beat the game with Bass:
  After beating Dr.Wily you will see a picture on the left of Bass itching
  to shoot Dr.Wily while Dr.Wily is covering his face in fear as the credits
  roll on the right of the screen.
  Bass says: "Why did you deceive me!?"
  Dr. Wily: "Eeek! Forgive me! I just wanted to test your ability."
  Bass: "What!? What do you mean?"
  Dr. Wily: "I've always believed that you are the strongest robot in the
  world. But you have not been able to defeat MegaMan... So I began to lose
  my faith in you. Then I had the idea that I could create a mightier robot.
  So, I created King. But since you defeated King, I now know the truth...
  You are the mightiest robot in the world!"
  Bass: "What a lame excuse..."
  Dr. Wily: "Bass, let me show you something... This is the plan for King
the second. Join with King the second and together, you two will be
invincible!"
  Bass: "............"
  The screen goes black and Protoman says: "You never learn, Wily!"
  Dr. Wily: "This voice... ProtoMan!"
  Screen shows Protoman destroying the plans for King II and he says:
  "I won't let this happen!"
  Then the screen changes to an image of Dr.Wily crawling on the floor while
  Bass and Protoman stare at each other and Dr.Wily says: "Oh no...
  My beautiful plan...! Bass, destroy ProtoMan!"
  Bass: "............"
  Dr. Wily: "What are you waiting for, Bass! I said, DESTROY PROTOMAN!"
  ProtoMan: "Bass, you don't need to hesitate, do you? You are not a slave
  to Wily, are you? You are acting on your own, aren't you?
  Not with a partner, no under someone's order..."
  Bass: "I..."
  ProtoMan: "You are strong. That is true. But you can't defeat MegaMan.
  Do you know why? It is because you have nothing to fight for...
  What have you been fighting for, Bass? You don't have anything or anybody
  to fight for, do you? You have fought only for yourself, right?"
  Bass: "Silence! Just get lost!"
  ProtoMan: "Farewell." Protoman leaves after than and it's just Bass and
  Dr.Wily in the room.
  Bass: "What I've fought for? That is ridiculous. I don't need a reason to
  fight. I have and am going to fight only to destroy MegaMan!!"
  It then says "The end", "Thank you for playing" and it shows the number of
  CDs you found in the game.

 3)The ending from Jelly Soup, World of Nintendo & The Megaman Homepage:

  -Mega Man-
  Dr.Wily falls out of his machine and starts bowing. The scene changes and a
  message appears: "Mega Man has ended the evil domination of Dr.Wily and
  restored the world to peace. However, the never ending battle continues until
  all destructive forces are defeated. Fight, Mega Man! For everlasting peace!"
  Mega Man starts running home through some scenery. The sun goes down, you only
  see his shadow, and when the moon comes up he is human. He goes through a
  city up to a house. Dr. Light and Roll are there, and Mega Man leaps into the
  air. Then the words "Presented by Capcom" appear.

  -Mega Man 2-
  The ending begins when the starry background of the final battle disappears at
  the defeat of the alien, revealing an ordinary room in Dr. Wily's fortress.
  The scientist himself is behind some controls, and a holographic projector is
  moving in the exact formation as the alien had. The alien wasn't real;
  Dr. Wily was using an illusion. The projector falls to the floor, disabled,
  and Wily jumps down and starts begging. Then the scene shifts. The screen
  shows Mega Man walking on a black background, and in the corner is a small
  picture of a valley and a small village.
  As Mega Man walks, the seasons change, as reflected not only in the small
  picture but also by precipitation that covers the screen and also represents
  one of Mega Man's current weapons. For instance, for fall you see leaves from
  the Leaf Shield slowly drifting downward. For winter, white Metal Blades that
  look like snow flakes. Spring: pink Quick Boomerangs that look like petals of
  flowers falling from blooming tress.
  And summer is rain--arm cannon shots that drop fast and steadily.
  Then Mega Man stops. He looks up suddenly at the image in the corner of the
  screen.
  Then the image widens to include the entire screen, but Mega Man is no longer
  standing there. Only his helmet remains. The credits roll after that.

  -Mega Man 3-
  When you beat the final Dr. Wily, blocks start falling from the ceiling.
  Then a block falls on Dr. Wily, then another one falls on Mega Man.
  Then the shadow of Proto Man falls on the block that is on Mega Man and breaks
  it. He says: "Where's Wily?... Oh no. Too late" After that, Mega Man wakes up
  with Dr. Light in front of him. Light says: "Mega Man, you've regained
  consciousness. I found you lying here when I arrived. I wonder who brought you
  here!" Then the Proto Man music starts. Light says: "That whistle... it must
  have been Proto Man!" Then Mega Man starts walking on the grass, and at the
  same time we see the faces of the Mega Man 1 bosses, Roll, Mega Man and
  Proto Man. Then Mega Man looks at the sky, where there is a picture of
  Proto Man. The credits will roll and the Mega Man 3 bosses will be displayed.

  -Mega Man 4-
  After you defeat Dr. Wily, he falls down before Mega Man, presumably begging
  Mega Man to not hurt him any more. Then he stands up, escapes through a secret
  rotating door and all of Skull Castle goes on Red Alert. Then you see Skull
  Castle from a distance, flashing, and Dr. Wily's escape ship flying away.
  The castle starts to explode, and you see Mega Man beam out from it. It
  explodes in a skull-shaped mushroom cloud. Mega Man rides home on the roof of
  a train while some of the closing credits show up underneath.
He arrives home to meet Rush and Roll. Then the screen goes dark before
showing
  all of the eight boss robots and their designers.
  Finally, "special thanks" credits scroll up, ending finally with Flip Top
  spitting the letters "CAPCOM" out his head.

  -Mega Man 5-
  After Wily's defeat, the entire ceiling falls down, almost crushing Mega Man,
  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily in one smooth blow. But Mega Man catches the entire
  thing and holds it up. Dr. Wily grabs his chance and escapes. Mega Man can't
  move, and Dr. Light is stuck behind him.
  A whistle comes. Proto Man doesn't actually appear, but you can tell he's done
  something because part of the ceiling blows away, giving Mega Man and his
  creator just enough time and space to get out of there. The next scene shows
  them standing outside, watching as the castle crumbles to nothingness.
  Curiously enough, you can see Proto Man's helmet in the corner of the screen,
  he's standing with them. But right before the screen fades, he simply drops
  off the corner of the screen... The credits will roll after that.

  -Mega Man 6-
  Dr Wily falls out of his machine and starts bowing. The scene changes and
  Mega Man is holding Dr. Wily with a rope, then a newspaper shows him in jail
  with the following text: "Triunphant at last, Mega Man arrested the notorious
  Dr.Wily and brought him to justice. Sentenced to prison for his crimes,
  Dr.Wily now rules over a prison cell. At long last, the world is at peace."
  After that, they show each robot alone in its room doing its moves and then
  they are shown in space with their designers name.
  The credits roll and it says: "To be continued..." on the screen.

  -Mega Man 7-
  After Wily's last ship explodes, he falls to his hands and knees and says,
  "Alright Mega Man, you win. Sorry for all the trouble. I'll go quietly."
  At this point, Mega Man charges up his mega buster and says, "I don't trust
  you Wily! I gonna do what I should have done years ago!"
  Wily backs up saying, "You forget, Mega Man! Robots can't harm humans!"
  Mega Man quits charging and says, "I am more than a robot! Die, Wily!"
  At this point, an alarm goes off and part of the ceiling falls, pinning Wily
  to the floor. A small piece then bonks Wily on the head. Treble comes down,
  barks, and teleports Wily out. At this point, Bass appears and says, "Too
  late, Mega Man! He who hesitates is lost! We shall return!" Then he also
  leaves and the alarm sounds again.
  The credits will roll, during the credits we see each boss robot Mega Man
  faced in the game, along with its designer and number.
  The last 2 to be displayed are Bass and Treble. At the end of the credits, the
  view goes to the sky where a shooting star can be seen, then back down to
  Big Eddy's. Mega Man goes inside and a photo is taken. Beat flies, Rush yawns,
  and Auto(with his hyperbolt in) puts up his fan for the photo, which has a red
  dot like the Japanese flag. The final screen has the Presented by Capcom
  business, with a No. line at the bottom displaying the 1 on 1 fighting code

  -Mega Man 8-
  After defeating Dr.Wily's ship, he falls and gets on his hands and knees.
  Dr. Wily says to Mega Man: "S.......sorry! I was wrong! Please forgive me!"
  MegaMan: "...thatâs the same old apology, Wily! Over and over again..."
  Then both of them look up in shock as a sphere of dark energy appears
  for just a moment.
  Dr. Wily: "W... what!"
  The evil energy surrounds Mega Man.
  Mega Man: "Uwaaaah!"
  MegaMan yells in pain as an energy field sucks him and disappears while
  Wily looks on in, shocked.
  We then switch to the out side where MegaMan is laying, close to death,
  in a smoking crater. Duo walks up to find him and examines his body.
  Duo says: "This is not good. he has been affected by the evil energy.
  He will die soon."
  Duo raises his hand and yells at the top of his lungs.
  Duo: "Ahhhhhhhhhhh!" focusing all his energy to one point and touches it
  to MegaMans chest.
  Duo: "If your mind has not completely taken by the evil, then you will
  be safe."
  MegaMan's face contracts into an expression of pain.
  Duo: "MegaMan, I can see into your mind."
  We then see images of all the hell MegaMan has gone through in the name of
  peace. As Duo takes his hand off of MegaMans chest,Mega Man's face looks
  relieved. Duo stands up, holding the evil energy in his hand.
  Duo: "You have been working so hard for justice. With your help, this
  planet will survive."
  Mega Man smiles. At this point, Protoman runs up.
  ProtoMan: "What happened? MegaMan!"
  Duo: "Heâs going to be okay, he will regain consciousness soon.
  My job is done, I must go. I'll leave MegaMan up to you."
  He turns to walk off, but stops.
  Duo: "But, thereâs one more thing...."
  Protoman: "Huh?"
  Duo: "I have.....a favor to ask."
  We then switch to a scene at Dr.Light's lab.
  Roll: "Wake up, wake up MegaMan!"
  MegaMan: "Roll!"
  Roll: "Oh, MegaMan, you're ok!!!!"
  Eddie and Turbo rejoice in the back ground.
  MegaMan: "Am I alive?"
  Dr.Light: "Yes, you are. Duo saved you."
  MegaMan: (slightly confused) "Ahhh....Duo..."
  MegaMan and Rush stand outside on a cliff with a sunset on the horizon.
  Protoman: "Duo is gone."
  MegaMan: "Protoman!"
  Protoman: "MegaMan... I have a message to give you, from Duo."
  MegaMan: "From Duo?? What is it?"
  Protoman: "He said....thank you."
  MegaMan: "Duo... *closes his teary eyes for a moment* Me too!
  Thank you... Duo."
  The sun sets, a picture of Duo appears in the night sky.
  We are then treated to the credits along with pics and concept sketches</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
  of the robot masters from the game AND concept art of robot masters that
  never were. We then get a really freaken cool image of MegaMan, Rush and
  Beat with the words 'Thank you for playing, Presented by CAPCOM' on screen.

  Rush With the base blowing up in the backgound.
  The screen switches to Dr.Light's lab where Roll says: "Welcome back MegaMan.
  Glad to see you made it."
  Megaman: "Yeah. But Dr.Wily got away again."
  Dr.Light: "Glad to see you made it back in one piece."
  MegaMan: "Even so, if things don't change, the battle against Dr.Wily will
  never end."
  Dr.Light: "Its just what you say, but this time we learned what robots need."
  Auto: "Yeah, a hero like me, right?"
  Dr.Light: "Well... not quite."
  MegaMan: "What exactly do robots need?"
  Dr.Light: "Like humans, the robot has to determine what is right and what
  is wrong by itself. Robots are not supposed to hurt humans.
  We need to research more on A.I. program."
  MegaMan: "When will there be world peace?"
  Dr.Light: "That will be up to us."
  MegaMan:" Ok, i'll fight for everyoneâs future."

  to make any more junk robots."
  Wily: "The strongest? You've been beaten by Mega Man before."
  Bass: "I underestimated him that time. But I will conquer him this time."
  Wily: "Yeah right. You can battle with Mega Man all you want. The robot
  I'm making right now will blow both of you away."
  Bass: "Ha! All you make is junk. Do what you want." Bass leaves.

  Mega Man: "I'll keep on fighting for Peace for both humans and robots!"
  Dr.Wily: "Peace for humans and robots? Then why do you destroy my robots you
  metallic hypocrite? Do you destroy them to bring them peace?
  What's the difference between my actions and yours?
  We are so alike, you and I!"
  Mega Man: "Nooo! Can I really be the same as Wily? It's true I destroy his
  robots with no hesitation! I could have negotiated with the robots instead
  of slaying them. Maybe I could have made peace... am I as violent and evil
  as the man I oppose? Am I spreading war instead of stopping it?"
  Rolls enters the scene.
  Roll: "It's not true Mega Man! Don't listen to Wily, heâs just playing
  mind games with you!"
  Auto: "Thatâs right. You're doing the right thing Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war
  are destroyed."

  Your energy system has acquired a terrible defect. Unless it is fixed,
  your body will... and only I can fix your body as I am your creator..."
  Protoman: "Don't worry about my problems. I know my own body better than
  anyone else. And remember, I'm unbeatable! No matter what."
  Dr.Light: "Don't talk that way Protoman, the war is over. Let's live together

  self with no problem. You should go crawl in a hole somewhere."
  Dr.Wily: "You know, I think I regret creating you, pompous robot."
  Bass: "Ha! You created me? So what? If you created a powerful robot
  such as myself, it must have been an accident."
  It shows an image of Dr.Wily creating Bass and Dr.Wily says:
  "Funny you should say that, you're actually right. I studied Mega Man
  hoping to create a similar robot. Then I developed a powerful energy called
  "Bassnium" purely by accident. Thus, I created you Bass.
  Currently, Bassnium is the most powerful energy on Earth.
  But, thatâs not for long. Hee hee. I've learned from my accident...
and i've created a new type of robot which is more powerful than you or
MegaMan!
It'll be some time before I complete this project, though. You better get
ready!
  A screenshot of the silouette of Zero appears on the screen.
  Bass: "Ha! This girlie-looking, long-haired robot will be the strongest?
  Don't make me laugh!"
Dr.Wily: "Don't be so overconfident. This robots power level is far superior
to
yours. And this is more that just a simple robot. With this and my other
project
complete, the world will be mine! No one will be able to stop me! Hee hee hee
hee!"

 1)Number of endings:

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Great Redips.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After beating Great Redips he will say in disbelief: "Impossible!
  Absolutely impossible!
  My... infinite power! This can't be! How could I lose?"
  We next see Redips in his normal form lying on the floor, he says:
  "Are you happy now, X?"
  X: "Redips... what made you Maverick?"
  Redips: "Maverick? You seem more Maverick to me. With all your stubborn
  nonsense about friendship and your unwillingness to evolve.
  Zero: "You don't know a thing about friendship Maverick scum."
  Redips: "Stay in our place, be friendly to all. Decade after decade...
  indefinetly. Is this all reploids will ever be? One day... you'll see...
  we'll...change the world..."
  Now we see a FMV where Mega Man, Zero, Axl run into Ferham who is still
  holding the Supra-Force Metal she stole from Redips. They are all in outside
  in space on a huge piece of the Far East HQ that came lose because of Redips'
  actions before the last battle.
  Ferham with her back turned says: "Don't worry, I'll get rid of this with my
  own hands, ok X?"
  X: "Yeah, ok."
  Ferham smiles and Zero says after noticing the ship trembling: "Huh? X, Hurry,
  we're gonna reach the atmosphere any second now."
  Ferham turns and says: "X? Sorry for all that happened."
  X: "It's ok Ferham, just hurry and get rid of it. Huh??"
  Before X notices, Ferham jumps from the ship into space and says:
  "I'll take it to a place so far away that nobody will find it."
  X runs to grab her and says: "Ferham!" But to no avail.
  X screams and we see the ship getting slowly destroyed by the Earth's
  atmosphere.
  Axl says: "We must close the hatch!"
  All 3 of them go in and X stares into space while the hatch is closing.
  Then it shows Ferham floating in space and she says: "This is how it should
  be... I'll join the Commander and Scarface soon. Farewell..."
  She then self destructs along with the Supra Force Metal.
  We now see Nana in some sort of wasteland, she looks up in the sky and sees
  Ferham's explosion.
  It now goes to a shot of X blowing the hatch open with his X-Buster, Zero,
  Axl and X come out the ship, which appears to have crashed into the ocean.
The credits will roll while showing still shots from various parts of the
game.
  After the credits are over we get treated with the following message from X:
  "Year 22XX. A reconnaissance mission conducted by a team of Maverick Hunters

 3)The ending from the Mega Man Homepage:

  First you see the space fort blow up, and a space shuttle flies out just in
  time. You don't know who is on the shuttle (Wily or Mega Man), but the next
  thing you see is Mega Man standing in front of a star background.
  The game shows names and images of robot enemies, and when it's done
  Mega Man starts to walk. The background fades in--he's apparently in that
  space shuttle after all.
  He walks to a window where he can see his planet and stops.
The background fades out and is replaced with the closing "Thank you for
Playing,
  Presented by Capcom" phrase.

  explosions, and finally Wily's ship enters Earth and crashes, causing
  smoke to rise from Earth shaped like a skull. Then Mega Man stands in
  space while you look at each enemy you faced.

  After beating Dr.Wily a mechanical arm comes out of his backpack and
  pulls him to safety. MegaMan runs to the right of the ship only to find that
  the exit is blocked. Mega Man tries to shoot it open but it doesn't work.
  Then, a badly damaged Ballade warps in front of the door.
  MegaMan says: "Ballade!! Why are you here?"
  Ballade falls against the door.
  MegaMan: "Stop Ballade!! You're badly injured!"
  Ballade: "I know MegaMan. After our battle, I realized that I was wrong.
  This is all I can do for you now. Good Bye... "
  MegaMan: "Ballade!!!!!"
  Ballade blows up and the door collapses, throwing MegaMan out into space,
  were Rush is waiting for him.
  MegaMan, in a Rush-space ship, watches as Wily's ship blows up.
Then we see pics of MegaMan fighting the different robot masters from the
game,
  followed by a pic of MegaMan watching a sunset and the words
  "Thank you for playing" above.

  After beating Sunstar, he falls against the wall in defeat.
  MegaMan says: "Are you ok? Here, grab my shoulder.
  I'm sure you can be fixed at Dr. Light's lab."
  Sunstar: "MegaMan...why? Why are you helping me?"
  MegaMan: "Because we are both robots."
  Sunstar: "Yes. And we were both created to fight!"
  MegaMan: "No, youâre wrong! I only fight when I am forced to protect the
  world from those who would pit machines against man.
  I believe humans and robots can live in peace!"
  Sunstar: "Maybe...but I will never know. My fusion reactor is going critical
  and when it does, it will destroy this entire fortress."
  MegaMan: "Sunstar..."
  Sunstar: "Leave now!"
  MegaMan runs out, jumps on the Rush Jet and flies away from the space
  fortress just in time to see it explode. MegaMan heads back to earth and
  sets down under the evening sky. As he watches the sky, pics of the
  Robot Masters from the game scroll by.
  After that a laser beam shoots at MegaMan, he jumps and avoids it,
  Dr.Wily appears and Mega Man says: "Wily! You survived?!"
  Wily: "Curse you, Mega Man! This war ends now!"
  Wily's space ship blows up and he falls to the ground. He stands up and
  runs away. Then it shows the Earth with the message:
  "Thank you for playing, presented by CAPCOM"

 3)The ending from myself & Jelly Soup:

  Beat Sigma in the Normal Mode:
  After beating Sigma he says: "Hee hee hee. I guess I'll retreat for now...
  However... X... Don't think that this is the end! Ha ha ha...!"
  We then see X standing beside a collapsed Middy and X says: "Middy, hold on!
  We have to evacuate now!"
  Middy: "Uh... X... It... seems i'm done for... Thanks to you, Techno recovered
  his senses... Thank you, X..." Middy dies and X yells: "Middy!!"
  X teleports back to the Hunter Base and Zero says: "X, our mission here is
  complete. ...What's up, X? Where is Middy?"
  X: "Zero...I'm sorry...I couldn't save Middy's life."
  Zero: "...X. It's not your fault. Middy Sacrificed himself to help all of us.
  He helped us to defeat Sigma...Don't waste his sacrifices!"
  X: ".........It's not true peace when the strong rule the world...
  and the weak is sacrificed... It is very wrong, for sure! I will fight to
  prevent that!"
A message will appear that says: "Thanks to X and Zero's work, Sigma's
ambition
to take over the computer world was stopped. But the last words of Sigma make
X
  feel unrest... 'But, I won't let evil win. No matter how strong or how many
  enemies I must defeat, I will always fight to protect the peace.'
  X makes this promise in his mind."
  After that the credits will roll while showing images of the characters and
  enemies of the game. After the credits are over Middy will come with the
  following message: "Congratulations! You have cleared this game. Let me give
  you a tip as a reward for your efforts. "Hard Mode" is not available! New
  stages and bosses are waiting for you to challenge! You can start a game
  with the same equipment when you've cleared the game. So you'll be prepared
  even when strong enemies attack you! Make sure you remember to save your
  data now!! Good luck!"

  Beat Sigma in the Hard Mode:
  After beating Sigma he will say: "Why... Why do you win all the time...
  Where does your power come from? GuaaaAAA!"
  X teleports back to base and Zero says: "We cleaned out the enemies.
  We can escape from here!" X: "All right! Let's go!"
  The following message appears: "Thanks to X and Zero's work,
  Sigma's ambition to take over the computer world was stopped.
  But evil is very tough to completely stop. When evil emerges again...
  they'll be there to fight... For now, we can only hope that the world will
  give X and Zero some peace..."
  After that the credits will roll while showing images of the characters and
  enemies of the game. After the credits are over Techno offer a challenge with
  the following message: "Humph. You have done very well... I didn't expect that
you would defeat the Hard Mode... But do you have what it takes to complete
the
  "Extreme Mode" which I programmed for you!
This is an awesome mode containing 8 stages to clear. Keep in mind that you
can't
  use the save data that you've cleared. There are no story sequences, as it is
specialized just for battle! So, why don't you save your data here and go for
it?
  If you have the guts... Hope to see you again... Heh heh heh..."

  Beat Sigma in the Extreme Mode:
After beating Sigma the credits will roll while showing images of the
characters
and enemies of the game. After the credits are over Sigma says: "Bwah ha ha
ha.
Your efforts are futile... I will never be defeated!! As long as Mavericks
exist...
  As long as evil exists in the minds of humans... I'll come back again and
  again! X, Zero... I'll pursue you to the end of the world!
  Bwah ha ha ha! Farewell! FOR NOW!! Bwah ha ha!"

  Just beat Berkana with Mega Man in the Normal Mode:
  After beating Berkana it will show X's face and the following message appears:
  "After the battle, X felt the DNA Soul being released. Now the Reploids
  would return to normal. On his way, various memories flash through X's mind.
  The most dominant ones are the memories of Zero. Zero should have finished
  his mission by now. X thinks that he can stand up to any difficulties with his
  partner and friend Zero. While he thinks like that, he can't help but think of
  new challenges to face with his friend."
  The credits will roll while showing images from the game, Iris then comes up
  and says: "Good job! You've cleared the game! If you save the data here, you

  "After the battle, Zero assisted in releasing the DNA Souls.
  Now the Reploids would return to normal. He has no doubt that X has finished
  his mission now. Zero and X have faced and fought through many difficulties
  together. As long as X is with him, Zero can do anything. Though he doesn't
  express it, Zero believes this with all his heart. This is something that will
  never change."
  The credits will roll while showing images from the game, Iris then comes up
  and says: "GREAT JOB! You have cleared two missions. you deserve a Special
  A level Hunter! But still I feel uneasy... I wonder if we really did restore
  peace."

  Just beat Sigma in the Extreme Mode:
  After beating Sigma you will see all the souls escaping the island.
  X says: "Are you all right? Zero?"
  Zero: "Yeah, I am. Hey, look at that!"
  X: "The DNA Soul are returning! The hollow Reploids will come to life!"
  Zero: "Probably...Everything is over, now."
  Iris: "X! Zero! The hollow Reploids are coming to life one by one!"
  Zero: "Iris, rescue the Reploids in cooperation."
  X: "Let's go Zero! We have to express out thanks to Iris."
  Zero: "Right. She was very helpful. I feel sorry that her first
  job as a Maverick Hunter was like this. The Colonel will blame me."
  X: "The colonel? But I believe the experience will be helpful when she
  returns back to the Reploid Force. Anyway, let's go back. We're done here."
  The credits will roll while showing images from the game, Iris then comes up
  and says: "SUPREME JOB! Now that Sigma has been defeated, true peace has
  been restored. So now I have a present for you! This is an awesome mode
  where you fight against 8 bosses. How fast can you beat them? Good luck!"

  After destroying the Life Virus it shows Dr.Wily going mad in his lab
  and he says: "M-M-My LifeVirus!!! What, what, what have you done!?!?
  My WWW!! Nooooo!!!!"
  Computer: "Warning! Warning! Virus leak! All systems malfunctioning!
  Self-destruct sequence activated!"
  Lan: "Uh-oh!"
  Wily: "B-but my precious WWW laboratory!!"
  Lan: "Let's get out of here! MegaMan, Jack out!"
  MegaMan: "Roger!"
  It then shows Lan, Mayl and Chaud in another part of the Lab.
  Mayl: "Lan!"
  Chaud: "Lan! Are you OK?"
  Lan: "Hey guys!"
  Chaud: "And the LifeVirus?"
  Lan: "History!"
  Mayl: "Yippie!"
  Lan: "Where's everyone else?"
  Chaus: "They got away to safety!"
  Lan: "Great! Now, let's scram!!"
  You see all 3 of them escaping the Lab.
  Lan: "Hurry this place is gonna blow!"
  You see Dr.Wily back at his lab and he says: "WWW...Forever!!!"
  Screen fades to black and a message appears: "And so..."
  Now we see everyone in front of Lan's house talking.
  Dad: "Good job, Lan..and, Hub...I mean MegaMan!"
  Mom: "Oh, i'm so glad the two of you are OK!"
  Lan: "Sorry, mom."
  Mom: "Well, I never thought raising two boys was going to be easy!
  Isn't that right, honey?"
  Dad: "Heh...They couldn't have done it without you. Thanks."
  Mom: "They couldn't have done it without us, you mean."
  Dad: "Honey..."
  Mom: "Honey..."
  Mayl: "Her-her, your mom and dad sure get along well, Lan."
  Lan: "I know. It's really embarrassing."

  Mega Man: "Lan, Lan, Lan..."

  with you Lan! After I was so nice...I shouldn't have rescued you after all!"
  Lan: "??? I don't get it! What am I doing wrong??"
  Dex: "*whistle* Yowsas!"
  Yai: "Woo! Woo! Mayl and Lan, up in a tree..."
  Lan: "Mayl and...Huh? Mayl, are you...Do you...?"
  Mayl: "Isn't it obvious!? Really!"
  Lan: "Y-Yeah, but I..."
  Yai: "Don't deny it, Lan..."
  Lan: "Grrr! That's it! This conversation is over!
  Just, thanks for rescuing me, you two!"
  Dex: "Dex always pays his debts! Don't mention it..."
  Lan: "Thanks, Dex, you're a true friend."
  Yai: "That's right...you need a little more practice, though, Dex."
  Dex: "What was that? Me? Practice? Why, you..."
  Chaud: "Well, now...Aren't we the happy bunch now?"
  Lan: "Chaud...Thanks, you really helped me out, too."
  Chaud: "No need to thank me. In fact, you made me look pretty bad...
  Because you did all the work!"
  Lan: "Heh...grumpy as ever, I see... But I couldn't have stopped the WWW
  if you hadn't helped. Thank you!"
  Chaud: "Yeah, well... Thanks accepted, this time. But next time something
  happens, you leave the fighting up to me and Proto Man!"
  Lan: "Hey, we'll be right by your side! Right, MegaMan? Ah, sorry...
  I mean, if you still want, to, um... Hub?"
  Mega Man: "MegaMan's the name, and i'm with you all the way!

  Lan: "Yeah...Right!"
  Mega Man: "Oh, wait! Just one thing... From now on... You're getting up by
  yourself in the morning! Got it?"
  Lan: "What, really...? Awww...."
  Everyone: "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
  Mom: "What? There can't be a crook here now... The alarm system must be
  buggy again! Darn old thing..."
  Mega Man: "Lan! We've got a job to do!"

</pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
  Beat Dr. Wily with Bass.


 3)The ending from myself:

  Beat the game with Megaman:
  After beating Dr.Wily you will see a picture on the left of an unhappy
  Megaman meanwhile Roll, Rush, Beat, Eddie, Auto and Dr.Light run
  towards you as the credits roll on the right of the screen.
  Roll says: "MegaMan, welcome home!" Beat: "Chirp! Chirp!"
  Rush: "Wuff! Wuff!" Auto: "You are so amazing, MegaMan!"
  Dr. Light: "Good work, MegaMan. Huh? What's troubling you? You don't
  look happy."
  MegaMan: "I wish I was a little more efficient...Then I could have
  saved King..."
  Dr. Light: "Don't let it get you down. Why don't you show him that, Roll?"
  Screen changes to Roll holding a letter and she says:
  "Here. It's a letter for you." MegaMan: "A letter? From who?"
  Roll: "Isn't this seal familiar to you...?"
  Screen changes again to Megaman and Roll reading the letter while King
  is being shown in the background.
  "The letter reads: Dear MegaMan, It took our battle for me to realize
  that I was wrong. From now on, I'd like to atone for my crimes against
  the people whom I caused such pain and suffering. I pledge my loyalty to
  world peace until the day that faith of the robots is restored.
  If we were to meet again, I hope it will be as friends and not of enemies.
  Your friend, King."
  MegaMan: "King is alive!?" Roll: "I wish him the best of luck."
  It then says "The end", "Thank you for playing" and it shows the number of
  CDs you found in the game.

  Beat the game with Bass:
  After beating Dr.Wily you will see a picture on the left of Bass itching
  to shoot Dr.Wily while Dr.Wily is covering his face in fear as the credits
  roll on the right of the screen.
  Bass says: "Why did you deceive me!?"
  Dr. Wily: "Eeek! Forgive me! I just wanted to test your ability."
  Bass: "What!? What do you mean?"
  Dr. Wily: "I've always believed that you are the strongest robot in the
  world. But you have not been able to defeat MegaMan... So I began to lose
  my faith in you. Then I had the idea that I could create a mightier robot.
  So, I created King. But since you defeated King, I now know the truth...
  You are the mightiest robot in the world!"
  Bass: "What a lame excuse..."
  Dr. Wily: "Bass, let me show you something... This is the plan for King
the second. Join with King the second and together, you two will be
invincible!"
  Bass: "............"
  The screen goes black and Protoman says: "You never learn, Wily!"
  Dr. Wily: "This voice... ProtoMan!"
  Screen shows Protoman destroying the plans for King II and he says:
  "I won't let this happen!"
  Then the screen changes to an image of Dr.Wily crawling on the floor while
  Bass and Protoman stare at each other and Dr.Wily says: "Oh no...
  My beautiful plan...! Bass, destroy ProtoMan!"
  Bass: "............"
  Dr. Wily: "What are you waiting for, Bass! I said, DESTROY PROTOMAN!"
  ProtoMan: "Bass, you don't need to hesitate, do you? You are not a slave
  to Wily, are you? You are acting on your own, aren't you?
  Not with a partner, no under someone's order..."
  Bass: "I..."
  ProtoMan: "You are strong. That is true. But you can't defeat MegaMan.
  Do you know why? It is because you have nothing to fight for...
  What have you been fighting for, Bass? You don't have anything or anybody
  to fight for, do you? You have fought only for yourself, right?"
  Bass: "Silence! Just get lost!"
  ProtoMan: "Farewell." Protoman leaves after than and it's just Bass and
  Dr.Wily in the room.
  Bass: "What I've fought for? That is ridiculous. I don't need a reason to
  fight. I have and am going to fight only to destroy MegaMan!!"
  It then says "The end", "Thank you for playing" and it shows the number of
  CDs you found in the game.

 3)The ending from Jelly Soup & myself:

  After beating X, we see him half destroyed on the floor and he says:
  "Why... Why... I was... supposed to be... the perfect copy...
  How can this be... possible... I was supposed to be... a hero..."
  Zero: "I've just remembered something... He was not as naive as you are.?
  That's what made him a hero.?
  X: ?I won't forgive you. I'll take you with me............?
  Computer: "THE FINAL DEFENSE LINE HAS BEEN DESTROYED SELF-DESTRUCTION
  MODE ACTIVATED IN AREA X ALL DANGEROUS ELEMENTS ARE TO BE ELIMINATED"
  Zero: "It's time to go..."
  Zero dashes off and we go to a black screen where X says the following:
  "Since you disappeared I've been fighting this war alone against an
  uncountable number of Mavericks for nearly a hundred years...
  Battle after battle...So painful and so sad...But the hardest part was
  when I discovered that I no longer cared about fighting enemies..."
  We see Zero on a desert lying unconscious and X's ghost appears and
  continues saying: "I'll leave this world to you... Please allow me...
  to rest in peace... for a while............. I'm sorry, Zero..."
  X leaves and Zero wakes up and says: "............. So be it...
  But that's why we are the best partners..."
  Zero notices there are hundreds of enemy advancing on him and says:
  "I'll do what you want... Rest for a while. I will handle it,
  you can count on me. I won't stop! When an enemy appears...
  I'll terminate it..." We see a cutscene of Zero slashing an enemy.
  The credits will roll, then you will get your performance results and
  a code to start the game in Hard Mode.

 3)The ending from myself & Jelly Soup:

  After beating Elpizo you will get your performance results and then
  the screen will cut to a half dead Elpizo on the floor saying:
  "Thank you... Zero... Thank you for stopping... you saved me. I almost
  did something... That can't be forgiven... Thank you so much... I was
  so weak-minded... I was so pathetic... Accepting your failures in
  life is a very difficult thing... I think that I've become a little
  stronger from this lesson... Time to say goodbye, Zero. Tell Ciel,
  I'm sorry..."
  Ciel: "Me...? Meeeee!"
  Elpizo: "I feel warm... Ahhh... It appears that she... Saved me.
  She is not evil... Thank you. Zero. And Good bye..."
  Ciel takes Elpizo away in a ball of light.
  Dark Elf: "Zer...Z...Zero........."
  Zero: "!?"
  X appears and says: "She wasn't always called the "Dark Elf"...
  When she was born, she had a mission to save the world, and had another name.
  However, when her ability became a threat of world destruction, they began to
  call her the "Dark Elf"... Since someone called Dr. Weil placed a curse on
  her..."
  Zero says while looking at the sky: "I... I feel that I know her...
  Dark... Elf........."
  The credits will roll and at the end we see some sort of gate and
  Dr. Weil says: "It seems the Dark Elf has been awakened. Hee hee hee hee.
  The time has come for you to take action, Omega...Hee Hee Hee Hee Hee hee."
  You now will get a code to play on Hard Mode.

 2)How to get it:

 3)The ending from myself:

  After defeating the last boss, Zero notices Weil trying messing with
  Omega Zero and says: "You plan to... reactivate Omega?"
  Zero dashes to stop it but gets hit by the black force around Omega.
  Weil says: "Hehehe... Watch, but don't interfere. Don't forget...
  I hold the lives of all humans and Reploids in my hands.
  Harpuia appears and attacks Omega, but the dark force makes him
  pull back. He says: "Zero! What are you doing?! Hurry, stand up!!!"
  Fefnir appears and attacks with fireballs and says: "Hey! I'm here to
  get a little payback, Omega!"
  Leviathan comes as well and attacks Omega but the dark force makes
  her pull back as well. She says: "Time to straighten the record!"
  Zero: "You guys!"
  Harpuia: "Weil is trying to bluff you... He can't do anything in his
  current state."
  Weil: "Argh! Dark Elf! Shut them up!"
  Dark Elf: "Zeeeerroooo!"
  Omega-Zero: "What is it, Dark Elf?!"
  X Cyber Elf appears and says: " Her... The Dark Elf's curse is fading..."
  Weil: "Who's that! X?!"
  X: "That's right, Weil. Just like a century ago... I worked with Zero to
  defeat this Omega then... And we saved the world from your greedy clutches."
  Zero: "Just like...a century ago?"
  X: "The defeated Omega is using your original body. That's all...
  Your current body may be a copy... But your heart is the real thing.
  All right, now's the time. While the Dark Elf's power is weak. Time to
  finish what you started a century ago, Zero!"
  Weil: "Zero, don't do it!!! That's your original body!
  Don't you feel any attachment?! Are you really prepared to spend the
  rest of your life in that cheap fake?!"
  X: "You can do it. You know what's truly important. Go on, Zero!"
  Zero goes ahead and destroys Omega for good.
  Screen goes white.
  Ciel: "Ze...ro... Zero... Wake up... Zero..."
  Zero appears to be unconscious, and X appears in front of him.
  X: "Can you hear me, Zero? My energy is almost all spent. I can't...
  stay in this world... much longer. Zero... I want to leave this world
  in your care. The threat Weil represents has not left this world.
  I want you...to protect humans and Reploids. Ze...ro... You can do it...
  You...can..."
  Scene changes to the roof of the Resistance Base, where Ciel, Cerveau
  and two Resistance soldiers stand near Zero.
  Ciel: "Zero, wake up!"
  Zero gets up.
  Ciel: "Zero! Ah, what a relief! I was so worried about you..."
  Soldier 1: "Mr. Zero! You've regained consciousness! What a relief...
  Hey! Everyone! Mr. Zero is awake! He's all right! Yahooo!!!"
  Zero: "Where is this... the Resistance Base? Who could have...?"
  Mother Elf: "Zerrroooo..."
  We see teh Mother Elf and Zero says: "Dark Elf? Wait, no. You are..."
  Cerveau: "She brought you back here."
  Mother Elf: "Ze...ro..."
  Ciel: "What a warm, gentle light..."
  Zero: "Mother Elf... Has Weil's curse been broken?"
  Mother Elf flies off.
  Zero: "Shouldn't we follow her?"
  Ciel: "She's finally free. There's still Weil, but let's let her go in
  peace for now. X told me about you, Zero."
  Zero: "Really..."
  Ciel: "I know you're not worried about a thing, but..."
  Zero: "?"
  Ciel: "Even if your body is a copy... As long as your heart is your own,
  you are Zero. The one and only, Zero..."
  Zero: "Ciel... Thank you."
  Ciel: "Ze-Zero!"
  Zero: "It's just me... I am... ... Zero."
  The credits will roll and you will get a code to play in Hard Mode.

 Mega Man: The Wily Wars                              [ Europe - Mega Drive ]
           --------------------------------------------------------

 1)Number of endings:

  4


 2)How to get them:

  -Mega Man-
  Just beat Dr.Wily.

  -Mega Man 2-
  Just beat Dr.Wily's Alien.

  -Mega Man 3-
  Just beat Dr.Wily.

  -Wily Tower-
  Just beat Dr.Wily.


 3)The ending from myself:

  -Mega Man-
  Dr.Wily falls out of his machine and starts bowing. The scene changes and a
  message appears: "Mega Man has ended the evil domination of Dr.Wily and
  restored the world to peace. However, the never ending battle continues until
  all destructive forces are defeated. Fight, Mega Man! For everlasting peace!"
  Mega Man starts running home through some scenery. The sun goes down, you only
  see his shadow, and when the moon comes up he is human. He goes through a
  city up to a house. Dr. Light and Roll are there, and Mega Man leaps into the
  air. Then the words "Presented by Capcom" appear.

  -Mega Man 2-
  The ending begins when the starry background of the final battle disappears at
  the defeat of the alien, revealing an ordinary room in Dr. Wily's fortress.
  The scientist himself is behind some controls, and a holographic projector is
  moving in the exact formation as the alien had. The alien wasn't real;
  Dr. Wily was using an illusion. The projector falls to the floor, disabled,
  and Wily jumps down and starts begging. Then the scene shifts. The screen
  shows Mega Man walking on a black background, and in the corner is a small
  picture of a valley and a small village.
  As Mega Man walks, the seasons change, as reflected not only in the small
  picture but also by precipitation that covers the screen and also represents
  one of Mega Man's current weapons. For instance, for fall you see leaves from
  the Leaf Shield slowly drifting downward. For winter, white Metal Blades that
  look like snow flakes. Spring: pink Quick Boomerangs that look like petals of
  flowers falling from blooming tress.
  And summer is rain--arm cannon shots that drop fast and steadily.
  Then Mega Man stops. He looks up suddenly at the image in the corner of the
  screen.
  Then the image widens to include the entire screen, but Mega Man is no longer
  standing there. Only his helmet remains. The credits roll after that.

  -Mega Man 3-
  When you beat the final Dr. Wily, blocks start falling from the ceiling.
  Then a block falls on Dr. Wily, then another one falls on Mega Man.
  Then a shadowy Proto Man falls on the block that is on Mega Man and breaks
  it. He says: "Where's Wily?... Oh no. Too late" After that, Mega Man wakes up
  with Dr. Light in front of him. Light says: "Mega Man, you've regained
  consciousness. I found you lying here when I arrived. I wonder who brought you
  here!" Then the Proto Man music starts. Light says: "That whistle... it must
  have been Proto Man!" Then Mega Man starts walking on the grass, and at the
  same time we see the faces of the Mega Man 1 bosses, Roll, Mega Man and
  Proto Man. Then Mega Man looks at the sky, where there is a picture of
  Proto Man. The credits will roll and the Mega Man 3 bosses will be displayed.

  -Wily Tower-
  After beating Dr.Wily, he falls from his machine and starts to bow for mercy,
  then a bomb falls in the middle of the screen and Dr.Wily starts to escape.
  We see Wily's Tower being destroyed and then we see Mega Man running after
  Dr.Wily in some sort of meadow while the bosses from the first 3 Mega Man
  games are shown on top of the screen. Wily trips and falls and his ship
  comes and rescues him with a beam of light, Wily escapes again and the game
  will say: "Thank you for playing, presented by CAPCOM"

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Dr.Wily.


 3)The ending from Jelly Soup & myself:

  After defeating Dr.Wily's ship, he falls and gets on his hands and knees.
  Dr. Wily says to Mega Man: "S.......sorry! I was wrong! Please forgive me!"
  MegaMan: "...thatâs the same old apology, Wily! Over and over again..."
  Then both of them look up in shock as a sphere of dark energy appears
  for just a moment.
  Dr. Wily: "W... what!"
  The evil energy surrounds Mega Man.
  Mega Man: "Uwaaaah!"
  MegaMan yells in pain as an energy field sucks him and disappears while
  Wily looks on in, shocked.
  We then switch to the out side where MegaMan is laying, close to death,
  in a smoking crater. Duo walks up to find him and examines his body.
  Duo says: "This is not good. he has been affected by the evil energy.
  He will die soon."
  Duo raises his hand and yells at the top of his lungs.
  Duo: "Ahhhhhhhhhhh!" focusing all his energy to one point and touches it
  to MegaMans chest.
  Duo: "If your mind has not completely taken by the evil, then you will
  be safe."
  MegaMan's face contracts into an expression of pain.
  Duo: "MegaMan, I can see into your mind."
  We then see images of all the hell MegaMan has gone through in the name of
  peace. As Duo takes his hand off of MegaMans chest,Mega Man's face looks
  relieved. Duo stands up, holding the evil energy in his hand.
  Duo: "You have been working so hard for justice. With your help, this
  planet will survive."
  Mega Man smiles. At this point, Protoman runs up.
  ProtoMan: "What happened? MegaMan!"
  Duo: "Heâs going to be okay, he will regain consciousness soon.
  My job is done, I must go. I'll leave MegaMan up to you."
  He turns to walk off, but stops.
  Duo: "But, thereâs one more thing...."
  Protoman: "Huh?"
  Duo: "I have.....a favor to ask."
  We then switch to a scene at Dr.Light's lab.
  Roll: "Wake up, wake up MegaMan!"
  MegaMan: "Roll!"
  Roll: "Oh, MegaMan, you're ok!!!!"
  Eddie and Turbo rejoice in the back ground.
  MegaMan: "Am I alive?"
  Dr.Light: "Yes, you are. Duo saved you."
  MegaMan: (slightly confused) "Ahhh....Duo..."
  MegaMan and Rush stand outside on a cliff with a sunset on the horizon.
  Protoman: "Duo is gone."
  MegaMan: "Protoman!"
  Protoman: "MegaMan... I have a message to give you, from Duo."
  MegaMan: "From Duo?? What is it?"
  Protoman: "He said....thank you."
  MegaMan: "Duo... *closes his teary eyes for a moment* Me too!
  Thank you... Duo."
  The sun sets, a picture of Duo appears in the night sky.
  We are then treated to the credits along with pics and concept sketches
  of the robot masters from the game AND concept art of robot masters that
  never were. We then get a really freaken cool image of MegaMan, Rush and
  Beat with the words 'Thank you for playing, Presented by CAPCOM' on screen.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Mega Man:
  After beating Dr.Wily, he falls to the ground. Mega Man flies off on top of
  Rush With the base blowing up in the backgound.
  The screen switches to Dr.Light's lab where Roll says: "Welcome back MegaMan.
  Glad to see you made it."
  Megaman: "Yeah. But Dr.Wily got away again."
  Dr.Light: "Glad to see you made it back in one piece."
  MegaMan: "Even so, if things don't change, the battle against Dr.Wily will
  never end."
  Dr.Light: "Its just what you say, but this time we learned what robots need."
  Auto: "Yeah, a hero like me, right?"
  Dr.Light: "Well... not quite."
  MegaMan: "What exactly do robots need?"
  Dr.Light: "Like humans, the robot has to determine what is right and what
  is wrong by itself. Robots are not supposed to hurt humans.
  We need to research more on A.I. program."
  MegaMan: "When will there be world peace?"
  Dr.Light: "That will be up to us."
  MegaMan:" Ok, i'll fight for everyoneâs future."

  Protoman, Dr.Light's first ever built robot just before completion,
  he ran away and vanished. He appears before MegaMan from time to time
  and mysteriously disappears. Is he friend or foe? Where is he off to?
  Nobody knows."

  playing, Presented by CAPCOM" on the screen.

  The base blows up and Bass appears on a near by cliff carrying Dr.Wily and
  he says: "Nooo...! My laboratory! Bass, what are you doing?!"
  Bass: "Now you know that I am the strongest. There's no need for you
  to make any more junk robots."
  Wily: "The strongest? You've been beaten by Mega Man before."
  Bass: "I underestimated him that time. But I will conquer him this time."
  Wily: "Yeah right. You can battle with Mega Man all you want. The robot
  I'm making right now will blow both of you away."
  Bass: "Ha! All you make is junk. Do what you want." Bass leaves.
  Wily: "Wait. Wait Bass. Don't leave me here!"
  The credits will roll and at the very end we get treated with a shot of

  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Wily says: "You always interfere with me."
  Mega Man: "I'll keep on fighting for Peace for both humans and robots!"
  Dr.Wily: "Peace for humans and robots? Then why do you destroy my robots you
  metallic hypocrite? Do you destroy them to bring them peace?
  What's the difference between my actions and yours?
  We are so alike, you and I!"
  Mega Man: "Nooo! Can I really be the same as Wily? It's true I destroy his
  robots with no hesitation! I could have negotiated with the robots instead
  of slaying them. Maybe I could have made peace... am I as violent and evil
  as the man I oppose? Am I spreading war instead of stopping it?"
  Rolls enters the scene.
  Roll: "It's not true Mega Man! Don't listen to Wily, heâs just playing
  mind games with you!"
  Auto: "Thatâs right. You're doing the right thing Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war
  are destroyed."
  Mega Man: "T....thank you everyone.... Thank you everyone! I will not yield!"
  Dr.Wily: "Ha! What a cheap show. Thanks for being an idiot.
  I think i'll leave now."
  Dr.Wily escapes.
  MegaMan: "Hey! Wait, Wily!"
  After that the credits roll.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Proto Man:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, you both escape and land on a cliff while Dr.Wily's
  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Light: "Listen Protoman how do you feel? How is your body holding up?"
  Protoman: "........"
  Dr.Light: "You don't have to say anything. I know how you suffer, Protoman.
  Your energy system has acquired a terrible defect. Unless it is fixed,
  your body will... and only I can fix your body as I am your creator..."
  Protoman: "Don't worry about my problems. I know my own body better than
  anyone else. And remember, I'm unbeatable! No matter what."
  Dr.Light: "Don't talk that way Protoman, the war is over. Let's live together
  and keep the peace."
  Protoman: "Thatâs not my style. I'll do it myself. I don't need anybody!
  Nice chatting with you Doc, but I got things to do. Later."
  Dr.Light: "Protoman! Protoman! Wait, you need to be repaired!"
  A shot of Protoman leaving is shown and the following text appears on screen:

  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Light: "Thank you Duo. You've saved us!"
  Duo: "I was once saved by you and Mega Man. I've always wanted to thank
  you for that. Now my debt to you is paid. Dr.Light, have you noticed
  that this energy is a lot like mine?"
  It shows Duo's hand holding the energy.
  Dr.Light: "You're right!"
  Duo: "I've found an "Alien Energy" on Earth! This energy is too dangerous
  to remain on Earth. I'll bring it home."
  It shows Dr.Light shaking Duo's Hand.
  Dr.Light: "Thanks."
  Duo: "I must leave now."
  Dr.Light: "Oh... so your going home? Duo, do you think we'll ever meet
  again?"
  Duo: "Someday..."
  Dr.Light:" Yes... promise me that we will meet again."
  Duo: "Thatâs a promise. Good-bye!"
  A shot of Duo is shown with the following text on the bottom of the screen:
  "The mysterious new character "Duo". He does not seem to be an enemy,
  but who is he? What happened between him and MegaMan in the past?
  And what did Dr.Light mean by "Alien Energy"? Play MegaMan 8 to find out!"
  After that the credits roll.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Bass:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, you both escape and land on a cliff while Dr.Wily's
  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Wily says: "Why do you oppose me, the one that created you?"
  Bass: "Because you always interfere with me! I can defeat MegaMan by my
  self with no problem. You should go crawl in a hole somewhere."
  Dr.Wily: "You know, I think I regret creating you, pompous robot."
  Bass: "Ha! You created me? So what? If you created a powerful robot
  such as myself, it must have been an accident."
  It shows an image of Dr.Wily creating Bass and Dr.Wily says:
  "Funny you should say that, you're actually right. I studied Mega Man
  hoping to create a similar robot. Then I developed a powerful energy called
  "Bassnium" purely by accident. Thus, I created you Bass.
  Currently, Bassnium is the most powerful energy on Earth.
  But, thatâs not for long. Hee hee. I've learned from my accident...
and i've created a new type of robot which is more powerful than you or
MegaMan!
It'll be some time before I complete this project, though. You better get
ready!
  A screenshot of the silouette of Zero appears on the screen.
  Bass: "Ha! This girlie-looking, long-haired robot will be the strongest?
  Don't make me laugh!"
Dr.Wily: "Don't be so overconfident. This robots power level is far superior
to
yours. And this is more that just a simple robot. With this and my other
project
complete, the world will be mine! No one will be able to stop me! Hee hee hee
hee!"
The following text appears on the screen: "Yikes! This guy is as crazy as I
thought.
What on Earth is the new robot Wily is currently developing? What are it's
powers?"
  After that the credits roll.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Mega Man & Proto Man:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, all 3 of you escape and land on a cliff while
  Dr.Wily's castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Wily says: "You always interfere with me."
  Mega Man: "I'll keep on fighting for Peace for both humans and robots!"
  Dr.Wily: "Peace for humans and robots? Then why do you destroy my robots you
  metallic hypocrite? Do you destroy them to bring them peace?
  What's the difference between my actions and yours?
  We are so alike, you and I!"

  Roll: "It's not true Mega Man! Don't listen to Wily, heâs just playing

  Auto: "Thatâs right. You're doing the right thing Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war
  are destroyed."
  Protoman: "You have a good soul but sometimes you're too naive.
  Believe in your self MegaMan! Your way is not wrong.
  It is the righteous path."
  Mega Man: "T....thank you everyone.... Thank you everyone! I will not yield!"
  Dr.Wily: "Ha! What a cheap show. Thanks for being an idiot.
  I think i'll leave now."
  Dr.Wily escapes.

  After that the credits roll.

  Dr.Light: "Thank you Duo. You've saved us!"
  Duo: "I was once saved by you and Mega Man. I've always wanted to thank
  you for that. Now my debt to you is paid. Dr.Light, have you noticed
  that this energy is a lot like mine?"
  It shows Duo's hand holding the energy.
  Dr.Light: "You're right!"
  Duo: "I've found an "Alien Energy" on Earth! This energy is too dangerous
  to remain on Earth. I'll bring it home."
  It shows Mega Man shaking Duo's Hand.
  MegaMan: "So, you're going Duo?"
  Duo: "Yes. The Earth will be safe as long as your here to protect it.
  I'm bringing home both your justice energy and the "Alien Energy"."
  MegaMan: "We will meet again, right? Promise it to me Duo!"
  A shot of Duo is shown with the following text on the bottom of the screen:
  "The mysterious new character "Duo". He does not seem to be an enemy,
  but who is he? What happened between him and MegaMan in the past?
  And what did Dr.Light mean by "Alien Energy"? Play MegaMan 8 to find out!"
  After that the credits roll.

  of your business."
  Bass: "Your mysterious behavior annoys me! I'll deal wtih you
  after I defeat Mega Man."
  Protoman: "Thatâs fine by me, but you can't defeat Mega Man."
  Bass: "What are you saying!"
  Protoman: "You and Mega Man have completely different goals."
  Bass: "What!"
  Protoman: "You only care about petty things like fighting to be the best.
  But MegaMan is different. He cares about the future."
  Shows an image of Mega Man on the screen.

  By the way Proto Man, what is the relationship between you and Mega Man?
  I feel that there is a strong bond between you two..."
  Protoman: "There's no relation. I like to be alone."

 3)The ending from myself:

  When you beat the final Dr. Wily, blocks start falling from the ceiling.
  Then a block falls on Dr. Wily, then another one falls on Mega Man.
  Then the shadow of Proto Man falls on the block that is on Mega Man and breaks
  it. He says: "Where's Wily?... Oh no. Too late" After that, Mega Man wakes up
  with Dr. Light in front of him. Light says: "Mega Man, you've regained
  consciousness. I found you lying here when I arrived. I wonder who brought you
  here!" Then the Proto Man music starts. Light says: "That whistle... it must
  have been Proto Man!" Then Mega Man starts walking on the grass, and at the
  same time we see the faces of the Mega Man 1 bosses, Roll, Mega Man and
  Proto Man. Then Mega Man looks at the sky, where there is a picture of
  Proto Man. The credits will roll and the Mega Man 3 bosses will be displayed.

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Dr.Wily.


 3)The ending from Jelly Soup & myself:

  After defeating Dr.Wily's ship, he falls and gets on his hands and knees.
  Dr. Wily says to Mega Man: "S.......sorry! I was wrong! Please forgive me!"
  MegaMan: "...thatâs the same old apology, Wily! Over and over again..."
  Then both of them look up in shock as a sphere of dark energy appears
  for just a moment.
  Dr. Wily: "W... what!"
  The evil energy surrounds Mega Man.
  Mega Man: "Uwaaaah!"
  MegaMan yells in pain as an energy field sucks him and disappears while
  Wily looks on in, shocked.
  We then switch to the out side where MegaMan is laying, close to death,
  in a smoking crater. Duo walks up to find him and examines his body.
  Duo says: "This is not good. he has been affected by the evil energy.
  He will die soon."
  Duo raises his hand and yells at the top of his lungs.
  Duo: "Ahhhhhhhhhhh!" focusing all his energy to one point and touches it
  to MegaMans chest.
  Duo: "If your mind has not completely taken by the evil, then you will
  be safe."
  MegaMan's face contracts into an expression of pain.
  Duo: "MegaMan, I can see into your mind."
  We then see images of all the hell MegaMan has gone through in the name of
  peace. As Duo takes his hand off of MegaMans chest,Mega Man's face looks
  relieved. Duo stands up, holding the evil energy in his hand.
  Duo: "You have been working so hard for justice. With your help, this
  planet will survive."
  Mega Man smiles. At this point, Protoman runs up.
  ProtoMan: "What happened? MegaMan!"
  Duo: "Heâs going to be okay, he will regain consciousness soon.
  My job is done, I must go. I'll leave MegaMan up to you."
  He turns to walk off, but stops.
  Duo: "But, thereâs one more thing...."
  Protoman: "Huh?"
  Duo: "I have.....a favor to ask."
  We then switch to a scene at Dr.Light's lab.
  Roll: "Wake up, wake up MegaMan!"
  MegaMan: "Roll!"
  Roll: "Oh, MegaMan, you're ok!!!!"
  Eddie and Turbo rejoice in the back ground.
  MegaMan: "Am I alive?"
  Dr.Light: "Yes, you are. Duo saved you."
  MegaMan: (slightly confused) "Ahhh....Duo..."
  MegaMan and Rush stand outside on a cliff with a sunset on the horizon.
  Protoman: "Duo is gone."
  MegaMan: "Protoman!"
  Protoman: "MegaMan... I have a message to give you, from Duo."
  MegaMan: "From Duo?? What is it?"
  Protoman: "He said....thank you."
  MegaMan: "Duo... *closes his teary eyes for a moment* Me too!
  Thank you... Duo."
  The sun sets, a picture of Duo appears in the night sky.
  We are then treated to the credits along with pics and concept sketches
  of the robot masters from the game AND concept art of robot masters that
  never were. We then get a really freaken cool image of MegaMan, Rush and
  Beat with the words 'Thank you for playing, Presented by CAPCOM' on screen.

 3)The ending from Jelly Soup, World of Nintendo & The Megaman Homepage:

  -Mega Man-
  Dr.Wily falls out of his machine and starts bowing. The scene changes and a
  message appears: "Mega Man has ended the evil domination of Dr.Wily and
  restored the world to peace. However, the never ending battle continues until
  all destructive forces are defeated. Fight, Mega Man! For everlasting peace!"
  Mega Man starts running home through some scenery. The sun goes down, you only
  see his shadow, and when the moon comes up he is human. He goes through a
  city up to a house. Dr. Light and Roll are there, and Mega Man leaps into the
  air. Then the words "Presented by Capcom" appear.

  -Mega Man 2-
  The ending begins when the starry background of the final battle disappears at
  the defeat of the alien, revealing an ordinary room in Dr. Wily's fortress.
  The scientist himself is behind some controls, and a holographic projector is
  moving in the exact formation as the alien had. The alien wasn't real;
  Dr. Wily was using an illusion. The projector falls to the floor, disabled,
  and Wily jumps down and starts begging. Then the scene shifts. The screen
  shows Mega Man walking on a black background, and in the corner is a small
  picture of a valley and a small village.
  As Mega Man walks, the seasons change, as reflected not only in the small
  picture but also by precipitation that covers the screen and also represents
  one of Mega Man's current weapons. For instance, for fall you see leaves from
  the Leaf Shield slowly drifting downward. For winter, white Metal Blades that
  look like snow flakes. Spring: pink Quick Boomerangs that look like petals of
  flowers falling from blooming tress.
  And summer is rain--arm cannon shots that drop fast and steadily.
  Then Mega Man stops. He looks up suddenly at the image in the corner of the
  screen.
  Then the image widens to include the entire screen, but Mega Man is no longer
  standing there. Only his helmet remains. The credits roll after that.

  -Mega Man 3-
  When you beat the final Dr. Wily, blocks start falling from the ceiling.
  Then a block falls on Dr. Wily, then another one falls on Mega Man.
  Then the shadow of Proto Man falls on the block that is on Mega Man and breaks
  it. He says: "Where's Wily?... Oh no. Too late" After that, Mega Man wakes up
  with Dr. Light in front of him. Light says: "Mega Man, you've regained
  consciousness. I found you lying here when I arrived. I wonder who brought you
  here!" Then the Proto Man music starts. Light says: "That whistle... it must
  have been Proto Man!" Then Mega Man starts walking on the grass, and at the
  same time we see the faces of the Mega Man 1 bosses, Roll, Mega Man and
  Proto Man. Then Mega Man looks at the sky, where there is a picture of
  Proto Man. The credits will roll and the Mega Man 3 bosses will be displayed.

  -Mega Man 4-
  After you defeat Dr. Wily, he falls down before Mega Man, presumably begging
  Mega Man to not hurt him any more. Then he stands up, escapes through a secret
  rotating door and all of Skull Castle goes on Red Alert. Then you see Skull
  Castle from a distance, flashing, and Dr. Wily's escape ship flying away.
  The castle starts to explode, and you see Mega Man beam out from it. It
  explodes in a skull-shaped mushroom cloud. Mega Man rides home on the roof of
  a train while some of the closing credits show up underneath.
He arrives home to meet Rush and Roll. Then the screen goes dark before
showing
  all of the eight boss robots and their designers.
  Finally, "special thanks" credits scroll up, ending finally with Flip Top
  spitting the letters "CAPCOM" out his head.

  -Mega Man 5-
  After Wily's defeat, the entire ceiling falls down, almost crushing Mega Man,
  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily in one smooth blow. But Mega Man catches the entire
  thing and holds it up. Dr. Wily grabs his chance and escapes. Mega Man can't
  move, and Dr. Light is stuck behind him.
  A whistle comes. Proto Man doesn't actually appear, but you can tell he's done
  something because part of the ceiling blows away, giving Mega Man and his
  creator just enough time and space to get out of there. The next scene shows
  them standing outside, watching as the castle crumbles to nothingness.
  Curiously enough, you can see Proto Man's helmet in the corner of the screen,
  he's standing with them. But right before the screen fades, he simply drops
  off the corner of the screen... The credits will roll after that.

  -Mega Man 6-
  Dr Wily falls out of his machine and starts bowing. The scene changes and
  Mega Man is holding Dr. Wily with a rope, then a newspaper shows him in jail
  with the following text: "Triunphant at last, Mega Man arrested the notorious
  Dr.Wily and brought him to justice. Sentenced to prison for his crimes,
  Dr.Wily now rules over a prison cell. At long last, the world is at peace."
  After that, they show each robot alone in its room doing its moves and then
  they are shown in space with their designers name.
  The credits roll and it says: "To be continued..." on the screen.

  -Mega Man 7-
  After Wily's last ship explodes, he falls to his hands and knees and says,
  "Alright Mega Man, you win. Sorry for all the trouble. I'll go quietly."
  At this point, Mega Man charges up his mega buster and says, "I don't trust
  you Wily! I gonna do what I should have done years ago!"
  Wily backs up saying, "You forget, Mega Man! Robots can't harm humans!"
  Mega Man quits charging and says, "I am more than a robot! Die, Wily!"
  At this point, an alarm goes off and part of the ceiling falls, pinning Wily
  to the floor. A small piece then bonks Wily on the head. Treble comes down,
  barks, and teleports Wily out. At this point, Bass appears and says, "Too
  late, Mega Man! He who hesitates is lost! We shall return!" Then he also
  leaves and the alarm sounds again.
  The credits will roll, during the credits we see each boss robot Mega Man
  faced in the game, along with its designer and number.
  The last 2 to be displayed are Bass and Treble. At the end of the credits, the
  view goes to the sky where a shooting star can be seen, then back down to
  Big Eddy's. Mega Man goes inside and a photo is taken. Beat flies, Rush yawns,
  and Auto(with his hyperbolt in) puts up his fan for the photo, which has a red
  dot like the Japanese flag. The final screen has the Presented by Capcom
  business, with a No. line at the bottom displaying the 1 on 1 fighting code

  -Mega Man 8-
  After defeating Dr.Wily's ship, he falls and gets on his hands and knees.
  Dr. Wily says to Mega Man: "S.......sorry! I was wrong! Please forgive me!"
  MegaMan: "...thatâs the same old apology, Wily! Over and over again..."
  Then both of them look up in shock as a sphere of dark energy appears
  for just a moment.
  Dr. Wily: "W... what!"
  The evil energy surrounds Mega Man.
  Mega Man: "Uwaaaah!"
  MegaMan yells in pain as an energy field sucks him and disappears while
  Wily looks on in, shocked.
  We then switch to the out side where MegaMan is laying, close to death,
  in a smoking crater. Duo walks up to find him and examines his body.
  Duo says: "This is not good. he has been affected by the evil energy.
  He will die soon."
  Duo raises his hand and yells at the top of his lungs.
  Duo: "Ahhhhhhhhhhh!" focusing all his energy to one point and touches it
  to MegaMans chest.
  Duo: "If your mind has not completely taken by the evil, then you will
  be safe."
  MegaMan's face contracts into an expression of pain.
  Duo: "MegaMan, I can see into your mind."
  We then see images of all the hell MegaMan has gone through in the name of
  peace. As Duo takes his hand off of MegaMans chest,Mega Man's face looks
  relieved. Duo stands up, holding the evil energy in his hand.
  Duo: "You have been working so hard for justice. With your help, this
  planet will survive."
  Mega Man smiles. At this point, Protoman runs up.
  ProtoMan: "What happened? MegaMan!"
  Duo: "Heâs going to be okay, he will regain consciousness soon.
  My job is done, I must go. I'll leave MegaMan up to you."
  He turns to walk off, but stops.
  Duo: "But, thereâs one more thing...."
  Protoman: "Huh?"
  Duo: "I have.....a favor to ask."
  We then switch to a scene at Dr.Light's lab.
  Roll: "Wake up, wake up MegaMan!"
  MegaMan: "Roll!"
  Roll: "Oh, MegaMan, you're ok!!!!"
  Eddie and Turbo rejoice in the back ground.
  MegaMan: "Am I alive?"
  Dr.Light: "Yes, you are. Duo saved you."
  MegaMan: (slightly confused) "Ahhh....Duo..."
  MegaMan and Rush stand outside on a cliff with a sunset on the horizon.
  Protoman: "Duo is gone."
  MegaMan: "Protoman!"
  Protoman: "MegaMan... I have a message to give you, from Duo."
  MegaMan: "From Duo?? What is it?"
  Protoman: "He said....thank you."
  MegaMan: "Duo... *closes his teary eyes for a moment* Me too!
  Thank you... Duo."
  The sun sets, a picture of Duo appears in the night sky.
  We are then treated to the credits along with pics and concept sketches
  of the robot masters from the game AND concept art of robot masters that
  never were. We then get a really freaken cool image of MegaMan, Rush and
  Beat with the words 'Thank you for playing, Presented by CAPCOM' on screen.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Mega Man:
  After beating Dr.Wily, he falls to the ground. Mega Man flies off on top of
  Rush With the base blowing up in the backgound.
  The screen switches to Dr.Light's lab where Roll says: "Welcome back MegaMan.
  Glad to see you made it."
  Megaman: "Yeah. But Dr.Wily got away again."
  Dr.Light: "Glad to see you made it back in one piece."
  MegaMan: "Even so, if things don't change, the battle against Dr.Wily will
  never end."
  Dr.Light: "Its just what you say, but this time we learned what robots need."
  Auto: "Yeah, a hero like me, right?"
  Dr.Light: "Well... not quite."
  MegaMan: "What exactly do robots need?"
  Dr.Light: "Like humans, the robot has to determine what is right and what
  is wrong by itself. Robots are not supposed to hurt humans.
  We need to research more on A.I. program."
  MegaMan: "When will there be world peace?"
  Dr.Light: "That will be up to us."
  MegaMan:" Ok, i'll fight for everyoneâs future."

  he ran away and vanished. He appears before MegaMan from time to time
  and mysteriously disappears. Is he friend or foe? Where is he off to?

  to make any more junk robots."
  Wily: "The strongest? You've been beaten by Mega Man before."
  Bass: "I underestimated him that time. But I will conquer him this time."
  Wily: "Yeah right. You can battle with Mega Man all you want. The robot
  I'm making right now will blow both of you away."

  Mega Man: "I'll keep on fighting for Peace for both humans and robots!"
  Dr.Wily: "Peace for humans and robots? Then why do you destroy my robots you
  metallic hypocrite? Do you destroy them to bring them peace?
  What's the difference between my actions and yours?
  We are so alike, you and I!"
  Mega Man: "Nooo! Can I really be the same as Wily? It's true I destroy his
  robots with no hesitation! I could have negotiated with the robots instead
  of slaying them. Maybe I could have made peace... am I as violent and evil
  as the man I oppose? Am I spreading war instead of stopping it?"
  Rolls enters the scene.
  Roll: "It's not true Mega Man! Don't listen to Wily, heâs just playing
  mind games with you!"
  Auto: "Thatâs right. You're doing the right thing Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war

  your body will... and only I can fix your body as I am your creator..."
  Protoman: "Don't worry about my problems. I know my own body better than

  self with no problem. You should go crawl in a hole somewhere."
  Dr.Wily: "You know, I think I regret creating you, pompous robot."
  Bass: "Ha! You created me? So what? If you created a powerful robot
  such as myself, it must have been an accident."
  It shows an image of Dr.Wily creating Bass and Dr.Wily says:
  "Funny you should say that, you're actually right. I studied Mega Man
  hoping to create a similar robot. Then I developed a powerful energy called
  "Bassnium" purely by accident. Thus, I created you Bass.
  Currently, Bassnium is the most powerful energy on Earth.
  But, thatâs not for long. Hee hee. I've learned from my accident...
and i've created a new type of robot which is more powerful than you or
MegaMan!
It'll be some time before I complete this project, though. You better get
ready!
  A screenshot of the silouette of Zero appears on the screen.
  Bass: "Ha! This girlie-looking, long-haired robot will be the strongest?
  Don't make me laugh!"
Dr.Wily: "Don't be so overconfident. This robots power level is far superior
to
yours. And this is more that just a simple robot. With this and my other
project
complete, the world will be mine! No one will be able to stop me! Hee hee hee
hee!"

 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Great Redips.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After beating Great Redips he will say in disbelief: "Impossible!
  Absolutely impossible!
  My... infinite power! This can't be! How could I lose?"
  We next see Redips in his normal form lying on the floor, he says:
  "Are you happy now, X?"
  X: "Redips... what made you Maverick?"
  Redips: "Maverick? You seem more Maverick to me. With all your stubborn
  nonsense about friendship and your unwillingness to evolve.
  Zero: "You don't know a thing about friendship Maverick scum."
  Redips: "Stay in our place, be friendly to all. Decade after decade...
  indefinetly. Is this all reploids will ever be? One day... you'll see...
  we'll...change the world..."
  Now we see a FMV where Mega Man, Zero, Axl run into Ferham who is still
  holding the Supra-Force Metal she stole from Redips. They are all in outside
  in space on a huge piece of the Far East HQ that came lose because of Redips'
  actions before the last battle.
  Ferham with her back turned says: "Don't worry, I'll get rid of this with my
  own hands, ok X?"
  X: "Yeah, ok."
  Ferham smiles and Zero says after noticing the ship trembling: "Huh? X, Hurry,
  we're gonna reach the atmosphere any second now."
  Ferham turns and says: "X? Sorry for all that happened."
  X: "It's ok Ferham, just hurry and get rid of it. Huh??"
  Before X notices, Ferham jumps from the ship into space and says:
  "I'll take it to a place so far away that nobody will find it."
  X runs to grab her and says: "Ferham!" But to no avail.
  X screams and we see the ship getting slowly destroyed by the Earth's
  atmosphere.
  Axl says: "We must close the hatch!"
  All 3 of them go in and X stares into space while the hatch is closing.
  Then it shows Ferham floating in space and she says: "This is how it should
  be... I'll join the Commander and Scarface soon. Farewell..."
  She then self destructs along with the Supra Force Metal.
  We now see Nana in some sort of wasteland, she looks up in the sky and sees
  Ferham's explosion.
  It now goes to a shot of X blowing the hatch open with his X-Buster, Zero,
  Axl and X come out the ship, which appears to have crashed into the ocean.
The credits will roll while showing still shots from various parts of the
game.
  After the credits are over we get treated with the following message from X:
  "Year 22XX. A reconnaissance mission conducted by a team of Maverick Hunters
  successfully quelled a Reploid uprising in the man made island of Giga City.
  The federation government determined the mastermind behind the rebellion
  was the Maverick Redips. Determination of the Maverick status of the commander
  of the rebellion army, Epsilon, was differed."
  After that you get to save your game and get the Central Key item.

  After beating Dr.Wily, he falls to the ground. Mega Man flies off on top of
  Rush With the base blowing up in the backgound.
  The screen switches to Dr.Light's lab where Roll says: "Welcome back MegaMan.
  Glad to see you made it."
  Megaman: "Yeah. But Dr.Wily got away again."
  Dr.Light: "Glad to see you made it back in one piece."
  MegaMan: "Even so, if things don't change, the battle against Dr.Wily will
  never end."
  Dr.Light: "Its just what you say, but this time we learned what robots need."
  Auto: "Yeah, a hero like me, right?"
  Dr.Light: "Well... not quite."
  MegaMan: "What exactly do robots need?"
  Dr.Light: "Like humans, the robot has to determine what is right and what
  is wrong by itself. Robots are not supposed to hurt humans.
  We need to research more on A.I. program."
  MegaMan: "When will there be world peace?"
  Dr.Light: "That will be up to us."
  MegaMan:" Ok, i'll fight for everyoneâs future."
  The credits will roll and at the very end we get treated with a shot of

  playing, Presented by CAPCOM" on the screen.

  Protoman, Dr.Light's first ever built robot just before completion,
  he ran away and vanished. He appears before MegaMan from time to time
  and mysteriously disappears. Is he friend or foe? Where is he off to?
  Nobody knows."

  The base blows up and Bass appears on a near by cliff carrying Dr.Wily and
  he says: "Nooo...! My laboratory! Bass, what are you doing?!"
  Bass: "Now you know that I am the strongest. There's no need for you
  to make any more junk robots."
  Wily: "The strongest? You've been beaten by Mega Man before."
  Bass: "I underestimated him that time. But I will conquer him this time."
  Wily: "Yeah right. You can battle with Mega Man all you want. The robot
  I'm making right now will blow both of you away."
  Bass: "Ha! All you make is junk. Do what you want." Bass leaves.
  Wily: "Wait. Wait Bass. Don't leave me here!"

  Beat Dr.Wily with Mega Man:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, you both escape and land on a cliff while Dr.Wily's
  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Wily says: "You always interfere with me."
  Mega Man: "I'll keep on fighting for Peace for both humans and robots!"
  Dr.Wily: "Peace for humans and robots? Then why do you destroy my robots you
  metallic hypocrite? Do you destroy them to bring them peace?
  What's the difference between my actions and yours?
  We are so alike, you and I!"
  Mega Man: "Nooo! Can I really be the same as Wily? It's true I destroy his
  robots with no hesitation! I could have negotiated with the robots instead
  of slaying them. Maybe I could have made peace... am I as violent and evil
  as the man I oppose? Am I spreading war instead of stopping it?"
  Rolls enters the scene.
  Roll: "It's not true Mega Man! Don't listen to Wily, heâs just playing
  mind games with you!"
  Auto: "Thatâs right. You're doing the right thing Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war
  are destroyed."
  Mega Man: "T....thank you everyone.... Thank you everyone! I will not yield!"
  Dr.Wily: "Ha! What a cheap show. Thanks for being an idiot.
  I think i'll leave now."
  Dr.Wily escapes.
  MegaMan: "Hey! Wait, Wily!"
  After that the credits roll.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Proto Man:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, you both escape and land on a cliff while Dr.Wily's
  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Light: "Listen Protoman how do you feel? How is your body holding up?"
  Protoman: "........"
  Dr.Light: "You don't have to say anything. I know how you suffer, Protoman.
  Your energy system has acquired a terrible defect. Unless it is fixed,
  your body will... and only I can fix your body as I am your creator..."
  Protoman: "Don't worry about my problems. I know my own body better than
  anyone else. And remember, I'm unbeatable! No matter what."
  Dr.Light: "Don't talk that way Protoman, the war is over. Let's live together
  and keep the peace."
  Protoman: "Thatâs not my style. I'll do it myself. I don't need anybody!
  Nice chatting with you Doc, but I got things to do. Later."
  Dr.Light: "Protoman! Protoman! Wait, you need to be repaired!"
  A shot of Protoman leaving is shown and the following text appears on screen:
  "Protoman has a defect in his energy system. It must be fixed soon.
  What will happen to Protoman's body? And where is Protoman going?"
  After that the credits roll.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Duo:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, you both escape and land on a cliff while Dr.Wily's
  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Light: "Thank you Duo. You've saved us!"
  Duo: "I was once saved by you and Mega Man. I've always wanted to thank
  you for that. Now my debt to you is paid. Dr.Light, have you noticed
  that this energy is a lot like mine?"
  It shows Duo's hand holding the energy.
  Dr.Light: "You're right!"

  to remain on Earth. I'll bring it home."
  It shows Dr.Light shaking Duo's Hand.
  Dr.Light: "Thanks."
  Duo: "I must leave now."
  Dr.Light: "Oh... so your going home? Duo, do you think we'll ever meet
  again?"
  Duo: "Someday..."
  Dr.Light:" Yes... promise me that we will meet again."
  Duo: "Thatâs a promise. Good-bye!"
  A shot of Duo is shown with the following text on the bottom of the screen:
  "The mysterious new character "Duo". He does not seem to be an enemy,
  but who is he? What happened between him and MegaMan in the past?
  And what did Dr.Light mean by "Alien Energy"? Play MegaMan 8 to find out!"
  After that the credits roll.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Bass:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, you both escape and land on a cliff while Dr.Wily's
  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Wily says: "Why do you oppose me, the one that created you?"
  Bass: "Because you always interfere with me! I can defeat MegaMan by my
  self with no problem. You should go crawl in a hole somewhere."
  Dr.Wily: "You know, I think I regret creating you, pompous robot."
  Bass: "Ha! You created me? So what? If you created a powerful robot
  such as myself, it must have been an accident."
  It shows an image of Dr.Wily creating Bass and Dr.Wily says:
  "Funny you should say that, you're actually right. I studied Mega Man
  hoping to create a similar robot. Then I developed a powerful energy called
  "Bassnium" purely by accident. Thus, I created you Bass.
  Currently, Bassnium is the most powerful energy on Earth.
  But, thatâs not for long. Hee hee. I've learned from my accident...
and i've created a new type of robot which is more powerful than you or
MegaMan!
It'll be some time before I complete this project, though. You better get
ready!
  A screenshot of the silouette of Zero appears on the screen.
  Bass: "Ha! This girlie-looking, long-haired robot will be the strongest?
  Don't make me laugh!"
Dr.Wily: "Don't be so overconfident. This robots power level is far superior
to
yours. And this is more that just a simple robot. With this and my other
project
complete, the world will be mine! No one will be able to stop me! Hee hee hee
hee!"
The following text appears on the screen: "Yikes! This guy is as crazy as I
thought.

powers?"

  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war

  Protoman: "You have a good soul but sometimes you're too naive.
  Believe in your self MegaMan! Your way is not wrong.
  It is the righteous path."

  after I defeat Mega Man."
  Protoman: "Thatâs fine by me, but you can't defeat Mega Man."
  Bass: "What are you saying!"
  Protoman: "You and Mega Man have completely different goals."

  But MegaMan is different. He cares about the future."
  Shows an image of Mega Man on the screen.

  We will both have serious problems if we fight right now!"
  Bass: "Don't worry. I'll be ok. Only you will be destroyed!"

 3)The ending from Jelly Soup, World of Nintendo & The Megaman Homepage:

  -Mega Man-
  Dr.Wily falls out of his machine and starts bowing. The scene changes and a
  message appears: "Mega Man has ended the evil domination of Dr.Wily and
  restored the world to peace. However, the never ending battle continues until
  all destructive forces are defeated. Fight, Mega Man! For everlasting peace!"
  Mega Man starts running home through some scenery. The sun goes down, you only
  see his shadow, and when the moon comes up he is human. He goes through a
  city up to a house. Dr. Light and Roll are there, and Mega Man leaps into the
  air. Then the words "Presented by Capcom" appear.

  -Mega Man 2-
  The ending begins when the starry background of the final battle disappears at
  the defeat of the alien, revealing an ordinary room in Dr. Wily's fortress.
  The scientist himself is behind some controls, and a holographic projector is
  moving in the exact formation as the alien had. The alien wasn't real;
  Dr. Wily was using an illusion. The projector falls to the floor, disabled,
  and Wily jumps down and starts begging. Then the scene shifts. The screen
  shows Mega Man walking on a black background, and in the corner is a small
  picture of a valley and a small village.
  As Mega Man walks, the seasons change, as reflected not only in the small
  picture but also by precipitation that covers the screen and also represents
  one of Mega Man's current weapons. For instance, for fall you see leaves from
  the Leaf Shield slowly drifting downward. For winter, white Metal Blades that
  look like snow flakes. Spring: pink Quick Boomerangs that look like petals of
  flowers falling from blooming tress.
  And summer is rain--arm cannon shots that drop fast and steadily.
  Then Mega Man stops. He looks up suddenly at the image in the corner of the
  screen.
  Then the image widens to include the entire screen, but Mega Man is no longer
  standing there. Only his helmet remains. The credits roll after that.

  -Mega Man 3-
  When you beat the final Dr. Wily, blocks start falling from the ceiling.
  Then a block falls on Dr. Wily, then another one falls on Mega Man.
  Then the shadow of Proto Man falls on the block that is on Mega Man and breaks
  it. He says: "Where's Wily?... Oh no. Too late" After that, Mega Man wakes up
  with Dr. Light in front of him. Light says: "Mega Man, you've regained
  consciousness. I found you lying here when I arrived. I wonder who brought you
  here!" Then the Proto Man music starts. Light says: "That whistle... it must
  have been Proto Man!" Then Mega Man starts walking on the grass, and at the
  same time we see the faces of the Mega Man 1 bosses, Roll, Mega Man and
  Proto Man. Then Mega Man looks at the sky, where there is a picture of
  Proto Man. The credits will roll and the Mega Man 3 bosses will be displayed.

  -Mega Man 4-
  After you defeat Dr. Wily, he falls down before Mega Man, presumably begging
  Mega Man to not hurt him any more. Then he stands up, escapes through a secret
  rotating door and all of Skull Castle goes on Red Alert. Then you see Skull
  Castle from a distance, flashing, and Dr. Wily's escape ship flying away.
  The castle starts to explode, and you see Mega Man beam out from it. It
  explodes in a skull-shaped mushroom cloud. Mega Man rides home on the roof of
  a train while some of the closing credits show up underneath.
He arrives home to meet Rush and Roll. Then the screen goes dark before
showing
  all of the eight boss robots and their designers.
  Finally, "special thanks" credits scroll up, ending finally with Flip Top
  spitting the letters "CAPCOM" out his head.

  -Mega Man 5-
  After Wily's defeat, the entire ceiling falls down, almost crushing Mega Man,
  Dr. Light and Dr. Wily in one smooth blow. But Mega Man catches the entire
  thing and holds it up. Dr. Wily grabs his chance and escapes. Mega Man can't
  move, and Dr. Light is stuck behind him.
  A whistle comes. Proto Man doesn't actually appear, but you can tell he's done
  something because part of the ceiling blows away, giving Mega Man and his
  creator just enough time and space to get out of there. The next scene shows
  them standing outside, watching as the castle crumbles to nothingness.
  Curiously enough, you can see Proto Man's helmet in the corner of the screen,
  he's standing with them. But right before the screen fades, he simply drops
  off the corner of the screen... The credits will roll after that.

  -Mega Man 6-
  Dr Wily falls out of his machine and starts bowing. The scene changes and
  Mega Man is holding Dr. Wily with a rope, then a newspaper shows him in jail
  with the following text: "Triunphant at last, Mega Man arrested the notorious
  Dr.Wily and brought him to justice. Sentenced to prison for his crimes,
  Dr.Wily now rules over a prison cell. At long last, the world is at peace."
  After that, they show each robot alone in its room doing its moves and then
  they are shown in space with their designers name.
  The credits roll and it says: "To be continued..." on the screen.

  -Mega Man 7-
  After Wily's last ship explodes, he falls to his hands and knees and says,
  "Alright Mega Man, you win. Sorry for all the trouble. I'll go quietly."
  At this point, Mega Man charges up his mega buster and says, "I don't trust
  you Wily! I gonna do what I should have done years ago!"
  Wily backs up saying, "You forget, Mega Man! Robots can't harm humans!"
  Mega Man quits charging and says, "I am more than a robot! Die, Wily!"
  At this point, an alarm goes off and part of the ceiling falls, pinning Wily
  to the floor. A small piece then bonks Wily on the head. Treble comes down,
  barks, and teleports Wily out. At this point, Bass appears and says, "Too
  late, Mega Man! He who hesitates is lost! We shall return!" Then he also
  leaves and the alarm sounds again.
  The credits will roll, during the credits we see each boss robot Mega Man
  faced in the game, along with its designer and number.
  The last 2 to be displayed are Bass and Treble. At the end of the credits, the
  view goes to the sky where a shooting star can be seen, then back down to
  Big Eddy's. Mega Man goes inside and a photo is taken. Beat flies, Rush yawns,
  and Auto(with his hyperbolt in) puts up his fan for the photo, which has a red
  dot like the Japanese flag. The final screen has the Presented by Capcom
  business, with a No. line at the bottom displaying the 1 on 1 fighting code

  -Mega Man 8-
  After defeating Dr.Wily's ship, he falls and gets on his hands and knees.
  Dr. Wily says to Mega Man: "S.......sorry! I was wrong! Please forgive me!"
  MegaMan: "...thatâs the same old apology, Wily! Over and over again..."
  Then both of them look up in shock as a sphere of dark energy appears
  for just a moment.
  Dr. Wily: "W... what!"
  The evil energy surrounds Mega Man.
  Mega Man: "Uwaaaah!"
  MegaMan yells in pain as an energy field sucks him and disappears while
  Wily looks on in, shocked.
  We then switch to the out side where MegaMan is laying, close to death,
  in a smoking crater. Duo walks up to find him and examines his body.
  Duo says: "This is not good. he has been affected by the evil energy.
  He will die soon."
  Duo raises his hand and yells at the top of his lungs.
  Duo: "Ahhhhhhhhhhh!" focusing all his energy to one point and touches it
  to MegaMans chest.
  Duo: "If your mind has not completely taken by the evil, then you will
  be safe."
  MegaMan's face contracts into an expression of pain.
  Duo: "MegaMan, I can see into your mind."
  We then see images of all the hell MegaMan has gone through in the name of
  peace. As Duo takes his hand off of MegaMans chest,Mega Man's face looks
  relieved. Duo stands up, holding the evil energy in his hand.
  Duo: "You have been working so hard for justice. With your help, this
  planet will survive."
  Mega Man smiles. At this point, Protoman runs up.
  ProtoMan: "What happened? MegaMan!"
  Duo: "Heâs going to be okay, he will regain consciousness soon.
  My job is done, I must go. I'll leave MegaMan up to you."
  He turns to walk off, but stops.
  Duo: "But, thereâs one more thing...."
  Protoman: "Huh?"
  Duo: "I have.....a favor to ask."
  We then switch to a scene at Dr.Light's lab.
  Roll: "Wake up, wake up MegaMan!"
  MegaMan: "Roll!"
  Roll: "Oh, MegaMan, you're ok!!!!"
  Eddie and Turbo rejoice in the back ground.
  MegaMan: "Am I alive?"
  Dr.Light: "Yes, you are. Duo saved you."
  MegaMan: (slightly confused) "Ahhh....Duo..."
  MegaMan and Rush stand outside on a cliff with a sunset on the horizon.
  Protoman: "Duo is gone."
  MegaMan: "Protoman!"
  Protoman: "MegaMan... I have a message to give you, from Duo."
  MegaMan: "From Duo?? What is it?"
  Protoman: "He said....thank you."
  MegaMan: "Duo... *closes his teary eyes for a moment* Me too!
  Thank you... Duo."
  The sun sets, a picture of Duo appears in the night sky.
  We are then treated to the credits along with pics and concept sketches
  of the robot masters from the game AND concept art of robot masters that
  never were. We then get a really freaken cool image of MegaMan, Rush and
  Beat with the words 'Thank you for playing, Presented by CAPCOM' on screen.

  -Mega Man: The Power Battle-
  Beat Dr.Wily with Mega Man:
  After beating Dr.Wily, he falls to the ground. Mega Man flies off on top of
  Rush With the base blowing up in the backgound.
  The screen switches to Dr.Light's lab where Roll says: "Welcome back MegaMan.
  Glad to see you made it."
  Megaman: "Yeah. But Dr.Wily got away again."
  Dr.Light: "Glad to see you made it back in one piece."
  MegaMan: "Even so, if things don't change, the battle against Dr.Wily will
  never end."
  Dr.Light: "Its just what you say, but this time we learned what robots need."
  Auto: "Yeah, a hero like me, right?"
  Dr.Light: "Well... not quite."
  MegaMan: "What exactly do robots need?"
  Dr.Light: "Like humans, the robot has to determine what is right and what
  is wrong by itself. Robots are not supposed to hurt humans.
  We need to research more on A.I. program."
  MegaMan: "When will there be world peace?"
  Dr.Light: "That will be up to us."
  MegaMan:" Ok, i'll fight for everyoneâs future."
  The credits will roll and at the very end we get treated with a shot of

  playing, Presented by CAPCOM" on the screen.

  Beat Dr.Wily with Proto Man:
  After beating Dr.Wily, he falls to the ground. Proto Man escapes and
  watches as Wily's base blows up. Then you see him standing on top
  of a building at night.
  The following text appears: "Protoman... who is he?
  Protoman, Dr.Light's first ever built robot just before completion,
  he ran away and vanished. He appears before MegaMan from time to time
  and mysteriously disappears. Is he friend or foe? Where is he off to?
  Nobody knows."

  Bass: "Now you know that I am the strongest. There's no need for you
  to make any more junk robots."
  Wily: "The strongest? You've been beaten by Mega Man before."
  Bass: "I underestimated him that time. But I will conquer him this time."
  Wily: "Yeah right. You can battle with Mega Man all you want. The robot
  I'm making right now will blow both of you away."
  Bass: "Ha! All you make is junk. Do what you want." Bass leaves.
  Wily: "Wait. Wait Bass. Don't leave me here!"

  castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Wily says: "You always interfere with me."
  Mega Man: "I'll keep on fighting for Peace for both humans and robots!"
  Dr.Wily: "Peace for humans and robots? Then why do you destroy my robots you
  metallic hypocrite? Do you destroy them to bring them peace?
  What's the difference between my actions and yours?
  We are so alike, you and I!"
  Mega Man: "Nooo! Can I really be the same as Wily? It's true I destroy his
  robots with no hesitation! I could have negotiated with the robots instead
  of slaying them. Maybe I could have made peace... am I as violent and evil
  as the man I oppose? Am I spreading war instead of stopping it?"
  Rolls enters the scene.
  Roll: "It's not true Mega Man! Don't listen to Wily, heâs just playing
  mind games with you!"
  Auto: "Thatâs right. You're doing the right thing Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war
  are destroyed."
  Mega Man: "T....thank you everyone.... Thank you everyone! I will not yield!"
  Dr.Wily: "Ha! What a cheap show. Thanks for being an idiot.

  Dr.Light: "You don't have to say anything. I know how you suffer, Protoman.
  Your energy system has acquired a terrible defect. Unless it is fixed,
  your body will... and only I can fix your body as I am your creator..."
  Protoman: "Don't worry about my problems. I know my own body better than
  anyone else. And remember, I'm unbeatable! No matter what."
  Dr.Light: "Don't talk that way Protoman, the war is over. Let's live together
  and keep the peace."

  Nice chatting with you Doc, but I got things to do. Later."
  Dr.Light: "Protoman! Protoman! Wait, you need to be repaired!"
  A shot of Protoman leaving is shown and the following text appears on screen:

  that this energy is a lot like mine?"
  It shows Duo's hand holding the energy.

  After that the credits roll.

  After defeating Dr.Wily, you both escape and land on a cliff while Dr.Wily's
  castle blows up in the background.

  Bass: "Because you always interfere with me! I can defeat MegaMan by my
  self with no problem. You should go crawl in a hole somewhere."
  Dr.Wily: "You know, I think I regret creating you, pompous robot."
  Bass: "Ha! You created me? So what? If you created a powerful robot
  such as myself, it must have been an accident."
  It shows an image of Dr.Wily creating Bass and Dr.Wily says:
  "Funny you should say that, you're actually right. I studied Mega Man
  hoping to create a similar robot. Then I developed a powerful energy called
  "Bassnium" purely by accident. Thus, I created you Bass.
  Currently, Bassnium is the most powerful energy on Earth.
  But, thatâs not for long. Hee hee. I've learned from my accident...
and i've created a new type of robot which is more powerful than you or
MegaMan!
It'll be some time before I complete this project, though. You better get
ready!
  A screenshot of the silouette of Zero appears on the screen.
  Bass: "Ha! This girlie-looking, long-haired robot will be the strongest?
  Don't make me laugh!"
Dr.Wily: "Don't be so overconfident. This robots power level is far superior
to
yours. And this is more that just a simple robot. With this and my other
project
complete, the world will be mine! No one will be able to stop me! Hee hee hee
hee!"
The following text appears on the screen: "Yikes! This guy is as crazy as I
thought.
What on Earth is the new robot Wily is currently developing? What are it's
powers?"
  After that the credits roll.

  metallic hypocrite? Do you destroy them to bring them peace?

  Auto: "Thatâs right. You're doing the right thing Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Sometimes peace cannot be achieved unless those who spread war

  Believe in your self MegaMan! Your way is not wrong.
  It is the righteous path."

  after I defeat Mega Man."
  Protoman: "Thatâs fine by me, but you can't defeat Mega Man."
  Bass: "What are you saying!"
  Protoman: "You and Mega Man have completely different goals."
  Bass: "What!"
  Protoman: "You only care about petty things like fighting to be the best.
  But MegaMan is different. He cares about the future."
  Shows an image of Mega Man on the screen.

  After defeating Dr.Wily, all 3 of you escape and land on a cliff while
  Dr.Wily's castle blows up in the background.
  Bass: "The time has finally come! Fight me Mega Man!"
  Mega Man: "What are you talking about? Under these conditions Bass?
  We are both heavily damaged from the previous fights.
  We will both have serious problems if we fight right now!"
  Bass: "Don't worry. I'll be ok. Only you will be destroyed!"
  Mega Man: "You don't get it Bass! I don't want to fight you!"
  Bass: "You don't have a choice. This is our fate! You can't escape!
  So come and get it!"
  Mega Man: "If this is what you truly want I will... I will fight you!"

  Beat Dr.Wily with Bass & Duo:
  After defeating Dr.Wily, all 3 of you escape and land on a cliff while
  Dr.Wily's castle blows up in the background.
  Dr.Light: "Thank you Duo. You've saved us!"
  Duo: "I was once saved by you and Mega Man. I've always wanted to thank
  you for that. Now my debt to you is paid. Dr.Light, have you noticed
  that this energy is a lot like mine?"
  It shows Duo's hand holding the energy.
  Dr.Light: "You're right!"
  Duo: "I've found an "Alien Energy" on Earth! This energy is too dangerous
  to remain on Earth. I'll bring it home."
  It shows Duo with his arm extended trying to shake hands but Bass just stays
  with his arms crossed.
  Duo: "See you Bass."
  Bass: "Don't talk, just leave."
  Duo: "I can feel your justice energy Bass. Don't deny it."
  Bass: "I don't care about justice or peace! Who's the strongest?
  Thatâs my only concern."
  Duo: "You're so strange Bass. But thatâs ok. I still like you."
  Bass:" Hey, I accept your challenge. When will you come back to Earth?
  You'd better train hard before you return."
  Duo: "I understand. See you Bass."
  A shot of Duo is shown with the following text on the bottom of the screen:
  "The mysterious new character "Duo". He does not seem to be an enemy,
  but who is he? What happened between him and MegaMan in the past?
  And what did Dr.Light mean by "Alien Energy"? Play MegaMan 8 to find out!"
  After that the credits roll.

  Beat Onslaught with Mega Man:
  After defeating Onslaught we see Mega Man in Onslaught's burning city,
  A small atom-like glowing orb sits in the center of the ground.
  Mega Man grabs it and acquires it's power.
  Screen changes and it shows Mega Man stands on the left, facing right and
  demonstrates his new weapon, which a caption below describes:
  "You now have Electromagnetic Shockwave"
  The credits roll after that while showing the characters from the game
  running around doing various things.

  Beat Onslaught with Roll:
  After defeating Onslaught we see Roll in Onslaught's burning city,
  Rush sits waiting on the right projecting Dr.Light for Roll.
  Roll says: "I did it!  I finished the stage before Mega Man!"
  Dr.Light: "Wow... that's amazing, roll! Dr Wiley's evil ambition must
  be stopped. I'm gonna enhance your power! Now get going!"
  Fliptop beams down and drops a little atom-like orb, Roll catches grabs it
  and transforms into Hyper Roll.
  Roll: "Yes! I'm ready to save the world! Let's do it!"
  Dr.Light: "Good luck Roll! Do your best!"
  Roll leaves off to the right as Rush and Fliptop beam out.
  Mega Man then runs in and looks around, finding nothing.
  He drops on his knees and sheds a tear.
  The credits roll after that while showing the characters from the game
  running around doing various things.
