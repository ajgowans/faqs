1. GAME INFO

Rather than porting Rockman & Forte (for the Super Famicom) to the Wonderswan,
Capcom gave Bandai the OK to make an all-new game. Rockman & Forte are still
here, along with music from the SFC game, but the levels and bosses are
exclusive to this game (Quint being the exception; see "Characters" below).


2. CHARACTERS

ROCKMAN - Our hero, known as Mega Man in the US. Originally designed as a lab
assistant, he became a combat robot when Dr. Wily went renegade.

ROLL - Rockman's "sister," created to be a housekeeping robot.

RIGHTOT - Also known as Auto. He's a robot that runs an item shop back at Dr.
Light's lab.

BLUES - Rockman's "brother." Blues was the first robot that Dr. Light built. In
the US, he's called Proto Man ("prototype").

DR. LIGHT - The creator of Rockman, Roll, and Rightot.

DR. WILY - A former colleague of Dr. Light, who went mad and tried to take over
the world numerous times. He was defeated each time by Rockman.

FORTE - Rockman's archnemesis, built by Dr. Wily. Forte is fiercely
competitive, and refuses to believe that any robot could be more powerful than
himself.

R-SHADOW - Or as we know him, Quint. He's a future version of Rockman, stolen
and reprogrammed for evil by Dr. Wily. He was defeated the first time he tried
to destroy Rockman (see Mega Man II on Game Boy for details), but now he's
back, and he's brought along a slew of new robots he's built.


3. CONTROLS

Some levels use the Wonderswan's vertical control mode (you turn the Wonderswan
90 degrees to the left). The control is obviously a little different in that
mode.

Horizontal mode:

Lower (X) D-pad: Movement
B: Fire (with Rockman, hold to charge)
A: Jump (with Forte, press twice to double-jump)
Down (X3) + A: Slide/Dash
Start: Pause/Weapon Select

Vertical mode:

Upper/left (Y) D-pad: Movement
X1 (or X4): Fire (with Rockman, hold to charge)
X2 (or X3): Jump (with Forte, press twice to double-jump)
Down (Y4) + X2 (or X3): Slide/Dash
Start: Pause/Weapon Select


4. SUGGESTED ORDER

NOTE: Bosses marked with an asterisk (*) have levels that use the vertical
control mode.

Konro Man - Aircon Man* - Dangan Man - Komuso Man - Clock Men - Compass Man


5. WEAKNESSES

Well...it goes like this. None of these bosses are "weak" against a particular
weapon. They all essentially do the same amount of damage. However, some
weapons will hit a particular foe repeatedly, doing more damage in the long
run. That's the weapon you'd want to use.

6. ATTACK PATTERNS

NOTE: These strategies assume you're using Rockman. If you're using Forte,
adjust your strategy accordingly.

Aircon Man - This guy's an Air Man wannabe who carries hand fans. Hand fans?
What, is the giant fan in his chest not enough?! Sheesh. Anyways, you can
destroy his initial spread shot. When he floats to the top center of the
screen, stand beneath him and use the Flame Shower. Once those clouds start
coming in from either side of the screen, however, get the hell out! If you get
crushed between them, you're dead. After the clouds, Aircon Man will draw 3
flying enemies towards him, and you'll usually be in the way. Just keep up your
attacks, and you'll be rid of him.

Clock Men - Not one, but two annoyances. You'll have to destroy both, of
course. Luckily, the Barrier Wind/Forte Cyclone will dispatch them in no time.
They'll attack from both sides and use a time-freezing ability, but you should
be able to destroy them fairly quickly before they get a chance to do much
damage.

Compass Man - What a pain in the ass. Not only does this guy split in half to
attack you, but you can only attack the top part of his lower half! And to
really piss you off, he won't give you a weapon once you off him. So make him
suffer! While his lower half is running around, dodge it and blast the hell out
of the small orb on top of it. When Compass Man reforms, just avoid him as much
as you can until he splits again. The jerk won't even give you a weapon for all
your trouble.

Dangan Man - The Barrier Wind can knock off a HUGE chunk of this guy's life!
Wait until he's standing one side of the screen (he'll jump back and forth, and
fire at you), then blast away. Be ready to jump, too; true to his name, he'll
turn into a bullet and launch himself across the screen a few times.

Gray Devil - You fight this thing at the end of the intro stage. He'll fire out
3 blobs that'll sting you, as well as stick you to the ground (fire repeatedly
to break free). Then he'll melt into a blob and move towards you. He's not too
tough; you'll notice that the blobs always land in the same spot, so just stand
where they DON'T land, and blast away. Jump over him when he gets close, and
keep going until he's destroyed.

Komuso Man - He can be rather difficult. He'll split himself into triplets,
then all three of them will fire a spread shot at you from the ceiling. Then
he'll land a reform himself. When he's whole, hold down your Fire button while
using the Flame Shower to fry him. Halfway through the battle, Komuso Man will
summon moving flames from the floor. Jump over them, and continue using your
Flame Shower like a flamethrower. He's tough, but you'll beat him with
practice.

Konro Man - This pest will fire a bunch of flames into the air. When they float
back down, you can destroy them. He'll then fire a trio of flames at you, which
will leave some flames behind, and then bounce back towards him. Your best bet
is to attack him right after the flames return to him. When he moves to the top
of the screen, stay as far off the side as you can; he'll fire a spread shot,
which you can easily jump over.

R-Shadow (Quint) - Quint will first jump over you and shoot at you or
slide-attack you. Just dodge him and shoot him with your Buster. Halfway
through the battle, he'll teleport over your head and try to drill into you.
Quint will also cause large rocks to come crashing down. His head is his weak
point here. Towards the end, he'll break out a beam saber. Dodge like mad, and
use the Barrier Wind/Forte Cyclone to obliterate him for good.


7. WEAPON DESCRIPTIONS

Rockman:

Rock Buster - Rockman's standard arm cannon. You can fire up to three shots at
once, or charge it up for a more powerful shot.

Barrier Wind - A wave of compressed air.

Doppel Crash - A dashing attack, similar to the Break Dash from MMV on Game
Boy.

Flame Shower - You can hold the button down for a short-range flamethrower, or
release it to send flames straight up.

Rockn Vulcan - A triple spread-shot cannon, that can home in on some targets.

Time Switch - Just like the Time Stopper from MM2, this weapon wil temporarily
freeze time.


Forte:

Forte Buster - Forte's standard arm cannon. You can rapid-fire it by holding
the button down, as well as fire in all directions by pressing the D-pad in the
direction you wish to fire (straight up, etc.). Forte cannot run while firing,
but he can jump.

Doppeler Attack - Forte breaks into four pieces to damage enemies. Hold the
fire button down to phase through walls.

Flame Mixer - Rotating fireballs that surround you.

Forte Cyclone - Same as Barrier Wind (above).

Forte Vulcan - Energy pulse that homes in on targets.

Time Bomb - Same as Time Switch (above).


8. ITEMS

You can buy all manner of crap from Rightot's shop by collecting bolts. Some
items only Rockman can use, and some only Forte can use, but most of them can
be used by either character. Cost is listed in parentheses () next to each
item. Items marked with an asterisk (*) can only be used ONCE. Items are also
marked [R] if only Rockman can use them, or [F] if only Forte can use them. The
items are listed as they appear on the screen, from left to right.


First row:

Rockman 1-Up [R] (200) - Extra life.

Forte 1-Up [F] (200) - Extra life.

Exit Unit* (50) - Teleport out of a stage you've already completed.

Rush Coil* [R] (100) - Bounce off Rush's back like a springboard.

Gospel Boost* [F] (200) - Gospel teleports down and becomes a jetpack for a
short time.

Tango* [R] (200) - Just like in MMV, Tango will bounce around the screen
breaking things.


Second row:

Power Shot [F] (300) - Increases the power of your Forte Buster.

save you. Remember that it only works ONCE!

Armor (300) - You'll take less damage.


9. NOTES

- Yes, I know they spell it "CompasMan" in the game. I threw in the extra "S"
for clarity's sake.
- Wondering where the hell some of these boss names come from? My guess is that
the development team smoked a lot of pot. At any rate, "compass" and "clock"
are fairly obvious. Even "aircon" isn't too much of a stretch (it's short for
"air conditioner"). As for the more obscure names:
- A "konro" is a type of cooking grill. That explains the flames that Konro Man
shoots out, as well as the dial on his face (the thermostat).
- A "komuso" is a style of bamboo flute. The outfit that Komuso Man wears is
modeled after a traditional costume for a komuso player.
- A "dangan" is a bullet.
- There's no E-Tanks in this game. Yeah, it sucks, but at least you can save
after each stage.
- This is only the second original series Rockman game where Dr. Wily is NOT
the final boss. (The other is MMV on Game Boy.)


10. CREDITS

- Thanks go out to Capcom and Bandai for producing such an obscure game that
still manages to be a decent platformer.
- Thanks to my pal "Hiro-kun" for some translation assistance.
