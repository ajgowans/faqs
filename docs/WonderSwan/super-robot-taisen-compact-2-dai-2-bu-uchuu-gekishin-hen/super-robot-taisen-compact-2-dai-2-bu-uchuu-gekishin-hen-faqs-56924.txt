   This is a guide for "Super Robot Taisen Compact 2 Dai 2 Bu", the second of
three parts of this Wonderswan game. I hope this can be helpful for all those
who want to play this game.

   Before going any further, please notice this document aims to describe all
stages, events and possibities available on the game; therefore, it's full of
spoilers. I did this because most of this guide's intended readers can't read
japanese and would not be able to make sense of the game's story by any other
means.

GAMEPLAY DETAILS-------------------------------------------------------------


   Since this is really not different from any other Super Robot Taisen game,
most of you probably are already familiar with the mechanics of it. So, this
is here pretty much for filler - not very helpful those who have never played
anything like this...


1 - Pilot Status
----------------

   Each pilot has a given set of skills and characteristics, which determines
his/her effectiveness in battle. A pilot's status is unique (no two different
pilots have exactly the same skills), and should be considered when assigning
robots to each pilot.


 Kakutou (Fighting)  The pilot skill when using fighting attacks. The higher
                     it is, the more damaging his/her fighting attacks are.

 Shageki (Shooting)  The pilot skill when using shooting attacks. The higher
                     it is, the more damaging his/her shooting attacks are.

 Kaihi   (Evade)     Shows the pilot's dodging skill. Higher values indicate
                     your pilot has better chances to escape enemy attacks.

 Meichuu (Aiming)    The pilot's aiming skill - the higher it is, the easier
                     it is for a pilot to hit an enemy.

 Han'nou (Response)  A measure of the pilot's reflexes. Higher values affect
                     both the pilot's hit and evade rates positively.

 Giryou  (Skill)     The pilot's competency. Higher values make it easier to
                     make critical hits and avoid receiving them.


   Both Aiming and Evade are presented in a "XXX + XX" format. Only the first
number applies to the pilot; the second is the robot's agility, which changes
according to the robot the pilot is boarding.



2 - Unit Status
---------------

   Like pilots, robots and ships have certain skills and characteristics that
differentiate them from each other.


 HP    (Hit Points)  The unit's "life meter". The higher the value, the more
                     damage the unit can suffer before being destroyed.

 EN      (Energy)    The unit's "fuel meter". You spend 1 EN for each square
                     moved in the sky. Some attacks also consume energy when
                     used. Each unit recovers 5 EN every turn.

 Terrain Grades      The unit's efficiency in each terrain (sky, ground, sea
                     and space), rated from "A" to "D", where "A" means this
                     is where the unit acts to its full potential.

 Size                The unit's size, from "S" (small) to "LL" (very large).
                     Smaller units have better chances to dodge attacks.

 Shuuri  (Repair)    The money necessary to repair the unit if destroyed.
                     If you destroy an enemy robot, you receive half of its
                     repair value as a reward.

 Idouryoku           The amount of squares this unit can cover in one single
         (Mobility)  move.

 Undousei (Agility)  Added to the pilot aim and evade values, determines the 
                     unit's chance to hit enemies and avoid enemy attacks.

 Soukou  (Armor)     The unit's armor strenght. Higher armor means the robot
                     will sustain less damage on every attack suffered.

 Genkai  (Limit)     The unit's maximum sustainable response.
                     If a pilot's hit or evade rate (unit agility included)
                     is higher than the unit's Limit, the exceeding values
                     are disconsidered.
                     (i.e.: if a unit's limit is 350 and the pilot's hit
                     rate is 400, then in effect the pilot's hit rate is
                     350, because the unit can't stand more than this.)



3 - Weapon Status
-----------------

   Each of the weapons has characteristics of their own as well, which deter-
mine the amount of damage inflicted to their targets, the chance they have to
hit the enemy, et cetera.


 Buki Na             The attack's name; the symbol to the left indicates its
 (Weapon Name)       type: a target-like icon means it is a shooting weapon,
                     while a fist indicates it is a fighting attack.

                     A (P) symbol after the name indicates the attack can be
                     used after the unit moved; (B) indicates a beam weapon
                     (affectable by anti-beam measures). An (M) symbol means
                     it's a MAP weapon, able to hit several enemies at once.

 Kougeki (Attack)    The attack's strenght. Obviously, the higher it is, the
                     more damage the weapon can cause.

 Shatei  (Range)     The attack's minimum and maximum ranges, in squares. If
                     its range is 1, the attack is considered "short-range";
                     all others are "long-range".

 Meichuu (Hit)       A percent bonus to your robot's hit rate. Basically, an
                     attack with +10 Meichuu has 15% more chance to hit than
                     one with a -5 Meichuu value.

 Zandan              The amount of ammo available to this attack. Dashes in-
 (Remaining Shots)   dicate the weapon has no ammo limitations.

 Terrain Grades      The attack's efficiency on each terrain. A dash indica-
                     tes the attack can't hit enemies on that terrain.

 Hitsuyou Kiryoku    A pilot must gather a specific amount of kiryoku to use
 (Required Vitality) certain attacks. Until the pilot has at least this much
                     kiryoku, the attack is not available.

 Hitsuyou EN         Some attacks spend a certain amount of energy each time
 (Required Energy)   they are used. If that's the case, the amount it spends
                     is displayed here.

 Required Skill      The special pilot skill necessary to use this attack.
                     Only Newtype or SeiSenshi may be required to perform
                     attacks, and very few attacks need them - those that
                     do, however, are very powerful.
                     Notice some attacks may also require a certain level to
                     this skill (i.e.: Hyper Aura Giri needs SeiSenshi Lv3).

 Critical            A bonus to the unit's critical hit rate. Simply put, an
                     attack with +20% has 20% more chance to make a critical
                     hit than an attack with +0% Critical.


   Making good use of your weapons is essential in this game. For example, an
attack with high energy comsumption should be saved for the strongest enemies
- these attacks are often the most powerful and cannot be used constantly.



4 - Upgrading
-------------

   During every intermission, you can upgrade your robots' status and weapons
to improve their performance. Each upgrade costs money, and you are given the
choice of upgrading several different aspects of each robot.

   The more upgrades you do on a unit's given characteristic, the more expen-
sive it becomes. Each category can be upgraded up to ten times. The following
tables show the prices charged for each upgrade, as well as the upgrading va-
lue you get for each category, each time (in parenthesis).


          |                               Costs
          |       1            2            3            4            5
 HP       |  $2000 (200)  $4000 (200)  $6000 (200)  $8000 (200) $10000 (200)
 EN       |  $1000 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)
 Agility  |  $5000 (  5)  $8000 (  5) $10000 (  5) $12000 (  5) $15000 (  5)
 Armor    |  $3000 (100)  $5000 (100)  $8000 (100) $10000 (100) $15000 (100)
 Limit    |  $1000 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $1500 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)  $2000 ( 10)


          |                               Costs
          |       6            7            8            9           10
 HP       | $18000 (200) $20000 (200) $25000 (200) $30000 (200) $35000 (200)
 EN       |  $5000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $15000 ( 20) $20000 ( 20) $30000 ( 20)
 Agility  | $20000 (  5) $24000 (  5) $28000 (  5) $32000 (  5) $37000 (  5)
 Armor    | $23000 (150) $27000 (150) $30000 (150) $32000 (150) $33000 (200)
 Limit    |  $5000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20) $10000 ( 20)


   If you upgrade all status categories of one unit to the max, you are awar-
ded an extra prize - you can give your unit one of the following bonuses:


 - Change its terrain grading to "A" in any terrain you choose;
 - Increase its Mobility by 1 point;
 - Increase its Max HP by 2000 points;
 - Increase its Max Energy by 150 points;
 - Increase its Agility by 20 points;
 - Increase its Armor by 500 points.


   Weapons too can be upgraded, but you can only increase their attack power.
There are three different price tables: a cheaper one for weaker attacks, one
table for medium-powered weapons, and another one for stronger moves.


          |                               Costs
          |       1            2            3            4            5
 Weaker   |  $2000 (100)  $4000 (100)  $6000 (150)  $8000 (150) $10000 (150)
 Medium   |  $4000 (100)  $8000 (100) $12000 (150) $16000 (150) $20000 (150)
 Strong   |  $5000 (100) $10000 (100) $15000 (150) $20000 (150) $25000 (200)


          |                               Costs
          |       6            7            8            9           10
 Weaker   | $14000 (150) $26000 (150) $35000 (150) $40000 (200) $45000 (200)
 Medium   | $24000 (150) $38000 (200) $45000 (200) $55000 (200) $65000 (300)
 Strong   | $35000 (200) $50000 (200) $60000 (200) $70000 (300) $80000 (300)


   So, strong weapons are extremely expensive to upgrade, but also yield more
value, especialy in the higher end. Therefore, it is important to choose with
care what weapons and units to upgrade, since it is bound to cost a lot.



5 - Items
---------

   Items are external parts or accessories that can be attached to your units
in order to improve their performance, add new functionality or provide HP or
energy refills.

   Items are awarded as stage clear bonuses after each scenario is completed.
You will also receive one extra item once you finish all 'choice' stages (the
scenarios you can pick in any order you want), and another one when you clear
an entire scene; the extra items you receive are determined by which scenario
you left for last. So, postponing certain scenarios helps you have a slightly
better item collection.

   At the walkthrough, I will describe, at each scenario, the extra items you
will receive if you leave that stage for last (under the "If Last" line). The
items you'll be given to you regardless of the order you choose are marked on
the 'Always' line on each scenario.

   Now, a brief description of all items in the game:


 Booster                Mobility + 1
 Mega Booster           Mobility + 2
 Magnet Coating         Agility + 5, Limit + 20
 BioSensor              Agility + 10, Limit + 15
 Psycho Frame           Agility + 15, Limit + 30
 Apogee Motor           Mobility + 1, Agility + 5
 Haro                   Mobility + 2, Agility + 20, Limit + 30
 Chobham Armor          Max HP + 500, Armor + 150
 Chou Goukin Z          Max HP + 1000, Armor + 300
 Chou Goukin New-Z      Max HP + 1500, Armor + 400
 Large Generator        Max EN + 100
 Repair Kit S           Heals all HP. Once used, it is discarded
 Propellant Tank S      Refills 200 EN. Once used, it is discarded
 Minovsky Craft         Turns any unit into an Air/Ground type. Also changes
                        its "air" grade to "A"
 High Efficiency Radar  Increases all weapon's max range by 1.
                        (except short-range and MAP weapons)
 Seishin Energy Device  Starting kiryoku + 5
 Anti-Beam Coating      Equips unit with Beam Coat.
 V-Up Unit              Version up unit. Increases all weapons' attack power


   For V-Up Units the attack power increase the unit gets depends on how many
item slots it has:


                      1 Item Slot : attack power + 100
                      2 Item Slots: attack power + 200
                      3 Item Slots: attack power + 400
                      4 Item Slots: attack power + 800


   Usually, units with four item slots are older, weaker units, which can get
an extra life via V-Up Units; for example, High Mobility Zaku. As such, these
units can be good choices even in later levels, as their V-Upped attack power
may actually surpass those of newer units.



6 - Special Pilot Skills
------------------------

   Most pilots have special skills, which are displayed in the "Pilot Status"
screen. You can't choose when to use these skills: either they are constantly
active or the game decides when they are activated.

   In this game there are two kinds of pilot skills: natural and learned. Na-
tural skills are given to each pilot by the game itself, and cannot be obtai-
ned any other way. These are the natural skills available:


 Newtype                Mobile suit pilots only.
                        - Allows the pilot to use newtype weapons.
                        - Increases the pilot's hit and evade rates.
                          (the higher the level, the better the bonus)
                        - When the pilot reaches Newtype Level 7 or higher,
                          'Funnels' and 'Bits' have their range increased.
                          (the higher the level, the higher the range bonus)

 Kyouka Ningen          Mobile suit pilots only. Same effect as newtype.
 (Enhanced Human)

 Bougyo (Defense)       - Allows the pilot to defend incoming attacks with a
                          shield (if the unit has it), reducing the suffered
                          damage by half.
                        - If the robot carries a melee weapon, the pilot can
                          slash incoming solid attacks (missiles or funnels,
                          for example) or fence off melee attacks.
                        The level of this skill indicates the frequency it's
                        activated (frequency = level number / 16).

 Sokodikara             When a unit's HP is lower than 1/8 of its total, its
 (Potential)            chances of making a critical hit are increased by 50
                        percent points.

 Zouen (Support)        Allows the pilot to do support attacks/defenses.


   Learned skills are awarded to you when you clear a scenario in 11 turns or
less. The following table shows what skill you get according to the number of
turns spent:


              Turns                        Skill
           -------------------------------------------------------
            6 or less       ShuuchuuRyoku (Concentration Power)
                7                  SensouShin (War Heart)
                8                   Seishin Points + 20
                9                      Hit Rate + 20
               10                   Critical Rate + 20
               11                 Sokodikara (Potential)


   You can choose the pilot, subpilot, or faerie to assign your new skill to
among those who fought in the scenario you gained the skill at. These are the
available learned skills:


 ShuuchuuRyoku          All of the pilot's seishins have their Seishin Point
 (Concentration Power)  (SP) consumption reduced by 20%.

 SensouShin             Starting kiryoku + 5 (the pilot starts each scenario
 (War Heart)            with 105 ki instead of 100).

 Seishin Points + 20    Max SP + 20

 Hit Rate + 20          The pilot's hit rate rises by 20 percent points.

 Critical Rate + 20     His/Her critical rate rises by 20 percent points.

 Sokodikara             When a unit's HP is lower than 1/8 of its maximum,
 (Potential)            the chance of making a critical hit (damage x 1.5)
                        rises by 50 percent points.


   Notice Sokodikara is available both as a natural and a learned skill. Each
pilot has four slots to allocate skills at, and learned skills cannot replace
natural ones. Since pilots have up to three natural skills, allocating skills
wisely is necessary not to waste them.



7 - Special Robot Skills
------------------------

   Like pilots, some units have built-in capabilities. Unlike pilots, you can
choose when to use them or not, or they are constantly activated. The availa-
ble robot skills are:


 Bunshin (Branching)    If the pilot's kiryoku is 130 or more, the unit gets
                        a 50% chance to escape any enemy attack it fails to
                        evade.

 Henkei (Transform)     Indicates the unit can transform.

 Bunri (Separation)     The unit can break down into a smaller unit (after
                        which it can't revert to its previous form).

 Gasshin (Attach)       If he pilot's kiryoku is 130 or more, the unit can
                        attach extra parts, transforming into a different,
                        new unit (Kenryuu only).

 Beam Coat              An anti-beam measure that completely absorbs Beam
                        attacks meant to cause up to 1000 HP of damage, at
                        the expense of 5 EN. Stronger attacks can pierce
                        the coating, in which case the unit suffers the
                        exceeding damage.

 I-Field                Anti-beam measure. Same as above, but fully absorbs
                        up to 2000 HP of damage.

 HP Kaifuku             Every turn, the unit has a certain percentage of its
 (HP Healing)           HP healed ('Low' heals 10% and 'High' heals 30%).



8 - Seishins
------------

   Seishins are spells pilots can use in order to gain extra temporary skills
or simply help them survive through tough spots. When used, seishins spend SP
(Seishin Points), and the amount of SP consumed varies according to the spell
you are calling for.

   Each pilot has up to six seishins (out of 30), learned at computer-defined
levels. A pilot's max SP depends on one's level (the higher, the more SP) and
type (Super Robot pilots tend to have more SP than mobile suit ones).

   For each pilot there are five different possible seishin sets, assigned by
the game according to the personal information you inserted at the Wonderswan
'Personal Data' screen. During battles, the seishins available can be seen in
the "Seishin Lookup" menu, and are presented as follows:

their battle effectiveness, while pilots of support units have seishins aimed
at healing allied units or hurting enemy stats.



WALKTHROUGH------------------------------------------------------------------


   Universal Century 00XX.

   The Earth Sphere was in chaos.


   After the One Year War, the official Zeon remnant hunters Titans ran out
of control. In the end, in the fight known as "Gryps War", Paptimus Scirocco
saw his ambition of seizing the entire Earth Sphere with Neo Zeon fouled by
Bright Noa's Argama Team.

   Underneath this war, there were those who still insisted on fighting...

   Dr. Hell, a scientist planning to conquer the confusion-ridden world;
   The tragic cyborgs created by human technology - Meganoids;
   Former inhabitants of the Earth, the underground Dinosaur Empire;
   And space's Muge Zorbados Empire in an attempt of conquering the cosmos.

   Thanks to the "Super Robots", machines boasting a literally immense power,
all these nearly-simultaneous disturbances ended in victory.


   ...but even so the Earth Sphere was in chaos.


   Just when everything seemed to have returned to normality, the Union Army
high command does a thoughtless armament curtailment. Immediately after that,

   a new invader, the Great King Vega-led Vega Alliance Army, enters;
   The once suppressed Axis - Neo Zeon - reincarnates;
   And the mysterious destroyer Guyzock starts moving.

   The storm of war is raging again, Earth in its very center. The events to
result from these successive incidents, and what "power" is in motion to drag
the entire universe into them... are, as of now, unknown to anyone.


   Universal Century 00XX.

   In charge of the near space's defense, the Union's Independent Raid Squad
Londo Bell receives an urgent message: ..."an invading army is attacking".



Scene 1: "Invasion"
===================

 First:   Luna Two Vicinities         ->  Scenario 1
 Choice:  Earth Vicinities            ->  Scenario 2
 Choice:  Moon Vicinit. - Debris Area ->  Scenario 3
 Choice:  Space - Colony Area         ->  Scenario 4
 Last:    Earth Vicinities            ->  Scenario 5


   The timing of the Vega Alliance Army's invasion couldn't be worse: right
after the Gryps War - almost as if invited by the armament reduction program.
While the invaders are probably raiding space colonies and other facilities,
the Londo Bell is looking for reinforcements to raise its own fighting power.
Unfortunately, Luna Two, already attacked by the aliens, has no mobile suits
left to spare, leaving you with only Quattro's Hyakushiki, Kou's GP-01Fb, and
Emma's Gundam Mk-II.

   In addition, there's also the alien super robot 'Grendizer' and its pilot
Duke Freed - who, having adopted Earth as his new home planet, can also go by
the name Daisuke Umon.

   Even though Von Braun City and Anaheim Electronics are at the Moon, it is
possible a fortress could be built there unnoticed. And, since their ultimate
objective is the Earth, the Vegas would really like a frontline base in such
a place. Therefore, investigating the Moon is an absolute imperative - if you
do find an alien base there, you will be able to take the initiative for the
first time.

                                    ****

   The only new pilot Bright's received so far is Execellen Browning, a test
pilot just promoted into regular service. She brings in the 'Weissritter', an
experimental upgrade of the 'Gespenst Mk-II' mass-production model. Even she
admits it doesn't have much of an output, but is by no means a weakling - and
for the Londo Bell any help is welcome right now.

                                    ****

   Koutarou Hadzuki is the boss of the Beast Battle Squad, a team famous for
having, during the last conflicts, invaded alone the Muge Zorbados Empire and
defeated its emperor. Its Dancouga is the only super robot under the control
of the Union Army, but there were others, such as Mazinger Z and Getter Robo,
that also became known during the same period. Unfortunately, civilian mechs
are no longer permitted to function.

   Knowing the Londo Bell won't receive reinforcements any time soon (Bright
can't contact Jaburo, supposedly because of a Zeon jamming), Hadzuki proposes
sending Dancouga over, but Bright can't accept soldiers from other squadrons
without superior permission. And since Jaburo's unreachable...

   In response to Bright's concerns, Hadzuki suggests the Beast Battle Squad
could simply... go to the Londo Bell anyway, disobeying its orders to stay on
Earth. Now, that's the kind of disregard-the-military thinking that made the
Beast Battle Squad's reputation.

   In return for the much needed help, Bright shares a piece of information
with Hadzuki: the newbie pilots assigned to the Gundoll and Londo Bell may be
both survivors of 'that incident'. The decision of having them promoted into
regular service may have no particular meaning (after all, they are both good
pilots), but having it right in the middle of the armament reduction program
left Bright suspicious - that's something he and Hadzuki will have to look at
in the future.

                                    ****

   Upon seeing Execellen nearing Grendizer, Duke quickly warns her to keep a
distance: merely approaching it can trigger its self-defense systems. Because
Grendizer was meant to be Planet Freed's guardian deity, this safety measure
was adopted to prevent it from being misused.

                                    ****

   Duke's younger sister Maria has weak precognitive abilities. So, when she
says she's feeling apprehensive, it's not surprising to learn the Vega troops
have started a wide-scale move, apparently to expand their campaign into new
areas; their most probable next target is a dense colony cluster not far from
the Moon.

   Because Jaburo's still unreachable, no bases have been authorized to send
troops to engage the enemies - therefore, they'll just sit on their hands and
watch the Londo Bell (the only independent squad in the region) fight.

   In addition, there are unconfirmed reports of a reconaissance ship having
been destroyed while scouting a debris field above the dark side of the Moon.
It's very unlikely that machine was hit by an asteroid, so you must check on
that too.

   To top it all, an unidentified ship is detected heading towards the Earth
- because he thinks there's no army on the Earth surface capable of resisting
an invasion, Bright'll have to have the Londo Bell stop all of that...



Scenario 1 (Luna Two Vicinities) - "Sortie"
-------------------------------------------
32x40, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 6 (all available units)
Initial Enemy Formation: Zaku-III [Mashymre] Lv10
                         Dreissen Lv06 x02
                         Zaku Kai Lv05 x02
                         Zssa Lv04 x03
                         Zaku Kai Lv04 x04
Clear Bonus - Always: Repair Kit S, Magnet Coating
Events: Zaku-III's HP below 50% - Mashymre leaves


   Before Bright gets to choose where to go first, the Zeons attack: they've
been following the Vega Alliance Troops, to easily conquer the weakened bases
the invaders left defeated.

   Mashymre says your pre-Gryps War mobile suits pose no threats to his men,
but the truth is his troops don't have the most up-to-date equipment either -
for example, the Zaku Kais are awfully weak. The only problem is they're all
scattered around the field, meaning you may have to divide your forces. Don't
waste much time on the Zakus, and have people always moving towards Mashymre
or you'll spend too many turns.

   The only difficult enemy is Mashymre himself, and he runs away as soon as
you take half of his HP away, promising you haven't seen the last of him. Kou
volunteers to chase him, but you can't afford to let your battle power lower
even further.

   This battle lets clear you won't last long without repair device-equipped
units. Turns out Bright can provide something: a transformable Methuss mobile
suit is, as he speaks, being assembled on Luna Two. It's made out of surplus
parts, so don't expect much of it - but it's better than nothing.



Scenario 2 (Earth Vicinities) - "Menace of the Destroyer"
---------------------------------------------------------
40x40, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 7 (Ral Kairam + 6)
Initial Enemy Formation: Bandock [Butcher] Lv12
                         MechaBoost Tracid Lv07 x04
                         MechaBoost Gabitan Lv07 x03
                         MechaBoost Gabitan Lv06 x06
Enemy Reinforcements: Devil Saturn 6 [No.1] Lv11
                      Chasmodon [Chasmodon] Lv07 x02
                      Zarios [Zarios] Lv07 x01
                      Falgos [Falgos] Lv07 x01
                      Zarios [Zarios] Lv06 x01
                      Falgos [Falgos] Lv06 x01
Clear Bonus - Always: Propellant Tank S, Apogee Motor
              If Last: Magnet Coating (after scenario end)
                       Repair Kit S (after scene end)
Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive (optional)
        Bandock's HP below 90% - Killer the Butcher leaves
        Devil Saturn 6's HP below 50% - No.1 leaves


   The unidentified object flying towards the Earth is a ship: one gigantic,
ugly battleship. The 'Guyzock' army's hostile intentions become clear as they
immediately launch their units against you - they cannot be allowed into the
Earth.

   The Gabitans will be easily beaten with two or three shots from any unit,
while the Tracids demand a little more effort (but not much). So, this battle
has everything to be very easy - unless you have already cleared Scenario 4.
In this case, the unknown enemies met there come again on Turn 3, just to pay
back their previous defeat. Getting no reinforcements this time, you will be
heavily outnumbered, but you have no choice other than beating them all.

   The Bandock has 25000 HP and strong, long-ranged weapons, but fighting it
is easy because you only need to take 1/10 of its HP for Butcher to decide to
run away - into the Earth atmosphere. As with Mashymre, you cannot afford to
have anybody pursue him, so the next best thing will have to suffice: destroy
all other MechaBoosts before they follow their leader.

   Given the reduced battle power the Londo Bell has, you're very lucky only
one enemy got through. Now, you must trust the Gundoll Team will handle this,
while hoping to get a few more units soon enough.



Scenario 3 (Near the Moon - Debris Area) - "Warrior from the Moon"
------------------------------------------------------------------


   This scenario changes depending on when you play it. If you chose to play
it as first or second, go to Scenario 3-1; if you play it as third (last), go
to 3-2 instead.



Scenario 3-1 (Near the Moon - Debris Area) - "Warrior from the Moon"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
32x40, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 7 (GP-03S Stamen, Ral Kairam + 5)
Initial Enemy Formation: Minifoe Lv07 x12
                         Saucer Beast Deki-Deki Lv06 x04
                         Saucer Beast Giru-Giru Lv06 x04
Enemy Reinforcements: Saucer Beast Deki-Deki Lv06 x02
                      Saucer Beast Giru-Giru Lv06 x02
Clear Bonus - Always: Cartridge, Booster
Events: Turn 4, Player Phase - GP-03S Stamen appears
                               Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   Informed about an upcoming Vega Alliance raid, the Londo Bell goes to the
Moon to prepare an ambush. Hiding behind asteroids, the Ral Kairam managed to
approach the Vegas undetected: because they take a while to notice you, they
won't move for the first turn.

   The Vegas call for reinforcements the second they see the Londo Bell, but
these will only arrive on Turn 4. Before that, you receive a little help: the
"Gundam Prototype 3" (GP-03S) built by Anaheim's Nina Purpleton, and brought
to you by Elle Vianno.

   Even with the enemy reinforcements, the battle isn't so hard, but demands
you to spread your units in all directions (because they're so scattered). Of
course, send most units against the Saucer Beasts at the bottom of the map -
even a single robot can take care of one Minifoe wing, and whoever fights the
left one can later go reinforce Elle.

   Nina once told Kou the Gundam Prototype 3 was still far from completion -
what Elle brought is only the part of it that can function as a normal mobile
suit. Though bad things are often said about Anaheim Electronics, you cannot
deny a new unit is most helpful at this moment.



Scenario 3-2 (Near the Moon - Debris Area) - "Warrior from the Moon"
--------------------------------------------------------------------
32x40, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 7 (GP-03S Stamen, Ral Kairam + 5)

Clear Bonus - Always: Cartridge, Booster
              As Last: Anti-Beam Coating (after scenario end)
                       Cartridge (after scene end)
Events: Turn 4, Player Phase - GP-03S Stamen appears
                               Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   Informed about an upcoming Vega Alliance raid, the Londo Bell goes to the
Moon to prepare an ambush. However, by the time you arrive there are no signs
of enemy activity; because you're a little late, you first guess the enemies
already passed through, but Nina reports no incidents at the Moon.

   Suddenly, the Vegas do attack: warned about the Londo Bell's existance by
Commander Gorman, they delayed their offensive a little, in order to surprise
you. So, their plan worked, yours didn't: you start this scenario completely
surrounded (and their reinforcements are already on the way), but the enemies
aren't difficult at all.

   On Turn 4, you receive reinforcements (at last): the "Gundam Prototype 3"
(GP-03S) built by Anaheim's Nina Purpleton and brought to you by Elle Vianno.
As Saucer Beasts pop up just after her, Elle's forced to join the battle.

   Even with the enemy reinforcements, the battle isn't so hard, but demands
you to spread your units in all directions (because they're so scattered). Of
course, send most units against the Saucer Beasts at the bottom of the map -
even a single robot can take care of one Minifoe wing, and whoever fights the
left and top ones can later go reinforce Elle.

   Nina once told Kou the Gundam Prototype 3 was still far from completion -
what Elle brought is only the part of it that can function as a normal mobile
suit. Though bad things are often said about Anaheim Electronics, you cannot
deny a new unit is most helpful at this moment.



Scenario 4 (Space - Colony Area) - "Revolving Storm - The Fists of Justice"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
32x32, Space
Goal: Protect your mothership
Player Units: 11 (Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill, Triple Jim (Heli)
                  Grendizer, Ral Kairam + 5)

              If Last: Booster (after scenario end)
                       Propellant Tank S (after scene end)
Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
                              Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill,
                              Triple Jim (Heli) appear
        Devil Saturn 6's HP below 50% - No.1 leaves


   The 'crossed star' shaped mark on the side of the enemy battleship is the
symbol of Great King Vega's personal guard, whose presence here indicates the
Vegas are serious about invading the Earth. Upon seeing the responsibles for
Planet Freed's destruction, Duke launches out before Bright even has a chance
of ordering it.

   Between the awfully weak Minifoes and the poor aiming Saucer Beasts, this
battle should be easy until Turn 3, when a third faction, unknown to both you
and the Vegas, comes... and immediately sides with your enemies. Questioned,
their leader explains they only mean to remove the obstacles between them and
the 'treasure' Earth hides.

   When Devil Saturn No.1 says the large, green lands Duke calls 'treasures'
will be burned away in the search for the real treasure, a voice warns "those
who can't understand the beauty of a flower cannot understand things such as
the value of treasures", and that real treasures are inside one's heart.

   A surprised Kou tells Bright to look up, but it takes the captain a while
to understand what he means: the voice is coming from a man - a man standing,
without any space gear, on the top of the Ral Kairam's bridge! As he summons
friends that seem to appear out of nowhere, he never tells his name, but No.1
knows Rom from before.

   When Rom's kiryoku rises to 130 points (probably won't happen here unless
you use seishins), his 'Kenryuu' robot can attach some extra parts and become
the mighty 'Vi-Kung-Fu', which would make this stage much easier, especially
when fighting Devil Saturn (12000 HP) and Gorman's Mothership (17000 HP).

   After the battle, the crew thanks the newcomers (let's call them 'Machine
Robo Team', for ease's sake) for the much needed help, but don't get to learn
anything about them, even their names; they just say they only chose to help
you because they imagine those who love the greenery probably aren't evil. As
they leave to chase Devil Saturn, the only thing you can guess about them is
that they're aliens - they refer to you as being "from another world"...



Scenario 5 (Earth Vicinities) - "Inexperienced-Hearted Visitors"

        Turn 3, Player Phase - Tobikage appears
                               Tobikage, Elshank, Kuroshishi,
                               Bakuryuu, Hourai-Ou leave

        Ten or less enemies - Gil leaves
        Bloody I defeated - Bloody II arrives


   After the battle against the Titans, Judau Ashta, pilot of the ZZ-Gundam,
joined the 'Jupitris II' resource fleet - responsible for collecting Helium-3
from the Jupiter atmosphere. The reason he and his girlfriend Roux Louka are
following Paptimus Scirocco's steps is unclear even to friends like Elle.

                                    ****

   Because the Gundams are very standardized, they normally come out looking
very similar. But the Gundam Prototype 3 is different: each of its parts seem
to be unique, suggesting it features a functionality just as unique. Judging
by its hip stabilizers, maybe it can switch or attach extra parts...

                                    ****

   Responding to the Londo Bell's troubles, captain South Burning comes from
Side 7 in a Gundam Mk-II. Unlike Emma's one, however, this Mk-II comes in the
Titans dark color scheme - consequence of being built from spare parts taken
from the Titans' former Green Oasis headquarters.

   Still heavily outnumbered, Bright contacts Hadzuki to confirm the sending
of Dancouga to space. During that call, he receives good news: as his enemies
don't seem to outnumber the Gundoll Team by much, Hadzuki is willing to send
one Mazinger Team as well! - despite the army's ban on civilian super robots,
professor Yumi kept the Mazingers always ready for battle.

   When telling Hadzuki about the people that assisted the Londo Bell during
a battle, Bright says he thinks they are members of a volunteer army from the
colonies. He later confesses he was afraid of what Hadzuki would think if he
said he was saved by an alien 'ally of justice' that showed up, unnoticed, at
the top of the Ral Kairam's bridge.

                                    ****

   An unidentified flying object is detected when it's already very close to
the Earth atmosphere. The Minovsky particle concentration in the area is low,
so there's no reason why it couldn't have been seen much earlier - it's like
it had suddenly just appeared there.

   Just then, Hazard Pasha calls from the 'Mars Colony Base' to warn about a
coming "mysterious battleship". He reports his base was recently attacked; he
first thought it was the Vega Alliance, but soon realized it was a brand new
enemy: the "Zaboom Army", planning to invade the Earth. Despite the terror he
felt, he somehow managed to repel them.

   An intercepted Zaboom transmission talked about an invasion weapon called
'Elshank' being sent towards the Earth. Though he himself never saw it, Pasha
is sure this can't be good and, as an Earth-loving person, is reporting this
menace, trusting the Londo Bell will destroy that demonic weapon.

                                    ****

   Only three minutes away from entering the Earth atmosphere, the Elshank's
crew has a problem: pursued by their enemies, starting the landing procedures
would make them easy targets. With no choice, Jou, Mike and Reny must launch
to hold the enemies back until the Elshank escapes.

   The Londo Bell arrives on Turn 2, still on time to take down the invaders
before they reach the Earth. Bright, however, can't help thinking something's
wrong with the story Hazard told, and hesitates about attacking the Elshank.
Unfortunately, an electromagnetic interference prevents him from establishing
contact with the aliens, so all he can do right now is fighting...

   Jou, Mike and Reny shouldn't have problems with the nearby enemies - have
them destroy or weaken as many as they can. The next turn, an incredibly fast
small ninja robot appears and beats the hell out of some enemies, paving the
road for the Elshank's escape. As usual, the presence of other enemies forces
the Londo Bell to let them go.

   On Turn 4, more enemies appear: a combined group of the "Gyandra" faction
you've fought earlier, joined by some never-seen-before machines from a force
called "Bangar". Even though Devil Saturn No.1 advised him to take care with
the Londo Bell, the Bangar leader Gil just sees you as something to slaughter
en route to his true objectives. He's quickly berated by Rom, who apparently
pops out of nowhere (again) and reinforces you against Gyandra.

   The Bloody I boasts 24000 HP and, when beaten, spawns the agile Bloody II
(20000 HP). The good news is you don't have to fight it if you don't want to:
Gil decides to cancel his atmospheric entry as soon as there are ten enemies
left. So, if you want to shoot Gil down (both Bloodies are worth good money),
you'll also have to keep a few enemies alive.

   If you defeat Gil, he runs away just the same; Reina wants to pursue him,
but Rom warns the "space pirates", being connected to Gyandra, are not likely
to be beaten so easily - in this case, they better worry about defeating the
current enemies.

   After the battle, the Kenryuu's sword starts to shine, which Rom takes as
a signal he has to leave - once again, you didn't learn anything about him or
his friends, other than the fact he mentioned to be in a mission.



Scene 2: "Invaders"
===================

 Choice:  Inside an Abandoned Colony  ->  Scenario 6
 Choice:  Space - Earth Vicinities 1  ->  Scenario 7
 Choice:  Space - Earth Vicinities 2  ->  Scenario 8
 Choice:  Mysterious Stone Circle     ->  Scenario 9
 Last:    Moon Vicinities             ->  Scenario 10


   That Guyzock battleship that escaped from the Londo Bell interferred with
Hadzuki's sending of reinforcements into space: the HLV that was carrying the
Beast Battle Squad and Mazinger Team has gone missing. The Gundoll currently
doesn't have any robots capable of following the HLV's steps, so you can only
hope your friends are fine.

   For what matters, Hadzuki doesn't believe it was taken down: Fujiwara and</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
the others wouldn't let that happen without resisting. Besides, 'Zanbot 3', a
super robot by a family that predicted the Guyzock invasion, also went after
the enemy battleship.

   Hadzuki also tells the Gundoll lost track of the 'paper crane' battleship
during the fight against its robot entourage. Too bad - capturing the Elshank
would help answering a few questions - but Hadzuki has other worries anyway:
once fallen underground empires are invading again, not to mention an unknown
army showing up from who-knows-where.

                                    ****

   Upon learning Gil is aiming at the Earth - probably because of her -, Mia
decides she must return to her homeworld and protect it, despite Dr. Tarsan's
objections. Her fellow 'Dangaioh Team' members won't abandon her.

                                    ****

   At last, you receive a rescue signal from the Mazinger Team's HLV. At the
same time, Bright notices the Guyzock battleship's signal in a different area
- that's good news, actually: it means it has left the Earth surface.

   There is also a strange gravity field not far from your current position.
Since it's not off-course, you can afford to go investigate it while going to
the other locations. Now, Bright only has to decide where to go first...



Scenario 6 (Inside an Abandoned Colony) - "Demon of Anger"
----------------------------------------------------------
24x32, Colony
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 12 (Great Mazinger (Mazinger Z), Byuunas A (Aphrodi A),
                  BozBorot, Grendizer, Ral Kairam + 7)

Clear Bonus - Always: Cartridge, Apogee Motor
              If Last: BioSensor (after scenario end)
                       Propellant Tank S (after scene end)
Events: Turn 3, Player Phase - Londo Bell sortie
        Turn 4, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   The HLV that brought reinforcements into space managed to break away from
its pursuer, but at the expense of its meeting with the Londo Bell. Sheltered
at an abandoned space colony, the Mazinger Team must wait for the Ral Kairam
to pick them up. Unfortunately, the enemy shows up first.

   [NOTE: whichever Mazinger Team you had sent to space on Part 1 is the one
that appears here. If you didn't transfer data from Episode 1, you'll get the
Great Mazinger team. Furthermore, if, on Part 1's Scenario 6, you managed to
destroy the Bandock before it got to run away, your new units will have a few
upgrades already.]

   Your Mazinger (Z or Great) is powerful enough to cause major damage while
suffering very little, but you can't say the same about its support units, so
keep them far from the enemy. The Londo Bell arrives on Turn 3, turning this
into your easiest battle so far - even the enemy reinforcements that come one
turn later (by the top left and bottom right ends of the space colony) won't
change that.

   After the battle, you learn the Beast Battle Squad went missing: in order
to intercept the Guyzock battleship that pursued their pod, they launched out
still in the stratosphere. It's common for them to jump into a fight in such
a reckless manner and, if well-adjusted, Dancouga can perform in any airspace
- but Dancouga was known to be misadjusted.



Scenario 7 (Space - Earth Vicinities 1) - "The Targeted Blue Planet"
--------------------------------------------------------------------


   This scenario changes depending on when you play it. If you chose to play
it as first or second, go to Scenario 7-1; if you play it as third or fourth,
go to 7-2 instead.



Scenario 7-1 (Space - Earth Vicinities 1) - "The Targeted Blue Planet"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
40x40, Space
Goal: Protect your mothership
Player Units: 12 (Dangaioh, Ral Kairam + 10)
Initial Enemy Formation: Bloody I [Gil] Lv16
                         Sky Tank Lv11 x07
                         Sky Tank Lv10 x08
Enemy Reinforcements: Aizam the Third Lv14 x01
                      Sky Tank Lv11 x03
                      Sky Tank Lv10 x02
Clear Bonus - Always: Magnet Coating, Chobham Armor
Events: Turn 3, Player Phase - Dangaioh appears
        Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Bloody I's HP below 40% - Gil leaves
                                  Dangaioh leaves


   Space pirate Gil is about to make a second atmospheric entry attempt, but
finds you on his way again. The Sky Tanks feel much stronger than before, and
come in high numbers.

   On Turn 3, Gil is already confident he'll make it this time, but Dangaioh
suddenly appears to stop him. Mia Alice begs Gil to stop bothering the Earth,
as his only quarrel is against her, but he answers he will only be satisfied
if she dies when she's most desperate - when her homeworld is torn.

   Later on Turn 3, in response to Dangaioh's interference, Gil launches the
new Bangar model: the 'Aizam the Third' - not as good as the Bloody, but much
superior than the Sky Tanks. It has a pretty decent HP and good attacks, but
isn't impossible at all.

   The Bloody I is just a little improved over the first time you battled it
(24200 HP), but this time Gil runs away into the Earth once you take over 60%
of his life - most pilots think it's suicidal to take a damaged machine into
an atmospheric entry, but Kou and Quattro quickly realize that mech can stand
it.

   To pursue Gil, Dangaioh breaks up into four smaller mechs that leave into
the Earth as well. By now, you could afford to put together a pursue team and
go after him too, but the only units that can do atmospheric entries are the
Ral Kairam and Grendizer - Bright won't give up either of these.



Scenario 7-2 (Space - Earth Vicinities 1) - "The Targeted Blue Planet"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
40x40, Space
Goal: Protect your mothership
Player Units: 16 (Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill, Triple Jim (Heli),
                  Ral Kairam + 11)
Initial Enemy Formation: Devil Saturn 6 [No.1] Lv16

                         Falgos Lv11 x02
                         Zarios Lv10 x04
                         Falgos Lv10 x04
Enemy Reinforcements: Mizuchi [Mizuchi] Lv14
                      Chasmodon Lv10 x05
Clear Bonus - Always: Magnet Coating, Chobham Armor
              If Last: Booster (after scenario end)
                       Cartridge (after scene end)
Events: Turn 3, Player Phase - Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill,
                               Triple Jim (Heli) appear
        Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Bloody I's HP below 40% - Gil leaves
                                  Dangaioh leaves


   Gil's second attempt to enter the Earth goes flawlessly, as nobody showed
up to hinder - the Londo Bell comes in time only to fight his Gyandra escort.
Believing Devil Saturn's forces too are about to enter the Earth atmosphere,
Bright's determined not to let anybody else escape.

   On Turn 3, Bright detects several enemies approaching; facing these odds,
maybe the Londo Bell should leave, but all pilots dismiss the idea of letting
even more enemies into the Earth - where they'd certainly attack the Gundoll
Team. If there's time before these enemy reinforcements arrive, you must make
the most of it, they say.

   Pleased by the courage displayed by the Londo Bell, the Machine Robo Team
appears to back you. The previously mentioned enemy reinforcements come still
on Turn 3, led by 'Mizuchi' - an already defeated enemy brought back to life
by black magic. It has 'only' 11200 HP, nothing Rom can't handle.

   Devil Saturn has 12400 HP, but runs away as soon as left with 4960 points
(40%) or less. When that happens, Rom's party leaves too, following his enemy
in order to find the space pirates' headquarters. They again don't share any
information about themselves, and Rom says they won't join you anytime soon -
especially after you admit humans, unlike Rom's first impressions, willingly
kill each other.



Scenario 8 (Space - Earth Vicinities 2) - "A Path of Eternal Fighting"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
32x32, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 12 (Zanbot 3, Ral Kairam + 10)
Initial Enemy Formation: Bandock [Butcher] Lv16
                         MechaBoost Tracid Lv11 x03

                      MechaBoost Dangarn Lv10 x02 (optional)
Clear Bonus - Always: Propellant Tank S, Magnet Coating
              If Last: Large Generator (after scenario end)
                       Repair Kit S (after scene end)
Events: Turn 3, Player Phase - Londo Bell sortie
        Turn 4, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Bandock's HP below 30% - Killer the Butcher leaves


   The otherwise defenseless HLV escaped Killer the Butcher when "that funny
robot" launched from it. Unfortunately, Dancouga lost its balance when it was
shot, making the Beast Battle Squad disappear during its ascent, and leaving
only Zanbot 3 against Guyzock.

   You didn't have problems with the MechaBoosts when you first fought them,
but Zanbot 3 lacks the evade rate of a mobile suit, so it's bound to get shot
a lot - you'll probably have to use seishins to survive until the Londo Bell
arrives on Turn 3.

   Probably before the Londo Bell even gets to engage the MechaBoosts, their
reinforcements will appear behind you (if you play this battle as last, there
will be two extra Dangarns). Seeing enemies coming from somewhere other than
the Bandock - even featuring a new model mech - suggests Butcher's battleship
isn't the bulk of Guyzock's forces, like you first thought: instead, Guyzock
may be more like the Vegas, with headquarters elsewhere sending troops to its
Earth operations.

   This time, the Bandock runs away only when its HP drops below 30% (7500),
so it's possible to defeat it completely and collect good money and exp. When
put to run, Butcher confesses he too lost track of the HLV and Dancouga, but
says it doesn't really matter for him: even if they survived, they won't last
long - no humans will.

   Once you defeat all enemies, the Zanbot 3 Team (Kappei Jin, Uchuuta Kamie
and Keiko Kamikita) asks to join the Londo Bell, as they alone don't have the
power to defeat Guyzock. Bright isn't willing to let children into his team,
but is soon reminded he can't afford to refuse any help offered.

   [NOTE: if you imported your clear data from Part 1, and back then had the
Gundoll Team destroy the Bandock before it ran away (Scenario 6), you receive
a V-Up Unit when you finish this stage.]



Scenario 9 (Mysterious Stone Circle) - "Ring"
---------------------------------------------
32x32, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 12 (Weissritter, Grendizer, Ral Kairam + 9)
Initial Enemy Formation: none
Enemy Reinforcements (1): Einstglied Lv13 x16
Enemy Reinforcements (2): Einstknochen Lv14 x06
Clear Bonus - Always: Repair Kit S, Booster
              If Last: BioSensor (after scenario end)
                       Cartridge (after scene end)
Events: Turn 2, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (1) arrive
        All enemies defeated - Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive


   The uncommon gravity readings come from a ring-shaped meteorite formation
where there used to be a common asteroid belt. Detecting no enemy activities,
the Ral Kairam should move on, but Maria advises Duke to deploy immediately.
Trusting her precognitive abilities, he and Execellen do so; just to be safe,
Bright has everyone else follow.

   What Maria predicted appears only at Turn 2: a group of never-seen-before
units spread all over and inside the stone circle. Execellen hears them speak
something, but nobody else heard anything at all - they can't even establish
radio contact with these guys.

   Fight the Einstglieds from close: their short-range moves are weaker than
their long-range beam cannons, and are completely defenseless against range-2
weapons. Once you destroy all of them, more enemies show up at the center of
the ring - out of literally nowhere. By now, your pilots are high on kiryoku,
so these enemies should feel easier than the previous.

   These new enemies remain absolutely unknown to you - not only they didn't
respond to your calls, they also didn't display any heat signature, nor their
composition could be determined. Bright also failed to detect any life signs
coming from them...

Planet Bial's destruction by Guyzock. It's hard to believe these children are
aliens - then again, Duke and Maria look human too. For what they were told,
Guyzock seems to have no objective other than killing.

                                    ****

   Elle was quickly surrounded by enemies when taking the Gundam Prototype 3
to the Londo Bell. Warned about that, Roux Louka considers this only happened
because Elle was too slow and incompetent, and doesn't intend to worry about
that - pessimism only makes you age sooner, she says.

   Judau isn't going anywhere for now: the Double Zeta's experiencing energy
transmission issues and, since that Gundam is particularly dependant on that,
Nina won't let it take off until these problems are taken care of.

                                    ****

   The Londo Bell picks a distress signal from near the Moon: a single unit,
surrounded by Vega Alliance Army troops when coming from Anaheim Electronics.
Just like Elle.

                                    ****

   Confident even a newer suit like the one Roux's piloting won't be able to
resist for long, Commander Gorman plans to keep her alive only enough to lure
the Londo Bell - until then, his men will tear her robot apart.

   Use the debris to protect Roux - even the Minifoes can cause considerable
damage on the Z-Gundam, and more enemies come on Turn 2 already (all over the
top section of the map), including the new 'King-Gori' model, just to ensure
Roux won't escape.

   On the next turn, Gorman changes his plans: impressed with the Z-Gundam's
agility, he now intends to capture and personally present that machine to the
Great King Vega, who'll use it to build a new army. Now that he doesn't want
the Londo Bell to show up anymore, Gorman starts jamming Roux's SOS signal to
prevent them from finding her.

   When Roux refuses to surrender the mobile suit Kamille left his heart on,
Rom Stohl and friends appear to reward her efforts. They immediately put up a
new signal on a different frequency, and will fight by Roux's side until her
friends arrive (Turn 5). Have Triple Jim repair and reload the Z-Gundam while
the others engage the strongest Vega units (mainly those near Gorman and the
King-Goris), so they're weakened by the time the Ral Kairam comes.

   Gorman's Saucer Beast Gin-Gin boasts 15400 HP. It may not look like much,
but it has a shield that Gorman uses with an annoying frequence, cutting your
attacks' damage by half. Anyway, he leaves when his HP drops below 40%.



Scene 3: "Secret Maneuvers"

 Choice:  Dense Colony Area           ->  Scenario 11
 Choice:  Space - Planet Dirad        ->  Scenario 12
 Choice:  Inside Gate of Zedan        ->  Scenario 13

   During the development of its mass-produced version, Anaheim gathered and
reassembled the parts of the 'Zeta Gundam' Roux just brought you. By the way,
the mass-produced version, called 'Re-GZ', was sent to the Earth for testing
under a gravity environment.

   While celebrating the reinforcements received recently, your pilots can't
help mentioning the people that keep showing up suddenly to save you. They're
obviously aliens, given the fact they didn't wear space suits...

   For a moment, there's an energy reading coming from the Gate of Zedan, an
installation abandoned as a result of the armament reduction program. There's
also some activity going on by an abandoned space colony - an imminent enemy
attack?

                                    ****

   Far from its combined meeting point with the Londo Bell, the Beast Battle
Squad can't help worrying about the Mazinger Team's condition, but maybe they
should worry about their own first: Guyzock mechs are standing right next to
them! Hoping the enemies are just as lost as themselves (Butcher's battleship
is nowhere to be seen), the Beast Battle Squad puts up a distress signal and
waits for the rescue to come...

                                    ****

   The Beast Battle Squad's SOS signal is coming from the 'PLS Black Point',
a place recently crossed by a meteor swarm. Any unmanned reconaissance probes
sent there always suffer damage from one reason or another...

   You obviously won't let whatever the PLS Black Point's hiding prevent you
from rescuing the Beast Battle Squad, but you might not be able to do that so
soon: Bangar mechs are detected by some nearby colonies!

                                    ****

   Kyousuke calls Execellen to talk about the 'bone-like' mysterious enemies
she told him about earlier - because he too has met with them, and heard them
speak something nobody else could hear. Kyousuke suspects that, if only they
are able to hear their voices, the mysterious enemies must be somehow related
to the only thing he and Execellen have in common - 'that incident'.



Scenario 11 (Dense Colony Area) - "Spiral Knuckle of Tears"

Events: Turn 4, Player Phase - Londo Bell sortie
        Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Bloody I defeated - Bloody II arrives


   Pressed for results after repeated defeats, Gil Bag appears by some space
colonies to attract the Dangaioh Team - more specifically, Mia Alice - into a
place where he thinks the Earth defense forces won't interfere. Moreover, he
announces he has a surprise coming to make things more interesting...

   For Gil's disappointment, space's Londo Bell proves to be as agile as the
Gundoll Team was on the surface, arriving on Turn 2. Bright already knows the
Dangaioh Team is an ally - Roll, Pai, Mia and Ranba just came from the Earth
surface, where they battled by the Gundoll's side for a while.

   The wide debris field between you and the Bangars make approaching them a
boring task, and the surprise Gil mentioned arrives on Turn 3 - the Sky Tanks
from the lower left side aren't so tough, but the Aizams by the right should
demand attention, especially because of Shazara's presence.

   When Planet Lilis was invaded by the Bangar Space Pirates, princess Ranba
Nom was sent to space while her parents, escorted by the aide Shazara, stayed
to fight. However, despite their promises of resistance to the very end, the
monarchy soon surrendered, subjecting the people to Bangar's cruelty. Shazara
blames the royal family's weakness for the suffering of the survivors, going
as far as joining the pirates to obtain vengeance.

   When Shazara's HP is below 30%, you can have Dangaioh speak to her. Ranba
argues maybe her parents didn't surrender out of fear, but to save the people
from complete extinction. Regardless of that, if Shazara must accomplish her
vengeance to clear her mind and recognize the real enemy, Ranba is willing to
die by her hands - but not before defeating Bangar. These words have Shazara
recognize the royal family's strenght in Ranba and rejoin her princess.

   If, instead of speaking, you have Dangaioh defeat Shazara, Ranba says she
can't let herself be killed at this point - she must fight Bangar in the name
of her fallen Lilis subjects. Shazara calls the princess's words a joke - an
insult to the people's resentment. Having nothing else to say, Ranba takes to
herself the duty of helping Shazara out of her misery - the powerful 'Spiral
Knuckle' attack she uses against her aide becomes available from now on.



Scenario 12 (Space - Planet Dirad) - "Wandering Seeds"
------------------------------------------------------
32x24, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 13 (Dancouga, Ral Kairam + 11)

Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Turn 4, Player Phase - Londo Bell sortie


   Though Sara Yuuki, Masato Shikibu and Ryou Shiba can't help wondering how
could an asteroid leave its belt and end in a place that has no gravitational
forces capable of pulling it, Shinobu Fujiwara prefers not to mind the weird
thing until all nearby Guyzock units are taken care of.

   Dancouga'll be alone for much of this scenario, so you must make good use
of it: jump into the fight, using seishins to heal if necessary. Each Gabitan
falls with two or three hits and won't hurt you much, so Dancouga can handle
it - the Tracids, however, should be avoided at least until Shinobu gathers a
fair amount of kiryoku.

   On Turn 3, Masato realizes the Londo Bell still hasn't found them because
Dancouga's distress signal is being obstructed - and the jamming isn't coming
from the Guyzock mechs, but from inside the asteroid. Immediately after this
discovery, new enemies creep into the battlefield - things that don't show up
on the metal, heat or lifeform detectors.

   The Londo Bell arrives right after, making the rest pretty easy. Heal and
reload Dancouga, then go nuts on the enemies. By now, most MechaBoosts should
be very weak, and the Dirad Battle Mechas aren't so tough - they have fairly
high HP and reasonable firepower but, in the end, their most annoying feature
is the HP healing skill (10% per turn).

Events: Nine or less enemies - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        (Dangel's) Branbull's HP below 30% - Dangel leaves


   Your early visit is everything the current Gate of Zedan attackers wanted
to avoid - now they must make sure nobody survives to tell. Being attacked by
what seems to be yet another new invading alien faction only adds up to your
crew's confusion, but Execellen fears it still can get worse: something tells
her the mysterious army's coming...

   Your weaker units can handle the Garms, but must do so quickly to prevent
them from blocking your other pilots' advance to the right. The Demons aren't
much harder, but the Branbulls are (Dangel's one has 18400 HP, the other two
have 18200). And then...

   Once you beat half the enemies, the mysterious army pops up again (by the
top-left and top-center sections of the base), just like Execellen predicted.
The enemy commander Dangel soon recognizes these as allies rounded up by his
comrades, but only tolerates their presence as a necessary evil.

   You've already met the Einstglieds and Knochens, but the Einstgemueds are
all new, and demand care (7200 HP, 30% HP healing and pretty strong attacks);
with the Demons and Branbulls you (probably) haven't defeated yet, they make
up for one difficult battle.

   Being defeated by you has Dangel think your team are "the earthlings that
gave Garuda so much trouble". Given that you don't even know this Garuda guy,
much less battled him, there's a chance there may be yet another new faction
in motion here, but that's something you'll have to worry about later...

   There should be no reason for anyone to want to attack the Gate of Zedan,
since it lost its importance after the armament curtailment program. It could
be because of its value as a military position, but none of the enemies ever
seemed to care about these - except for the Vega Alliance's raid on Luna Two,
all invaders went straight to the Earth itself. Then again, if these are new
enemies, why can't they have different objectives?

   Furthermore, it felt like the "bone-like enemies" had been hiding in here
since before you came, and yet didn't seem to be friends to the other enemies
- but the enemies didn't attack each other either?...

Events: Nine or less enemies - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        (Dangel's) Branbull's HP below 30% - Dangel leaves


   The Gate of Zedan seems deserted, but Bright deploys his units to confirm
nobody's hidden inside. Sure enough, lots of baddies soon rise - Dangel never
liked hiding from his enemies anyway. Being attacked by what seems to be yet
another new invading alien army only adds up to your confusion, but Execellen
fears it can get worse: something tells her the mysterious army's coming...

   Send the bulk of your forces to the right side of the base, as each Garms
group can be beaten by your weaker robots. The Demons aren't much harder, but
the Branbulls are (Dangel's one has 18400 HP, the other two have 18200). And
then...

   Once you beat half the enemies, the mysterious army pops up again (by the
left entrance of the base, and also above and below the Branbulls), just like
Execellen predicted. Dangel quickly recognizes these as allies rounded up by
a fellow commander, but only tolerates their presence as a necessary evil.

   You've already met the Einstglieds and Knochens, but the Einstgemueds are
all new, and demand care (7200 HP, 30% HP healing and pretty strong attacks);

Scenario 14 (Above an Abandoned Colony) - "Two Projects"

Player Units: 14 (Ral Kairam + 13)
Initial Enemy Formation: Rafflesia [Carozzo] Lv??
                         Denan-Zon Lv16 x05

                              Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive (optional)


   Carozzo knows the Londo Bell is probably the only thing in the Union Army
worth worrying about. He was also told it was currently underpowered, but the
presence of well-known super robots from previous wars says otherwise... Not
confident his 'Rafflesia' is ready for an actual battle, he decides to leave.
His subordinates are ordered to engage the Londo Bell, relying on the coming
reinforcements from the 'Black Corps'.

   These enemies are probably some of the hardest you've fought so far, with
strong long-range weapons and good aiming. But their armor isn't so great, so
they don't take that much to defeat.

   The forementioned enemy reinforcements come on Turn 3, including some odd
"Zaku-headed" mobile armors - the enemy leader Zabine doesn't understand what
Carozzo expects to get from a project even the old Zeons discarded, but will
use this battle as a test for their abilities.

   Each Apsalus has 10000 HP and strong beam cannons, including a MAP weapon
that will be used if you line up two or more units in front of them. Zabine's
Berga-Giros (10900 HP) is, mostly because of its skilled pilot, the toughest
enemy you'll face here.

   [NOTE: if you play this stage as third or fourth, Zabine'll have received
new orders that demanded him to go to Earth; consequently, he doesn't show up
here (nor do the Apsaluses) and is replaced by a weaker force.]

   After the battle, you conclude the huge mobile armor that left before the
battle began was there probably for maneuverability tests - given the current
situation on the Earth Sphere, they too may be starting their own operations
very soon... but why conduct tests at such a visible location?

   A lot has changed since Bright last talked to Hadzuki: first, the Elshank
turns out to be friendly, its crew joined the Gundoll Team just after landing
on the Earth surface - Hadzuki lied to protect the aliens from Hazard Pasha,
accused of joining the Zaboom Army's Earth conquest campaign.

   Second, the Meganoids have reappeared - Banjou Haran had defeated them by
the end of the previous war, but failed to completely terminate their leaders
Don and Korosu. A connection between Hazard Pasha's Mars Colony Base and the
Mars-based Meganoids isn't confirmed or discarded, but there's little Hadzuki
can do about it: right now, the Gundoll's preparing to invade Jaburo.

   Bright isn't worried about the Elshank, as he believes the newly-returned
Amuro and Kamille can handle any problems it may bring - the real reasons for
concern are, in his opinion, the Meganoid issue and the re(dis)appearance of
the 'Gundam Prototype 2' (GP-02A), the Gundam Project's second machine.

                                    ****

   Reporting about how the alien offensive seems to have paralyzed the Earth
Union, Mashymre urges Haman to take advantage of this opportunity, especially
because the aliens don't care to distinguish newtypes from oldtypes, and are
making moves against the spacenoids too.

   Also, accomplishing the late Aguille Delaz's last wish, the 'Delaz Fleet'
has put its 'Operation Stardust' in motion - Cima Garahau's armada is already
going to "that area", where it's expected to meet with "him".

                                    ****

   Neo Zeon seems to have finally started moving, as a large number of units
is detected heading towards Konpei Island (formerly known as Solomon). If you
consider Jaburo's been invaded by some unknown force, and that Luna Two, Von
Braun and the Gate of Zedan were already aimed at, Konpei Island is a logical
next step - all enemies are indeed pushing against military positions.

   As both Guyzock and the Vega Alliance Army have quieted down lately, this
could be a nice opportunity to dispose of at least one major enemy. If you do
manage to defeat the Zeons and the Gundoll Team conquers Jaburo back, things
will start looking much better for Earth.

                                    ****

   It would be understandable for the Neo Zeon mobile armors to want to stay
in the open, but even their mobile suits are keeping a distance from Solomon,
despite the benefits the terrain advantage would bring. This is obviously an
attempt to lure you closer, but retreating isn't a choice either, so...

   The enemies won't move at all at first, so you'll have to cover the whole
distance. Send a few units to the top corners of the map to fight the enemies
that'll show up there, but the best robots should move down. No matter what,
go through Solomon quickly, and don't leave anyone just standing there.

   Informed about how Earth robots would cluster in this location, Commander
Gorman attacks on Turn 2, his troops coming from all four corners of the map.
Though he's supposed to treat all earthlings as enemies, Gorman's especially
interested in the Earth-saving alien Duke, and therefore is willing to ignore
the "colony army" for now - in other words, the enemies are all yours.

   You just need a quick look on the enemy lineup to notice this won't be an
easy battle: each Big-Zam has 20000 HP (and is I-Fielded), the Val-Walos have
12200 HP each and Gorman has 15400, not to mention Cima and the other mobile
suits loaded with powerful attacks.

   On Turn 4 Anavel Gato, the "Nightmare of Solomon", shows up to accomplish
the Zeons' true objective - not to reconquer Solomon, but to use the GP-02A's
Mk.82 thermonuclear warhead to render the base useless and deprive the Union
Army from a major resupply station. Anyone hit by the nuke will certainly get
killed, and Gato (20400 HP) still joins the battle afterwards.

   [NOTE: if you defeated Gato on Episode 1 (Scenario 14) he doesn't show up
here; Cima leaves upon realizing something went wrong.]

   Another Gundam, as large as the GP-02A, enters one turn later: it's Judau
Ashta's ZZ-Gundam, finally reassembled and fully adjusted - unfortunately, by
now, all it can do is help you prevent the Zeons from damaging Konpei Island
even more.



Scene 4: "Operation Stardust"

   Weak energy readings are coming from that asteroid the Beast Battle Squad
discovered at the PLS Black Point; because that thing was suspicious from the
begining, your crew imagines that's your next destination, but Bright's been
informed of several other "odd activities".

   First, at a colony depopulated by one of the first Vega attacks and at an
adrift colony whose recovery had been interrupted because of the war. Then, a
third colony disappeared during its transport - even on war times people try
to recover colonies...

                                    ****

   While working on his mobile suit, Kou can't help noticing how your Gundam
roster has grown: Zeta and Double Zeta, a couple of Mark-II's, not to mention
the Gundam Project... Speaking of which, Nina wouldn't let Judau see more of
the Gundam Prototype 3 progress, claiming it's top secret; he wild guesses it
could be an "G-Defensor"-style add-on, but the Stamen's docking system isn't
meant to strap something on its back...

                                    ****

   Hazard says that, in order to be allowed to use again a certain 'device',
Ilbora must conduct a reconaissance mission into an abandoned colony - a site
that, according to Hazard, sheltered an Earth force sent from the same place
Ilbora's targets landed at.

   Ilbora fails to understand why he should investigate a site that Hazard's
unmanned mechs already confirmed to have hid enemies, but needs the device to
carry on his new brilliant plan, so he can't refuse.

                                    ****

   A mysterious army (not the bone-like guys, but apparently an alien force)
is attacking Luna Two. As you may remember, that's the place you started your
campaign at, and you already scavenged it for all weapons and robots it had.
However, even if it currently isn't much more than an empty shell, you cannot
afford to let it fall - you're running out of military positions, and losing
another one will definitely affect your performance from now on.

   On the Earth, the Gundoll Team has abandoned its plan of invading Jaburo.
Hadzuki's reasons are still unknown, as Bright was unable to contact him. The
last reports received indicate the Gundoll was rushing back to Japan - maybe
the super robot research institutes are being attacked.

   Knowing there isn't anything to do for them right now, you can only trust
the Gundoll Team's judgment and mind your own problems. Speaking of problems,
an urgent message comes from Nina: the Vegas are attacking Von Braun!



Scenario 16 (Von Braun) - "Burning Moon City"

32x40, Moon
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 14 (Grendizer, Ral Kairam + 12)

        Saucer Beast Jira-Jira's HP below 50% - Jigura leaves


   Unlike the other invaders, the Vega Alliance Army always seemed to target
more the Moon than the Earth. Maybe it's because of its importance - the Moon
houses Anaheim Electronics, Von Braun and several mining installations.

   The Vega beasts aren't difficult, but are joined by Neo Zeons on Turn 3 -
Mashymre expects the confusion to help him defeat the Londo Bell. Judau tries
to convince him this is no time for humans to fight each other, but Mashymre
won't give up following Haman's orders.

   The Qubeleys' funnels are troublesome, but not as much as Mashymre, Illia
and Jigura - they don't have high HPs, but are very skillful (super robots'll
probably need seishins to have a decent hit rate against them) and use their
shields a lot. At least Mashymre runs away when his HP drops below 40% - when
that happens, he says they consider the Earth Union rule the biggest evil: a
planet under it, he says, may as well be given to the aliens.

   After the battle, Duke wonders why was the King Vega personal guard here,
as their presence suggests the aliens considered this raid very important for
their campaign. Quattro, on the other hand, is worried about the Neo Zeons -
their assault seemed a bit too easy-going, he says.

        Zaku-III's HP below 40% - Mashymre leaves
        Saucer Beast Jira-Jira's HP below 50% - Jigura leaves


   What's hard to understand about the Vega Alliance Army is that it, unlike
all other space invaders, always seemed to mind the Moon more than the Earth.
Von Braun's already fallen by the time you arrive, but there's still time to
reconquer the city before it suffers major damages.

   The Vega beasts may take a while to reach, but aren't difficult. The real
problem are the Neo Zeons that show up all over the bottom left corner of the
map on Turn 3 - Mashymre expects the Londo Bell will be more easily defeated
if attacked during a battle against someone else. Judau tries to convince him
this is no time for humans to fight each other, but Mashymre won't budge.

   The Qubeleys' funnels are troublesome, but not as much as Mashymre, Illia
and Jigura - they don't have high HPs, but are very skillful (super robots'll
probably need seishins to have a decent hit rate against them) and use their

Scenario 17 (Desert Colony) - "The Never-learning Collector"

        Turn 12, Player Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (3) arrive (optional)
        Mega-Borg Bemmel's HP below 30% - Bemmel leaves


   Finding yet another slew of unidentified mechs inside the deserted colony
(and being attacked by them) isn't even surprising anymore. Anyway, send most
of your units upwards, as most enemies are likely to move to meet you there.

   The noises from the battle warn the enemy commander about your presence -
the sight of a human-resembling giant robot denounces your enemies' identity:
the Meganoids - or, more specifically, the mecha enthusiast Meganoid Bemmel.
Instantly falling in love with your beautiful robots, he decides to have them
added to his "collection".

   Bemmel has 21000 HP, but you only need to take 30% out for him to realize
you're unwilling to join his collection. And, because nobody understands what</pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
the hell is that "collection" he brags so much about, he decides to show you
some of it: Zaboom robots, Guyzock MechaBoosts and Titans mobile suits.

   Bemmel runs away when his HP drops below 6300, but keep in mind you DON'T
want him to leave; instead, destroy all other enemies while keeping him alive
until Turn 12, when he'll get angry and call in one of his collection's most
valuable items: the Zeong - Zeon's One Year War ultimate mobile suit.

   The Zeong has 14000 HP and very strong weaponry, but you had all the time
you needed to heal and reload your own units, so unleash hell on it. However,
make sure Quattro's the one that finishes it - if he does, the Zeong will be
yours by the end of this stage! After the Zeong shows up, you can also finish
Bemmel.



Scenario 18 (Near Planet Dirad) - "Dirad, Awaken"

Events: Eleven or less enemies - Enemy Reinforcements (1) arrive
        Next Turn - Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive
                    Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill, Triple Jim (Heli) appear
        Devil Saturn 6's HP below 50% - No.1 leaves
                                        Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill,
                                        Triple Jim (Heli) leave


   This area changed a lot since you picked up the Beast Batttle Squad here,
not that long ago: it seems to be attracting colony wreckages and meteorites,
and the asteroid looks bigger than before - and launches a welcome committee
before you get to decide what to do about it.

   The Dirad Battle Mechas wouldn't be so hard if they didn't recover 10% of
their life every turn, forcing you to focus your attacks at one opponent at a
time. To top it all, Gyandra strikes (from both sides of the field) once you
destroy four enemies. When questioned why aren't the Bangars attacking along,
Devil Saturn No.1 says they're not allied - escorting Gil into the Earth was
just an order he received.

   To finish the Londo Bell sooner, Abel launches out himself the next turn.
Upon seeing him, No.1 says you're as good as dead, but the Beast Battle Squad
refuses to give up; for a moment, Sara hears a voice calling her from inside
the asteroid, but quickly dismisses it to further encourage her teammates. As
bad as things are, at least Rom and his friends show up again to drive Devil
Saturn desperate. For once, they appear near the battle, so you can have them
jump in immediately.

   So you've got lots of tough enemies around: Abel's 'Dirad Decision Mecha'
has 17600 HP (and worse, 30% HP recover); each Mizuchi has 11600 HP and Devil
Saturn's got 12800 points. The good part is that the Vi-Kung-Fu is perfectly
capable of single-handedly beating Devil Saturn and the Mizuchis - just leave
Devil Saturn for last, because Rom goes chase him when he runs away.

   Rom would take a while to reach the Dirad Decision Mecha, so leave it for
your other units - it doesn't take that much firepower to destroy it, as long
as you do your attacks on a single turn to prevent him from healing.

   Bright feels safe to say the asteroid isn't an enemy base, as the sensors
show nothing but plants inside it. Quattro theorizes the things that attacked
you were just a defense mechanism, like bees protecting their hive - in this
case, you'd better just leave it alone. Bright agrees, and adds nobody should
mention this to Hadzuki - the Gundoll Team has its own problems, and there's
no reason to give them more concerns.



Scenario 19 (Luna Two) - "The Empress, Raiding"
-----------------------------------------------
32x40, Space
Goal: Protect Luna Two
Player Units: 14 (Ral Kairam + 13)
Initial Enemy Formation: Branbull [Warchimedes] Lv23

              If Last: Repair Kit S (after scenario end)
                       Psycho Frame (after scene end)
Events: Eleven or less enemies - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Branbull's HP below 40% - Warchimedes leaves
        (Cima's) Gerbera Tetra's HP below 50% - Cima leaves


   Thousands of years ago, Planet Campbell sent an expedition to establish a
colony on the Earth, but it was defeated (then and now). Calling that failure
a disgrace for all Campbells, Empress Janera is most determined to succeed -
especially when the Earth seems so messed up. Better for Warchimedes, given a
chance to conquer a human fortress and prove himself superior to Dangel.

   The Masprons have high HPs and armors, as well as 30% HP recover. If left
unchecked, they can reach Luna Two as soon as Turn 3; to avoid that, you must
rush to put at least a few units on their way (they won't move if a target's
already at range) to hold them back while your slower units don't arrive. You
must also have some units engage Warchimedes (19000 HP), but most enemies on
that part of the map are pretty weak.

   Once you defeat half the enemies, Cima shows up (by the upper left corner
of the field, very close to Luna Two), having run here as soon as she learned
someone else was attacking Luna Two. As you still can't let anyone touch the
base, you'll be in big trouble if you didn't send enough units that way. Cima
is, as usual, a really tough enemy, and the Val-Walos (12600 HP) can do some
heavy damage too.

   After the battle, Bright decides that, since you were forced to return to
Luna Two, you may as well take some time to resupply. If you chose this stage
as fourth of fifth, you'll be given a 'G-Defensor', a power-up unit meant to
be attached to the Gundam Mk-II - Burning's mobile suit will be upgraded into
the 'Super Gundam' before Scenario 21.

Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        (Ilbora's) Skeleton's HP below 30% - Ilbora leaves
        (Sharm's) Skeleton's HP below 50% - Sharm leaves


   Though Hazard insists AI-powered machines couldn't investigate the colony
properly, Ilbora soon concludes he was sent here only to fight the Londo Bell
patrol that would certainly follow. Oh well, he wouldn't like to return home
empty-handed anyway, and is curious to see whether the Londo Bell matches the
Gundoll Team that defeated him on Earth, so he stays to fight even though he
knows that's what Hazard wants him to do.

   Eager to return Zaboom the attack suffered inside this very space colony,
your Mazinger won't accept being left out of this battle. Of the enemies, the
Shermans are easy and can be used to build your pilots' ki before facing the
somewhat harder Banks robots.

   On Turn 3, the enemy reinforcements arrive (through the right side of the
field). They're led by Sharm, also known as "Benikage" (Crimson Shadow), sent
by Emperor Zaboom himself to boost a campaign he considers to be hindered by
Ilbora's personal grudges. Both Ilbora and Sharm are tough (by the way, their
Skeletons have 22800 and 22600 HP, respectively), but run away once you hurt
them a little.

   There's no way to figure out what Zaboom wanted from an abandoned colony,
but the sight of Meganoid units between the enemy reinforcements supports the
version that states Hazard Pasha is a traitor, as it would show a connection
(via the Mars Colony Base) between Zaboom and the Meganoids.



Scenario 21 (Von Braun) - "Return to Paradise"
----------------------------------------------

Clear Bonus - Always: Anti-Beam Coating, Chou Goukin New-Z, $20000
Events: Twelve enemies left - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Next Turn - Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill, Triple Jim (Heli) appear
        GP-02A Physalis's HP below 30% - Gato leaves


   The space colony that had disappeared during its transport was found - on
a crash course towards the Moon! All the enemies' recent fascination with the
Moon remains unexplained - even if they're trying to deprive you of military
positions (as Von Braun or Anaheim Electronics potentially are), they have no
reason to conduct such an operation against it.

   Changing the colony's trajectory should be simple: destroying its mirrors
would alter its revolution and break its orbit but, if everything else fails,
standing by at Von Braun will allow you to quickly launch out against it.

                                    ****

   Upon learning the Londo Bell ran to Von Braun (obviously to intercept the
colony), Cima has Gato start the next part of her plan, letting know she will
join him if time permits, and that she already has a little something set up
at Von Braun...

                                    ****

   All of a sudden, the colony breaks off the Moon's orbit. Roux celebrates,
but only until she finds out where the new course leads to: Earth! This whole
thing was staged only to drive you away from the Zeons' true goal...

                                    ****

   Urgently called back to the ship, Ranba complains about not being able to
do some shopping (as if stores were open during this crisis); the new turn of
events prevented you from even resupplying, leaving the crew only the normal
maintenance to do.

   If, still on Part 1, you upgraded all of Dancouga's stats and weapons (at
least one level each) before sending it to space, you will now learn that the
early effort prevented Dancouga from developing further mechanical problems.
This bought Ryou just enough time to restore the Beast Battle Squad machines'
ability to enter their 'aggressive beast' modes - in other words, Dancouga's
new attack, 'Aggressive Beast', will be available from now on.

                                    ****

   Bright doesn't know where the colony's supposed to crash, but suspects it
could be Jaburo - Haman's bound to be unhappy with the mysterious army's push
against it. Many pilots at the Gundoll Team wish to go to space to reinforce
you, but that'd be pointless: even if they could reach space instantly, there
is no guarantee they'd reach the conflict area in time.

   For a colony drop to be sucessful, the colony must be aligned just before
it enters its crash orbit. For that final adjustment, the Zeons probably left
the colony's pulse engines unharmed - if you gain direct access to them, you
can delay the colony's fall.

                                    ****

   Being so close to Anaheim Electronics, Bright wished he could visit it to
pick up new robots, but prefers to take off sooner than later, so you'll have
more time to destroy the enemy forces that are surely protecting the colony.
Sure enough, Gato attacks to hold you back for as long as possible. Since you
can't waste time here, Bright sets a ten-minute (ten-turn) deadline for this
battle to end.

   Most of the enemies are pretty difficult, but not impossible. Needless to
say, Gato's the toughest enemy - his Atomic Bazooka will be unlocked once you
kill five of his fellow Zeons, and he _will_ fire it as soon as at least two
of your units are at range. So, you obviously should take care of him as soon
as possible... but not before doing the following:

   First, have Kou fight Gato; when asked, Gato tells he stole the GP-02A to
force people to have ideas and ideals, because nothing ever changes when only
pilots fight - for example, on the Earth Union, only the Londo Bell is doing
anything. Kou should know better than being used by people that depend solely
on the power of others to protect their own land, he says.

   After this speech, have Quattro talk to Gato. He'll argue everything Zeon
pursued, all its ideals, were lost when the Zabi family assassinated Zeon Zum
Daikun; the Zabis too do nothing but use the Zeon name, and now Haman Karn's
doing the same. Gato's shaken, but isn't moved from his plans of avenging the
many great men that died crushed by the Union. (Now that everything that had
to be said was said, fight Gato normally; he has 21000 HP.)

   Once you kill half the enemies, their reinforcements show up - Kelley can
only thank Cima for such a well-designed plan: hiding for so long at the city
feels worth it, now that the Londo Bell is pincered between two forces.

   The next turn, as Cima gloats you're so outnumbered you may not even live
to see the colony drop, the Machine Robo Team shows up to remind her nobody's
invincible. Blue Jet says they, unlike what you may think, don't really like
meddling at other worlds' businesses, but this colony drop may have Gyandra's
hand behind it - Zeon probably isn't allied to Gyandra, but is being somehow
influenced by it.

   Your own reinforcements should handle Cima, simply because they're closer
to her. Even the Gerbera-Tetra won't last long against Rom, but the Val-Walos
probably already moved to the right, and must be defeated by somebody else -
hopefully, you have at least one good super robot and a few good mobile suits
by that area. Kelley's Val-Walo has 12600 HP, the others have 12400.

   As soon as all enemies are defeated, Bright pulls all units back into the
ship immediately, so no time is wasted - only the absolute necessary supplies
are carried, repairs and maintenance are to be done on the road. The Machine
Robo Team must leave again to chase their enemies, but this time their leader
finally tells you his name: Rom Stohl, from Planet Cronos.

   If you've played Episode 1 and, back then, cleared Scenario 19-A1, you'll
now be sent to Scene 5-A; otherwise, go to Scene 5-B.



Scene 5-A: "Colony Pursuit" (main team route)
=============================================

 Choice:  Reef Airspace               ->  Scenario 22-A
 Choice:  Dark Airspace               ->  Scenario 23-A
 Choice:  Space - Metorite Area       ->  Scenario 24-A
 Last:    Above the 'Stardust' Colony ->  Scenario 25


   A powerful electromagnetic interference is preventing you from contacting
the Gundoll Team. Now you don't know whether you should expect reinforcements
or not - being unable to make it on time might not stop them from trying.

   When the Londo Bell's already plotting the shortest course to the colony,
Nina calls to let know the Gundam Prototype 3's expansion unit ('Orchis') is,
at last, completed. As the GP-03 was originally conceived to defend military
positions, it would certainly be useful in reconquering the rogue colony, but
you simply don't have enough time to go pick it... It'll have to wait.

                                    ****

   Dr. Tarsan criticizes the Dangaioh Team's decision to stay and defend the
Earth, saying they haven't yet understood how terrible the space pirates are.
When the Bangars bring in their full power, everything will be lost, he says
- especially now that they've allied to the Gyandra space criminals...

   When the Dangaioh Team tells about the people that have been helping them
from time to time, Tarsan comments he has heard of Planet Cronos before: it's
a planet Gyandra had to withdraw from, not long ago. He doesn't know any Rom
Stohl, but Kirai Stohl is the founder of the 'Tenkuu-Chuushin-Ken', a martial
arts style said to be the most powerful of all universe. It's said Kirai was
killed during the fight against Gyandra... maybe Rom is his relative.

   In the end, it's not so strange to see a Tenkuu-Chuushin-Ken master here,
given this world seems to be gathering people from everywhere. Tarsan guesses
it's because the Earth, for reasons still unknown, emits some kind of energy
or force field. Thanks to whatever that is, Earth is the only planet that can
be located from anywhere in the universe. For wandering factions like Bangar
or Gyandra, such a great reference point is extremely valuable.

   Tarsan isn't interested about studying the Earth's mysteries; he'd rather
get out of here fast, before the space pirates find and catch him. But, since
the Dangaioh Team won't go anywhere anytime soon, he'll give a little advice
- they should be careful about the PLS Black Point asteroid, as its energy is
still rising.

                                    ****

   As mentioned before, any reinforcements from Earth would never make it to
space in time to join any effort to prevent the colony drop... except Hadzuki
launched out a battleship (carrying super robots Raideen and Daitarn 3) and,
against all odds, it reached space with time to spare. Unfortunately, all the
saved time was lost when they suffered an engine failure that forced them to
ask for help. They're currently near the Moon, dragged by the gravity from an
abandoned colony cluster.

   Your friends can't just be abandoned at their own fortune, but turning to
rescue them would cost you a time you don't have. So, Bright decides to split
the Londo Bell in two - this way, a group can go bring in the reinforcements
(and maybe even get the GP-03's add-ons at Anaheim Electronics, if everything
goes out smoothly) without hurting the Ral Kairam's advance.

   The crew first thinks of asking Dr. Tarsan to investigate his own finding
about the PLS Black Point, but he's too afraid of the Bangar Space Pirates to
come anywhere near the Earth - right now, he's not even at the solar system.
As any short course towards the colony cluster necessarily go through the PLS
Black Point, the rescue party can drive by and take a look at it.

   Execellen (and consequently you) will stay with Bright at the Ral Kairam,
as do Emma, Quattro, Maria, Burning, the entire Mazinger Team, Zanbot 3 Team,
Roux and Shazara (if you have her, of course). [NOTE: Because Scenario 25 is
common to both Scenes 5-A and 5-B, it's written at the end of 5-B.]



Scenario 22-A (Reef Airspace) - "Butcher's Real Intention"
----------------------------------------------------------
32x40, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 12 (Ral Kairam + 11)
Initial Enemy Formation: Bandock [Butcher] Lv27
                         MechaBoost Tracid Lv22 x03

              If Last: Mega Booster (after scenario end)
                       Propellant Tank S (after scene end)
Events: Bandock's HP below 30% - Butcher leaves


   Crossing areas with such a high Minovsky particle concentration is always
risky, but you can't afford to take a long route around it - at least it also
increases your chances of not being detected by Zeon patrols. Unfortunately,
you bump into Killer the Butcher as he was heading towards the Earth to enjoy
the disaster the Zeons are cooking.

   Butcher's Bandock has 26200 HP; when left with 7860 points (30%) or less,
Butcher grows worried with the damage suffered. As Kappei and Uchuuta seem to
have no intention of letting him escape, he announces you left him no choice
but to use his last resource... and runs away. Actually, Quattro says, that's
probably for the best - if he really had a wildcard, you'd be in big trouble
fighting it with your current forces.

   After all enemies are gone, Bright regrets the precious time lost and the
Zanbot Team complains Butcher managed to escape again, but your more positive
pilots find reasons to celebrate: Guyzock was heading towards the Earth, and
you'd find yourself pincered between them and the Zeons if you hadn't handled
them here.



Scenario 23-A (Dark Airspace) - "A Realm of Everlasting Darkness"
-----------------------------------------------------------------
32x24, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 11 (Raideen, Weissritter, Ral Kairam + 8)
Initial Enemy Formation: Einstknochen Lv25 x02
                         Einstglied Lv25 x02
                         Einstknochen Lv24 x04

Enemy Reinforcements (3): Einstgemued Lv25 x01
                          Einstgemued Lv24 x02
Clear Bonus - Always: Haro, Propellant Tank S
              If Last: Psycho Frame (after scenario end)
                       BioSensor (after scene end)
Events: Turn 2, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (1) arrive
        Turn 3, Player Phase - Londo Bell sortie
                               Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive (optional)
        Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (3) arrive


   Following Raideen's orientations, Akira ends up in the middle of nowhere.
A little upset with his now silent robot, he's about to return to the Elshank
when the mysterious enemies attack - they're probably the reason Raideen had
to come here.

   Raideen can stand a few hits, but not enough to face so many enemies (and
more come on Turn 2 already), so let them come your way and battle a few at a
time - especially since you may not have weapons to counter the Einstglieds.
The Londo Bell arrives at Turn 3; increasingly intrigued about these enemies,
Execellen launches out upon hearing their voice.

   If you already cleared Scenario 22-A, Butcher attacks the Londo Bell once
again - the previous defeat was the last straw, so much he decided to unleash
Guyzock's guardian deities Helldine and Deathguine. With or without Butcher,
three more of the mysterious enemies show up still on Turn 3 - though they're
few, remember Einstgemueds have beam coatings and 30% HP recover.

   After the fight, nobody understands what Akira means when he says he left
Banjou's party and came all the way here because "Raideen told him to". As he
remembers Kyousuke once claimed he could hear the mysterious enemies' voice,
Akira wonders whether there's a connection between him and Execellen - Bright
supposes it's 'that incident' that happened during the One Year War, but has
a colony drop to worry about at the moment.



Scenario 24-A (Space - Meteorite Area) - "A Flower Blooming in Space"
---------------------------------------------------------------------
32x24, Space
Goal: Protect your mothership
      Destroy all enemies within 7 turns
Player Units: 12 (Ral Kairam + 11)
Initial Enemy Formation: Rafflesia [Carozzo] Lv29
                         Denan-Gei Lv22 x02
                         Denan-Zon Lv22 x02

                         Denan-Zon Lv21 x07
Enemy Reinforcements: Vigna-Ghina [Zabine] Lv??
                      Denan-Gei Lv22 x04
                      Apsalus Lv21 x04
Clear Bonus - Always: Cartridge, Psycho Frame
              If Last: Chou Goukin New-Z (after scenario end)
                       Cartridge (after scene end)
Events: Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive
                              Carozzo leaves
        Turn 4, Player Phase - Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill,
                               Triple Jim (Heli) appear
                               Zabine, Apsalus (x2) leave


   Compared to the regular routes, the shortcuts the Londo Bell's taking are
way harder - this time, for example, they'll have to cross a meteorite field.
Worse, a meteorite field full of enemy ambushers: the colony drop serves the
Crossbone Vanguard's interests, as it seems they too plan to attack the Earth
(Carozzo comments striking the Earth with a large mass is the exact opposite
to his own intended tactics).

   To save as much time as possible, Bright sets a seven-minute (seven-turn)
deadline for this battle to end. Combined with the accidented 'terrain', this
means you must rush and engage as many enemies as soon as possible; at least
the asteroids help you evade the Vanguard units' good hit rate.

   The enemy reinforcements come on Turn 3. Carozzo then decides to take the
still imperfect Rafflesia away, leaving the Londo Bell's demise to Zabine and
his newly-brought Apsaluses - though it's obvious those 'Zaku-headed' mobile
armors are Zeonic technology, their connection with the Crossbone Vanguard is
still unclear.

   By the beginning of the next turn, your crew begins to fear they won't be
able to finish the battle in time, but the Machine Robo Team shows up to save
the day - even if this means they'll have to take a break from chasing Devil
Saturn. As the tide turns, Zabine runs away (taking two Apsaluses along); Rom
could go after him, but thinks it's more important to help you out of here.

   With the Machine Robo Team's help and most major enemies out, the rest of
the battle should be pretty easy, and the Ral Kairam'll be back on track soon
enough. When invited once again, Rom still hesitates about joining the Londo
Bell for good, but can't deny Gyandra's growing interference on Earth matters
makes it impossible for him not to interfere himself.



Scene 5-B: "Colony Pursuit" (rescue party route)
================================================

 Choice:  Anaheim Electronics         ->  Scenario 22-B
 Choice:  Abandoned Colony Cluster    ->  Scenario 23-B
 Choice:  Near Planet Dirad           ->  Scenario 24-B
 Last:    Above the 'Stardust' Colony ->  Scenario 25


   A powerful electromagnetic interference is preventing you from contacting
the Gundoll Team. Now you don't know whether you should expect reinforcements
or not - being unable to make it on time might not stop them from trying. So
far, all Bright heard about the events on the Earth surface is that the Beast
Battle Squad Base was attacked by the Darkness Great General and the Mikeene
Empire, and was probably rendered useless...

   When the Londo Bell's already plotting the shortest course to the colony,
Nina calls to let know the Gundam Prototype 3's expansion unit ('Orchis') is,
at last, completed. As the GP-03 was originally conceived to defend military
positions, it would certainly be useful in reconquering the rogue colony, but
you simply don't have enough time to go pick it... It'll have to wait.

ask for help. They're currently near the Moon, dragged by the gravity from an
abandoned colony cluster.

   Your friends can't just be abandoned at their own fortune, but turning to
rescue them would cost you a time you don't have. So, Bright decides to split
the Londo Bell in two - this way, a group can go bring in the reinforcements
(and maybe even get the GP-03's add-ons at Anaheim Electronics, if everything
goes out smoothly) without hurting the Ral Kairam's advance.

   The crew first thinks of asking Dr. Tarsan to investigate his own finding
about the PLS Black Point, but he's too afraid of the Bangar Space Pirates to
come anywhere near the Earth - right now, he's not even at the solar system.
As any short course towards the colony cluster necessarily go through the PLS
Black Point, the rescue party can drive by and take a look at it.

   The loss of the Beast Battle Squad's base has Execellen decide to go with
the rescue party, thinking she can help the reinforcements arrive in time and
prevent Jaburo from falling too. She's joined by Kou (on the GP-03S Stamen),
Elle (Methuss), Judau, Duke, the Beast Battle Squad and Dangaioh Team.

              If Last: Large Generator (after scenario end)

Events: Turn 4, Player Phase - Kuroshishi, Bakuryuu, Hourai-Ou appear
                               Enemy Reinforcements arrive
        Turn 5, Player Phase - GP-03 Dendrobium appears
        Zaku-III's HP below 20% - Mashymre leaves


   [NOTE: if, on Episode 1, you cleared Scenario 23 as first or second, this
stage probably changes (and probably by a lot, with Jou, Mike and Reny either
showing up sooner or being there already from the beginning). Unfortunately,
I myself haven't played this stage under these conditions and therefore can't
tell you how it'd be. Sorry :(]

   While Kou's inside Anaheim Electronics to pick up the Gundam Prototype 3,
Neo Zeon attacks - to ensure Operation Stardust's success, Haman Karn ordered
Mashymre to investigate any suspicious enemy activity. Quickly understanding
the Londo Bell sent a party to pick up some sort of new weapon, he orders his
men to invade Anaheim and destroy whatever it's assembling.

   The enemies wouldn't be so hard if you didn't have to keep an eye on your
units' energy and ammo - notice you can only reload ammo by using seishins or
cartridges, and even energy-refilling spots are few and far apart.

   On Turn 4, following a major power surge, a bright light flashes and, all
of a sudden, an entire city appears right next to Anaheim Electronics! Though
nobody understands what's happening, Mia comments the bright light resembled
Dr. Tarsan's 'warp beam'... Indeed, you just witnessed the work of a teleport
device Ilbora borrowed from the Meganoids to drag the Gundoll Team away from
home - unfortunately for him, he couldn't capture more than just the Tobikage
Team.

   To top it all, the damn machine, because of a defect of something, failed
to beam its cargo to Mars, taking them 'only' as far as the Moon surface. The
Tobikage Team's appearance makes things much easier - the only difficult new
opponent is Ilbora's Skeleton (23000 HP).

   Kou only shows up on Turn 5, bringing in the completed Gundam Prototype 3
('Dendrobium'). The GP-03 is loaded with powerful weapons, but it should take
a couple turns to reach the battle, so maybe it won't be that useful here.

   After the battle, the party moves on to its next destination, as there is
no time to waste. Jou, Mike and Reny are coming along too - though they can't
help worrying about the situation of the Earth, there isn't much they can do
about it now.



Scenario 23-B (Abandoned Colony Cluster) - "Run Ablaze, Warrior Brothers"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Daitarn 3 + all available units)
Initial Enemy Formation: Devil Saturn 6 [No.1] Lv27

              If Last: Psycho Frame (after scenario end)
                       Propellant Tank S (after scene end)
Events: Turn 3, Player Phase - Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill,
                               Triple Jim (Heli) appear
        Devil Saturn 6's HP below 30% - No.1, Kina leave
                                        Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill,
                                        Triple Jim (Heli) leave
        Turn 5, Player Phase - Londo Bell sortie
                               No.1, Kina leave
                               Kenryuu, Blue Jet, Rod Drill,
                               Triple Jim (Heli) leave


   Because Professor Umon's repairs were flawed and his refinement processes
couldn't deliver a very purified Killhacium fuel, the Elshank battleship only
came so far before failing again. Princess Romina can't apologize enough for
not making it to the meeting spot, but Banjou says it's just a minor hiccup -
with a rescue signal already up, the Londo Bell's detached party should soon
pick them up. Unfortunately, the enemies find them first...

   Gyandra's efforts to ensure the colony crash's success seem contradictory
for an army that wants to invade the Earth, suggesting their goal isn't Earth
itself, but something in it. Upon hearing that conclusion, Devil Saturn No.1
immediately attacks to prevent that information from spreading.

   So it's just Banjou against the world (don't expect Romina to do anything
against anybody, she doesn't aim well); Daitarn 3 can hold on well - but it's
likely to have trouble hitting those smaller enemies. The enemy numbers soon
weigh on, and having the Elshank dead in space doesn't help... by now, Banjou
only hopes for the Londo Bell or Tobikage to save the day.

   Despite Banjou's warnings about high numbers not being equal to strenght,
Devil Saturn's confident his larger forces will crush you, and wants Kina and
Koron to join the fight to put even more pressure on the newbies... but they
refuse: they only care about defeating Rom Stohl. Plus, defeating an enemy by
using only numerical superiority seems just... uninteresting.

   To make things worse for Devil Saturn, Rom Stohl appears on Turn 3 (as he
usually does in situations like this). You can have Rom talk to Kina to learn
she and Koron are the children of the 'Buffalo Warrior Jingi', a member of a
rival martial arts school killed by Rom in a honored duel.

   The Londo Bell's rescue party arrives only on Turn 5, forcing No.1 to run
away, followed by Kina and Koron - and by Rom, who can afford to pursue Devil
Saturn now that Banjou is safe. Defeating the remaining enemies shouldn't be
hard (despite the Bloody I's 24600 HP and the Bloody II's 20600).

   Though the Elshank should be able to move around, it's not in good enough
shape to stand a battle, so it'll be used to bring more supplies from Anaheim
Electronics. If you had Elpeo Ple rescued during Episode 1, the team decides
Von Braun's facilities are best for her. In case you're wondering, Akira took
his super robot Raideen through a different route to confirm a suspicion; he
should be crossing the Ral Kairam's path soon.



Scenario 24-B (Near Planet Dirad) - "Evil Reincarnated"
-------------------------------------------------------
32x24, Space
Goal: Destroy all enemies
Player Units: 11 (all available units)

              If Last: High Efficiency Radar (after scenario end)

Events: Six or less enemies - Enemy Reinforcements (1) arrive
        Next Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive (optional)
        Shapiro Battle Mecha's HP below 30% - Shapiro leaves


   Always full of surprises, the PLS Black Point asteroid has moved a little
since your last visit... on a course that will eventually lead it towards the
Earth. Shinobu considers this motion a sign of hostility, but the party sees
no reason to take any action... even when the enemies do come out and attack,
the Dangaioh Team blames it on Shinobu's aggressive movements.

   Once you destroy two thirds of the enemies, their reinforcements join the
battle. Sara can't help noticing a blue robot with a trembling right shoulder
among them - Shapiro's robot.

   Military people like Kou know Shapiro Keats was a soldier who, during the
last war, betrayed the Earth and allied with the Muge Zorbados Empire... but,
by the time that empire was defeated, his death had been confirmed (and Sara
reaffirms "the person who finished him had no doubt of it"). Shinobu supposes
the enemy just found Shapiro's mech somewhere, and tries to ensure Sara he's
really dead...

   If you've chosen this stage as last, another Dirad Decision Mecha follows
the enemy reinforcements: Caim thinks the just-'awakened' Shapiro isn't ready
for battle yet and, as Shapiro refuses to back out, joins the battle himself
to protect him. With his 16200 HP, Shapiro's a dangerous opponent, but rushes
back into the asteroid once he's left with less than 30%. The Dirad Decision
Mechas have 17600 HP each, Caim's has 18000.

   After the battle, Sara's convinced the now moving asteroid is part of yet
another invasion force, and that Shapiro is guiding them into the Earth, just
like he did for Muge in the past. Once again, Shinobu argues they don't know
who was inside that robot, but Sara, being the person who killed Shapiro (and
having loved him before his betrayal), has no doubts.

   While the Dangaioh Team was busy, Gil Bag landed at the Earth. This time,
however, Dr. Tarsan thinks he's not trying to lure Mia into a trap again, but
looking for what the Bangars really want from this planet... the reason they
allied with the Gyandra space criminals in the first place.

   Gyandra just came from a failed campaign against Rom Stohl's home, Planet
Cronos - an invasion attempt with the sole purpose of obtaining 'Hylibead', a
mysterious force of which only one usage record remains: it was once used to
a feat as amazing as correcting a distortion on Planet Cronos' axis. Engaging
in a new campaign so soon after that defeat suggests Gyandra found something
just as valuable as Hylibead on the Earth - probably 'Mutron'.

   In order to prevent the invaders from gaining a power Dr. Tarsan imagines
to be as marvelous as Hylibead's, the Dangaioh Team is going immediately into
the Earth - ideally, they should go only after thwarting the Neo Zeon colony
drop but, between sending two super robots into space and losing the Tobikage
Team to Ilbora's trap, the Gundoll Team lost too many robots and could use a
little help.

   Jou, Mike and Reny too would like to return, but their robots, unlike the
Dangaioh flying mechs, probably aren't capable of atmospheric entries. That's
a problem Tarsan can solve as soon as he meets the Tobikage Team: he's got a
'warp beam' that can take them to wherever they want to go.

                                    ****

   Even after a quick stop to pick up Akira and his super robot Raideen, the
Londo Bell managed to reach the space colony in time. To make it even better,
the detached party successfully rescued Banjou Haran and his Daitarn 3 - and
still found time to get the Gundam Prototype 3's final 'Dendrobium' form.

   Rescued and sent to the Moon by the detached team, the Elshank's crew has
a transport vessel deliver extra supplies to the Londo Bell, including a Zeon
'Dooben-Wolf' mobile suit - probably captured during the attack on Von Braun
and restored by Anaheim.

   If, on Episode 1, you captured the Gundam and Char's Zaku parts, you also
receive a red Zaku. But not the one Char "Red Comet" Aznable piloted: this is
instead apparently a MS-06R-2, 'High Mobility Type' Zaku - an elusive model,
of which only four of five units were ever built. Turns out this isn't one of
those, just a replica made from the CharZaku parts the Gundoll Team captured
from the Meganoids. "That Nina sure likes upgrading..."

   If you had her rescued on Episode 1, the now recovered Elpeo Ple too came
in the transport vessel, all willing to join the Londo Bell and "beat all the
bad guys". If you didn't import a save game from Episode 1, you'll be joined
by super robot Combattler V (I haven't seen this myself, so I can't tell much
about it; those who played Episode 1 know Combattler V stayed at the Gundoll
all the time, so it doesn't make much sense to me).

                                    ****

   By the time you arrive, the colony is no more than twelve minutes (turns)
away from its "limit intervention point", the point after which its crash can
no longer be avoided. As expected, the Zeons have a number of advanced units
guarding the colony's path, including Gato in a mobile armor.

   The mysterious army attacks once you defeat half the Zeons, justifying an
uneasy feeling Execellen had earlier - that's a little unexpected, since none
of their previous raids suggested any interest in inflicting massive damages
to the Earth... In the end, you don't have time to worry about that, and it's
not like they're the only enemies whose goals you can't understand.

   On Turn 5 the Zeons' reinforcements enter - including Cima on the GP-02A.
A nuclear blast is everything you don't want to think about (especially given
you already spent half the turns you had to stop the colony drop), but don't
despair: the Machine Robo Team arrives on Turn 6, having already defeated the
Gyandra party that was coming to support the Zeons.

   Use seishins to raise Rom's kiryoku and unlock the Kenryuu's best attacks
so you can defeat Cima (21000 HP) before she gets to fire the Atomic Bazooka.
As with all enemies, Cima doesn't use MAP weapons until she has at least two
targets in range, so let only Rom close to her - this way, she won't fire the
nuke even if her kiryoku reaches 110.

   Since Gato's kiryoku raises two points whenever you defeat an enemy (and,
unlike Cima, he was here from the beginning), he'll probably be full of it by
the time you engage him, lowering the damage he'll suffer from your attacks;
if possible, cast Datsuryoku to lower him to a more acceptable level.

   The other enemies are no match for the Machine Robo units and should fall
quickly, clearing the road for Quattro and Kou to invade the colony and alter
its course. In the meantime, Rom asks for an audience with Bright to discuss
Gyandra's objectives...

   With her colony drop averted and the situation at the Earth calming down,
Haman Karn judges this is the right time for her next step: Mashymre Cello is
to lead a group of new mobile suits against the Londo Bell, while Glemy Toto
(already sent to Jaburo) destroys the Gundoll Team with help from some Titans
remnants...

   To Mashymre, the Titans' appearance is pretty surprising, but leaving the
greedy Glemy unchecked is just plain worrysome. Turns out Haman already knows
what to expect from him, and considers this assignment a nice opportunity to
see how he behaves.

                                    ****

   Execellen tells Akira that the only thing she and Kyousuke have in common
is an incident during their time in the officers school... a shuttle accident
from which only the two of them survived. But Reina walks in before she gets
to tell what caused the incident.

   Some of the Londo Bell members thought the Machine Robo Team members were</pre><pre id="faqspan-4">
covered in armor-shaped machines or something like that, but they're actually
mechanical lifeforms. If the Dangaioh Team hadn't left in such a hurry, they
could've told Bright what Rom's telling now about Gyandra and Mutron.

                                    ****

   Bright calls the Gundoll Team to tell about a Zeon landing on the Earth -
because these were deployed immediately after the last battle, the Londo Bell
couldn't intercept them. During this call, Hadzuki reveals the Dangaioh Team
told him about the 'plant planet', and complains Bright's secrecy compromises
his ability to plan countermeasures against eventual Earth invaders.

   Bright apologizes and transmits everything he has about the asteroid, but
keeps on withholding information: he just learned the plant planet is picking
up speed! As far as he knows, the only way to stop that thing is by shooting
it with far more firepower than all your units can provide: the Titans former
headquarters 'Gryps II' 'colony laser' should still be usable...

   Rom imagines the simultaneous Zeon and plant planet offensives are not by 
coincidence - with the colony crash averted but the situation still confused,
this would be a good time to deliver a fatal blow to the Union's forces. For
the same reason, the Bangars and Gyandras too may attack the Earth surface to
find Mutron.

   Maybe confirming that theory, enemy troops start gathering at the Gate of
Zedan and Konpei Island, while Von Braun reports having found a Vega Alliance
Army frontline base at the dark side of the Moon.

                              Gundam F91, Vigna-Ghina appear


   Your magnificent colony drop obstruction marked the Londo Bell as a great
threat to Carozzo's plan of "purging" the Earth - for him, your opposition is
just more of the irrational sentiment-driven, animal behavior that exhausted
the Earth Sphere so much.

   By Turn 3, you probably haven't engaged the Apsaluses (11000 HP) yet, but
an even bigger one enters anyway - the 'Apsalus III' shows the Zeons too know
mobile armors very well. [NOTE: if Ginius survived the battle on Episode 1's
Scenario 27, Zabine shows up too, reporting the Apsalus Project's manager was
taken into medical care.]

   Immediately after that, two other mobile suits scare you from behind, but
aren't your enemies, despite the fact Cecily rides a Crossbone Vanguard unit;
since Seabook's 'Gundam F91' is presumably related to the 'Formula Project',
Bright finds them trustworthy and asks them for help.

   Although high-leveled, Zabine (11700 HP) isn't that hard when compared to
the Perfect Apsalus and Rafflesia: more than massive HPs (34200 and 36400 HP,
respectively), it's their solid armors that make them really nasty - attacks
weaker than 2500 won't hurt them much, and it takes more than 3000 to inflict
serious damage.

   After the battle, Seabook confirms his Gundam was released by the Union's
Strategic Naval Research Institute (SNRI), and adds his own mother had a part
in its development; Cecily doesn't want to get involved with you and berates
him for telling more than you need to know, but he responds they have already
revealed themselves to the Londo Bell and can no longer fake indifference to
Earth's other problems.



Scenario 27 (Gate of Zedan) - "The Children Who Forgot Their Dreams"

                                Enemy Reinforcements (3) arrive (optional)


   At the One Year War's final battlefield, without time constraints for the
first time in a while, your crew expects a quick and easy victory against Neo
Zeon - Mashymre counts on that carelessness.

   On Turn 3, Mashymre unveils a little present Haman insisted him to bring:
Glemy's newtype army, entering from the bottom of the screen. If you have Ple
on your side, she and Ple-Two will feel really uncomfortable at each other's
presence, making Ple-Two eager to destroy you and stop the pain.

   If, on the other hand, you haven't got Ple, there will be no bad feelings
and Judau will be able to talk Ple-Two into changing sides (he has to talk to
her twice; I haven't seen this myself, so I don't know what what he argues).
With or without Ple-Two, the Qubeleys demand care: they're not resistant, but
their funnels are obviously dangerous.

   The mysterious enemy attacks, showing up around the Gate of Zedan itself,
once there are seven or less Zeons left. Tired, Execellen demands to know why
do they only speak to her - and, for once, they stay silent.

   On Episode 1's Scenario 28, if Glemy ran away before the battle, he shows
up now, gloating his early Earth departure had him arrive on time to stop the
Union's advance (though Mashymre calls this disobedience to Haman's orders a
betrayal, not a reinforcement). Because Glemy considers the alien invasions a
fair punishment to those who foolishly cling on to the Earth, the Zeons will
not attack the mysterious army.

   None of the enemies has too much HP, so focus on beating their top pilots
first, using super robots (and lots of seishins). Also notice most mysterious
army units can heal every turn: those who don't have HP recover are standing
on a base...

Clear Bonus - Always: Chou Goukin New-Z, Psycho Frame
              If Last: BioSensor (after scenario end)
Events: Turn 4, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements arrive


   Following a succession of worlds in that nebula, Planet Vega succumbed to
the Vegatron radiation contamination and exploded, leaving its people without
a place to call home. Therefore, the Vega Alliance Army can't afford to give
up its Earth conquest plans, even if it means hastening their final offensive
in response to the detection of their 'Skull Moon' frontline base.

   The initial enemies aren't much of a threat, as their low HPs render them
easy to kill - the exceptions are the Motherships (17800 HP) and the Gin-Gins
(15600 HP), but these specific units' have relatively weak close-range moves
that can be resisted.

   More foes arrive on Turn 4, approaching the base from the opposite side -
not only the previously known Gorman and Jigura, but also the Great King Vega
himself, ordering an all-out attack to leave no survivors and clear the road
to the conquest of the Earth.

   [NOTE: if you're playing this scenario as fourth or fifth, the king won't
be on the ship - he was ejected to a safe location. Gandal then takes control
of his battleship to defeat the earthlings.]

   Good super robots can beat Gorman (16200 HP) and Jigura (9700 HP) easily,
leaving only the massive 'King Of Vega' and its 39400 HP (39200 under Gandal)
- it's actually more tiresome than troublesome, partially because it takes a
while for you to get to that corner of the map.

        Turn 3, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (2) arrive
        Turn 4, Enemy Phase - Enemy Reinforcements (3) arrive


   Regardless of whether a creature is made of flesh and bone or mechanisms,
Rom can feel the 'rumbling' of a spirit on all living beings, which isn't the
case with the mysterious enemies - however, unlike other inorganic, lifeless
enemies he faced in the past, these clearly have a will of their own.

   On Turns 2, 3 and 4 more enemies enter, respectively by the bottom right,
middle right and top left sides of the map. As usual, the initial enemies had
spoken a (seemingly random) word to Execellen, but this time each subsequent
wave also speaks to her, leading her to think maybe all these words are to be
understood together. "Power/Not included in this power/Pursued"...?

   Despite all the enemy reinforcements, the fight should be easy. After it,
the crew wonders how could all those successive waves show up apparently from
nowhere, but conclude a base that suffered so many attacks should be falling
apart and have many holes through which the enemies could've entered.



Scenario 30 (Gryps II Vicinities) - "Hyperbolic Destruction"

   This scenario changes depending on when you play it. If you chose to play
it as first, second or third, you'll be sent to Scenario 30-1; if you want to
play it as fourth or fifth, go to 30-2 instead.

        Shapiro Battle Mecha's HP below 20% - Shapiro leaves


   The colony laser is, as the name implies, a space colony converted into a
massive laser cannon. Though it hasn't been used since the Titans' "Operation
Maelstrom", it was mantained by the Earth Union Army until recently, when it
was left neglected because of the armament reduction program and the war.

   The Londo Bell has about ten minutes to enter the colony and set it up to
shoot (after that, the asteroid will be out of the cannon's line of fire), so
Bright deploys some units to secure the premises. Unfortunately, Gryps II is
already surrounded by the units that usually guard the PLS Black Point... and
Muge Empire machines from the last war?

   Shinobu still wants to believe the enemies have just gathered Muge units,
but a transmission from them leaves no doubt about the identity of its pilot:
Shapiro Keats is really alive! Sara flips out for a second, but quickly puts
herself together and reaffirms her will to cut that traitor out of her life -
as many times as it takes.

   Like the Dirad Battle Mechas, the Zangaiohs have 10% HP recovery, meaning
you should concentrate your efforts into taking one enemy down at a time - by
now, at least you have several robots capable of delivering powerful support
attacks and make things a little easier.

   The enemy reinforcements appear (by the right side of the map) once there
are nine enemies left. Having so many people showing up at once suggests they
anticipated your move, perhaps because somebody tipped them - Shapiro again?
Anyway, with your ten-turn deadline running out, you have little choice other
than rushing to destroy them all.

   After the battle, Quattro and Emma enter Gryps II to adjust the cannon so
it'll automatically align itself with its target. Despite Shapiro and all the
troubles he brought along, Masato comments it was good to come here sooner -
given a little more time, the enemies could've booby-trapped the laser.

Anyway, with your ten-turn deadline running out, you have little choice other
than rushing to destroy them all.

   Once you defeat Abel (18400 HP), another enemy robot comes out, this time
from the colony. Finding out the enemy has beaten you to Gryps is bad enough,
but it gets worse when you receive a transmission that leaves no doubt about
the identity of that robot's pilot: Shapiro! Sara flips out for a second, but
quickly puts herself together and reaffirms her will to cut that traitor out
of her life - as many times as it takes.

   Shapiro isn't really difficult, so his appearance doesn't make the battle
last much longer. Once you're done, Quattro and Emma enter Gryps II to adjust
the cannon so it'll automatically align itself with its target - the two are
advised to be careful inside the colony, as Shapiro was inside it and had the
time to mess with it.



Scenario 31 (Earth Vicinities) - "Into the Quaking Cosmos"

        Galdy's HP below 30% - Galdy leaves


   Advised by Shapiro, Lady Diore and Caim agreed it was too soon to move on
to the next phase, but that wouldn't stop Abel from doing so anyway - he sees
no reason to listen to the advice of someone who "brought a polluted culture
into the great Dirad", a criminal they found adrift in space.

   And, as they approach the Earth itself, the Londo Bell Team Shapiro fears
so much will surely appear - and pay the highest price for their interference
against the invaders' plans.

                                    ****

   Quattro and Emma entered Gryps II only to find its laser emission systems
damaged. Emergency procedures were enabled, but left doubts about whether the
colony laser would be sufficient to destroy the asteroid. As the firing time
approaches, the plant planet is discovered to be moving faster than expected,
as if it had somehow picked up speed. The pilots protect their eyes and wait
for the laser to fire... but nothing happens.

   The disappointed pilots look for alternative destruction methods, but Rom
points out it may not be necessary at all: the asteroid's acceleration didn't
seem to be caused by any external forces, suggesting there might be a way to
"drive" that thing.

   As of now, the Union Army can't afford to fail in any front: if the Londo
Bell manages to stop the asteroid, its ability to keep on fighting afterwards
depends on the Gundoll Team's success in reconquering Jaburo. Unfortunately,
the asteroid is emitting powerful electromagnetic waves that prevent you from
contacting the surface.

                                    ****

   Knowing the Londo Bell's bound to show up and face the threat approaching
the Earth, Diondra must take the opportunity to defeat them and prove herself
worthy of being on Gyandra - Gades already warned her this organization "has
no place for the incompetent".

   Her younger brother and subordinate Devil Saturn has already made all the
arrangements for their sortie, and "that cow girl" too is prepared for battle
- as is someone else, very interested in defeating Rom Stohl...

                                    ****

   Execellen can't help feeling someone is watching her, and is disturbed to
the point of confronting this invisible presence. As everyone else gathers to
see what's going on, she says she was just talking to herself and goes stand
by the Weissritter - but that sensation continues there...

                                    ****

   You have no more than twenty minutes before the asteroid comes too close,
and there's no guarantee destroying its escorts will affect its motion in any
way. The Dirad Decision Mechas boast 18000 HP each and recover 30% per turn;
focus on one opponent at a time while saving as much SP as possible.

   With eight or less enemies left, the crew grows confident they'll be able
to beat all invaders in time, but many pilots (your most sensitive ones) then
start feeling something bad is about to happen... and the mysterious enemies
attack from the bottom of the map, including a new, huge unit. Execellen once
again hears them, but this time it causes a different, unconfortable feeling
on both her and Raideen...

   Gyandra attacks on Turn 5; among them is not only Diondra (Devil Saturn's
incompetence in defeating Rom forced her to intervene personally), but also a
new enemy, Galdy, who seems interested in Rom only as a potential challenge.
Kina and Koron too are there, but don't attack them.

   You should be able to defeat Mizuchi (12400 HP), Devil Saturn (13600 HP),
maybe Diondra (16200 HP) without seishins, but Galdy's 19400 HP will probably
demand some - and you still must save as much SP as you can. Notice that, if
the mysterious enemies haven't come yet, from now on they'll do so once there
are thirteen enemies or less.

   After Diondra leaves, Rom can speak to Kina and discover she's determined
to avenge her father's death because Diondra told her Jingi was murdered by a
cowardly sneak attack. However, Duke asks, can Kina see Rom go through great
lenghts only to stand by his friends' side and still think he'd be capable of
such a thing?

   Rom says the heavens will someday judge the tactics he used against their
father; until then, if Kina and Koron are so convinced of his guilt, they can
settle this dispute right now, but must be warned Rom won't restrain himself
- he can't afford to die at this moment. Kina accepts his words as those of a
true martial artist and changes sides, promising she'll see that the heavens
do someday judge his actions.

   The Einstregisseur has 46000 HP and is extremely high-leveled (so much it
can move twice per turn), meaning most of your units will require seishins to
even have a chance of hitting it. You better spend one turn positioning your
units around it, to only then unleash a barrage of high-powered attacks (this
is what you've been saving SP for) to destroy it within a single turn.

   After the Einstregisseur, any other enemies will seem easy in comparison.
Unfortunately, destroying them all doesn't stop the plant planet, leaving you
only the insane choice: to invade and destroy it from the inside.



Epilogue
========


   Emma fears you may not be able to stop the asteroid even from the inside,
but Ryou has high hopes: technically, the plant planet isn't an asteroid, but
a meteorite that grew large by gathering all sorts of debris. So, destroying
that meteorite core might be the key to stopping it.

   The plant planet's interference is now preventing you from contacting Von
Braun and Anaheim as well, meaning you won't get to tell anybody where you're
going to. Quattro imagines that, if the Gundoll Team survived, someone there
will figure out your destination, so there's no need to worry.

                                    ****

   While talking about Guyzock's recent inactivity, Burning guesses they may
be just waiting to see how things come out - after all, if their objective is
to terminate all mankind, an asteroid crashing on the Earth would do the job
for them. Blue Jet, however, doesn't think they'd give anybody else the glory
of accomplishing the goal they had set for themselves.

   Elsewhere, Judau's furious to think Haman Karn, who still hasn't appeared
in the battlefield even once, is comfortably watching the Londo Bell's fight.
Mostly, he's angry to realize the wars will continue even after the asteroid
is stopped, and Banjou can relate to that - he too would like to fly straight
to Mars, but one must have his priorities straight, he says.

                                    ****

   At Anaheim Electronics, Princess Romina is driving everyone nuts with her
constant concerns about the situation of her friends. It gets a little better
when she learns the Gundoll Team reconquered Jaburo (thus essentially ending
all fights on the Earth surface) without any casualties, and is set to launch
into space. The Londo Bell, however, is still unheard of...

                                    ****

   Akira finds Execellen behaving strangely, as if in a trance, during which
she calls the Einstregisseur "an inspector". After a while, she comes back to
herself and dismisses any needs of medical attention (confinement?) with the
usual attitude, convincing everybody it was just a lapse - but is more scared
than ever, and wonders if Kyousuke feels the same...

   There isn't much to brief when one's about to invade an unknown asteroid,
so Bright can only warn there's no time left, nor any guarantees this mission
will provide the means to prevent the crash - the exact same disclaimer he's
been saying about every operation, so the crew doesn't even take it seriously
anymore. Better than being overwhelmed by despair, Duke says.

   Abel's actions not only resulted in a defeat, but also apparently had the
Londo Bell prepare to invade Dirad. Now begging for Lady Diore's forgiveness,
he says he just intended to crush the pride of the earthlings and accomplish
his people's dearest wish.

   Shapiro laughs at the fact it was Abel who lost his pride in the end, but
enjoys the outcome of his operation: Sara is coming...

   "The quaked cosmos has come to a halt. The Earth's final hour is coming...
as are the warriors who will oppose it.


   But that fighting won't be the last.

   There are invaders who haven't shown themselves yet;
   The mysterious enemies with their still unknown objectives;
   The reason for the conflicts in space remains, and therefore this struggle
is but just beginning.

   The rushing Londo Bell... and a dragon from the Earth, reaching for these
grounds with the remaining flame of its life.


   When the actors are all together... their story will expand in a whole new
direction."

CONTACT INFORMATION----------------------------------------------------------

   If anyone has questions, comments or suggestions to make, please feel free 
to mail me at the address written on the beginning of this document. However,
before doing that, please pay attention to the following requests/facts:


  - Write "FAQ" as your subject, just so I can separate your mail from junk
    mail and things alike.

  - Due to the amount of mail I receive, I might not be able to respond all
    e-mails. So, if you receive no response, it doesn't mean it hasn't been
    received and/or read. Don't send it over and over.

  - I know the 'canonical' names for mechs and characters from all the Gun-
    dam series; I just happen not to agree with some of them. Do not ask me
    to change that. However, please DO let me know the *official* names for
    any series, especially non-Gundam ones.

  - Feel free to point grammar mistakes or anything like that. English is
    not my native language, and advice is always welcome.

  - Do not ask me where you can get "romz". If it's up to me, you won't get
    them; as a matter of fact, do not ask me ANYTHING about ROMs, emulators
    or patches, nor complain to me if you can't run it on your computer.

  - No 'l33t' language please. What can I say, I just hate it.
