                          - Chip's Challenge -

Most video game sites and magazines judge a game by categories, such as
graphics, sound, control, and gameplay. But if Chip’s Challenge were to
be judged that way, it would fail miserably. In fact the only thing it
has going for it is its charming simplicity and sheer challenge. The
game is indeed a challenge, and not for the faint of heart. What’s truly
amazing is how the game’s creators were able to do so much with so
little. Even with its limited game mechanics, we still get a game with a
stunningly well sculpted 149 levels of challenge. Enjoy.

| 2) BASIC INFORMATION                                                 |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------'


Basic information is all the stuff found in the Chip's Challenge help
file. You must have read that if you're a REAL Chip's Challenge player.
But if you stole this game from a friend without getting the help file,
you've come to the right place! Read on...


        wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
        <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< STORY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
        mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm


[NOTE: This is the exact same story you'll find in the Chip's Challenge
help file. I only copied it for the sole purpose of having a story
section. The story doesn't make any difference in the gameplay and it
will just confuse you. Actually, the Chip's Challenge story sucks.
Anyway, on with the story...]

Chip is willing to do anything for Melinda the Mental Marvel, more than
anything, because he wants to join Melinda's exclusive computer club,
the Bit Busters. Finally Melinda has offered him membership, but on one
condition! Chip must find his way from one end of Melinda's magical
clubhouse to the other, picking up cosmic computer chips along the way.

If that sounds easy, then you've never been to Melinda's magical
clubhouse. It's awesome inside, but tricky, and a little scary too.
There are teleports, invisible walls, force floors, water traps, locked
doors, and plenty of monsters. There's magic, mystery, and behind the
scenes there is Melinda, keeping score on your progress and providing
helpful hints. 

As you succeed in helping Chip move through each level of the clubhouse,
Melinda gives you a secret password that allows you to return. And
Melinda rewards perseverance. If she thinks Chip has tried long enough
and hard enough on a level, she'll let him sneak through to the next
level. But it takes a lot of perseverance to impress her. How big is the
clubhouse? 144 levels is the rumor. But some claim that Melinda is still
building. In any case, it defies dimensions so don't get lost.

        <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< HOW TO PLAY >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
        mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm


[NOTE: The "How to Play" section of this guide is very extensive. I will
not only tell you basic information here, but I will cover every other
facet of playing you will ever need to know in Chip's Challenge. If you
are knew to the game and just want to start playing, read only the first
three or four paragraphs. Reading the rest of this section will only
confuse you... you will learn everything else as you continue playing.]

Like in most games, you beat the game by passing through all of the
levels. And in this game, there are a total of 149 levels! To pass
through a level you must find the exit square. This exit square is
usually blocked by a chip socket which you cannot pass through without
getting all of the chips. So in most stages, the objective is to find
all the chips, pass through the chip socket, and go in the exit square.
However, several levels do not have any chips-- and the only objective
is to get to the exit square. Although this sounds easy, it can be very
very hard.

Oh yes, the very basic basic information: To control Chip, use the arrow
keys on you keyboard (at least that's what I use). You can also use the
numeric keys at the left of your key board. Another way of playing which
feels extremely awkward, is to control Chip with the mouse. To use the
mouse in controlling Chip, click on the square you want him to go to.
Unfortunately, you cannot control the path Chip takes in getting to
that square. He will attempt to get there in a strait line. If there is
an obstacle in Chip's way, he will smash right into it (whether it is a
wall, monster, or whatever). I prefer to use the arrow keys.

As you play, there are two windows for you to pay attention to: The
Action Window and the Information Window. The Action window shows you
all the action, it shows Chip in his surroundings. The information
window shows you other important stuff. This window is divided into four
sections: The level, time, chips left, and inventory. The level is the
number of the level that Chip is currently on (out of 149 levels). The
time display shows you the seconds remaining that Chip has to complete
the level (sometimes you have unlimited time). If the time runs out
before you can finish the level, you will restart. The "chips left"
display shows you the remaining number of chips you need to collect in
order to pass through the chip socket (sometimes you don't need any
chips... and other times there are more chips than you actually need).
And finally, the inventory box at the bottom displays the items you have
collected in that stage (these items are not passed on to the next
stage). Sometimes, you may find a question mark symbol on a square. If
you step on this square, a hint box will appear in the information
window, covering the chips remaining display and inventory box. This
appears in the 8 lesson stages (level 001-008). After that, the
question mark square appear only very rarely.

There are several items you'll find that Chip can use to pass through
the different levels. There are the keys... and the boots. There are
four different kinds of key: Red key, green key, yellow key and blue
key. The key allows you to pass through the lock of the same color (ex:
red key lets you pass through the red lock). You can only use the key
once, and you can NEVER use a key for a lock of a different color.
Just like the keys, you will find four different types of footwear: the
flippers, the fire boots, the ice skates, and the suction boots. The
flippers allow you to swim through the water without drowning. The fire
boots let you walk through the fire without getting burned. Ice skates
let you walk on the ice without sliding. The suction boots let you walk
on a force floor without getting "forced" in a direction. Not all of
these items are found in every stage.

Also on this hellish clubhouse, you will encounter obstacles and traps
along your way. Here is a table presenting the different obstacles:

 Walls         -  They are dark gray squares. They form the boundaries
                  of the level. Chip cannot go through them.
 Thin walls    -  These are thin walls that block the passage between
                  two squares.
 Blue walls    -  These walls take up one block and are colored green-
                  blue. When you touch it, it may or may not be real.
 Invisible walls- This kind of wall cannot be seen or noticed until you
                  bump into it. It may or may not become visible.
 Recessed walls-  Recessed walls look like a large gray dot. They pop up
                  when you step on it... but they do not kill you.
 Colored doors -  Colored doors require a key of the same color for Chip
                  to pass through. I usually refer to them as "locks".
 Toggle doors  -  Toggle doors look like walls with a green border. They
                  open and close when a green button is pushed.
 Bear traps    -  This will trap anything that steps on it. You can open
                  the bear trap by holding down the brown button.
 Bombs         -  Bombs will kill anything that touches it. To get rid of
                  these bombs, use a monster or a block on it.
 Force floors  -  Force floors will push Chip in the direction it is
                  pointing unless Chip has suction boots.
 Fire          -  Fire burns Chip (of course). Chip will not get hurt if
                  he steps on fire with fire boots.
 Water         -  Water drowns anything that steps into it. You won't
                  get hurt if you are wearing the flippers.
 Ice           -  When Chip steps on ice, he will slide wildly out of
                  control... unless you have the ice skates.
 Teleport      -  A teleport looks like a large blue dot. It will warp
                  Chip to another teleport if he steps on it.
 Clone machines-  This will create a clone of a monster or a block. It
                  is activated by pushing a small red dot.
 Blocks        -  You can use these blocks to make a bridge on water,
                  detonate bombs, hold open bear traps, and other stuff.
 Dirt          -  Dirt is like normal floor... but monsters cannot step
                  on it. It turns to normal floor when you step on it.
 Gravel        -  Gravel serves the same purpose as dirt: monsters can't
                  step on it. But it doesn't turn back to normal floor.

Also in this clubhouse of death, you will find several monsters of
different types. These monsters have different movement patterns and
abilities. But all of them will kill you if you touch them. Here's the
table of all the kinds of monsters:

 Blobs          -  Blobs have a completely random movements. They go
                   around and are unpredictable. See level 023 :)
 Pink balls     -  Pink balls go back and forth and bounce back when they
                   hit a wall.
 Bugs           -  Bugs follow the wall on their left side. They often
                   appear in large groups.
 Fireballs      -  Fireballs turn right when they hit a wall or any
                   object. You are not protected by the fire boots!
 Gliders        -  Gliders have a pattern similar to the fireballs-- but
                   they turn LEFT when they hit a wall or object.
 Paramecia      -  These little guys follow the wall at their right
                   side. It amazing that they can hurt Chip (paramecium)
 Tanks          -  Tanks can be controlled by stepping on a blue dot. At
                   other times, they remain stagnant.
 Teeth          -  These are deadly! They try to follow you when ever
                   you go in a straight line. You can out run them.
 Walkers        -  Walkers turn in a random direction whenever they hit
                   a wall or object. Very unpredictable.
 Spies          -  These do not kill you. Instead, they take your items
                   from the inventory box.

        <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< SCORING >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
        mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm


No, you don't have to keep your own score in this game. This section is
intended to help you understand the score showed to you at the end of
each level...

At the end of each level, the score for that level is displayed to you.
It consists of four parts: The time bonus, the level bonus, the level
score, and the total score.

The time bonus is the bonus points you get for the time you have
remaining. The seconds remaining is multiplied by 10 for this score. For
example: If you have 50 seconds left, the time bonus would be 500. Some
levels are not timed, and therefore you will not get any time bonus for
that level.

The level bonus is the score you get for defeating this level at all! To
get this score, you multiply the level number by 500. So if you just
beat level 6, your score would be 3000. If you had to restart this
level, this score is subtracted by 20% each time you restart. To prevent
losing points after you die, choose "Best Times" from the Game menu...
then double click on the level you are now on.

The level score is the total score of adding both the time bonus and the
level bonus. This is what is displayed beside the level number in the
"Best Times" window.

The total score is the ultimate score for your game. It is the total of
adding all of the level scores from every stage you have completed so
far.

'----------------------------------------------------------------------'


LEVEL 001 - LESSON 1
Password: BDHP

This is the fastest route I've tried. First, go right and get the chip
and two red keys. Go into the red lock on the upper right and get the
yellow key and the chip. Go out and get the chip and two blue keys on
the left side. Go through the blue lock on the upper left and get the
chip and yellow keys inside. Next, go through the red lock on the
bottom left and get the chip inside. Now go through the two yellow
locks at the bottom and get the keys and chips there (also get the chip
between the two yellow locks). Go through the blue lock at the bottom
right at get the chip. And finally, go through the two green locks at
the top to get the final chips. Of course, go through the socket and
into the exit square.



LEVEL 002 - LESSON 2
Password: JXMJ

First get the easy two chips at your right. Then push those two brown
blocks to form a bridge across the water. Remember that you need to
pound the blocks into the water to make them become solid. Cross your
bridge. Avoid the bugs going around the area and get the chips at the
top and bottom. Great, now you have all the chips. Pass through the
socket and into the exit square.



LEVEL 003 - LESSON 3
Password: ECBQ

This is the stage where you get to try on your boots! First, pick up the
flippers. The flippers let you swim in water without drowning, so get
the chip and the ice skates from the island in the middle of the water.
The ice skates let you stand on ice without slipping, so get the fire
boots and the chip from the ice at the left. The fire boots let you step
in fire without getting burned, so get the suction boots and the chip
from the fire at the right. The suction boots let you step on force
floors without getting pulled, so get the chip from the force floor at
the bottom (the green floor) and go around to pass through the socket
and into the exit square.



LEVEL 004 - LESSON 4
Password: YMCJ

First, go into the passage at the bottom that leads to a room with five
blocks forming an "X". The four blocks on the outside have chips under
them. But the center block has fire under it! So push the four outside
blocks to get the chips. When you're done with that, go back to where
you started and into the place at the left. Stepping on the green dots
in this place open or close the "toggle walls" (the walls with a green
border). Get the four chips from this toggle wall maze (I don't think
this requires a detailed walkthrough). When you got all 4 chips from
that place, go to the left of where you started. Stepping on the blue
dots makes the tanks change position. So step on the blue dot, then on
the other one, and the other one and get the chip. Do the same process
to get out of the tank maze. Go through the socket and into the exit
square.



LEVEL 005 - LESSON 5
Password: TQKB

First, go up the passage at the right and step on the green dot to open
the toggle wall. Step on the green dot again when the pink ball in on
the left side of the toggle wall, now he's trapped there. The use of
this is to prevent him from making fireball clones. Now go back down to
where you started and get the red key at the left side of the fire. Go
up again and go through the red lock. Step on the brown dots to release
the glider. Step on the other brown dot to release the glider again and
make him get rid of the bomb. Go into the exit square.



LEVEL 006 - LESSON 6
Password: WNLD

See the green walls on your left and right? Those are called "blue
walls". When you push yourself against the wall, it will either
disappear or turn into a gray (permanent) wall. There are also some
invisible walls that appear only when you bump into them. And there are
some invisible walls that don't appear at all! Okay, enough with the
lessons. First, go through the second blue block to the bottom on your
left side. Now an invisible wall is there between you and the chips. Go
through a blue block above you and again go through a blue block above
the chips. Get the four chips and backtrack to the place where you
started. Go through the socket and into the exit square.



LEVEL 007 - LESSON 7
Password: FXQO

Some things to remember before you get started here: The spies take all
your items, and the blue dots transport you to another blue dot. Okay?
First, go through the blue dot. Go through the spy and get the chip. Go
back through the spy again and go UP into the blue dot. Get the
flippers. Go into the blue dot from the LEFT, and again from the RIGHT,
and once more from the LEFT. Do not get the fire boots! Just go straight
into the water and ride the force floor to a chip and the spy. Now you
are back in the room where you started. Enter the blue dot from the
LEFT, and again from the RIGHT to bring you to the fire boot room. Get
the fire boots and enter the blue dot from the BOTTOM. Go through the
fire and ride the force floor to the final chip and the spy. You are
in the beginning room again. Go through the blue dot and through the
socket... into the exit square.



LEVEL 008 - LESSON 8
Password: NHAG

Okay, you start this level on the left side of the gravel and dirt. The
gravel and the dirt is separating you from the teeth on the hard
concrete. You need to get only one chip... and that chip in on the
cement that the teeth is standing on. You need to trick the teeth: move
up to lure him upwards, then quickly move down and run past him. Hurry
and get the lone chip at the center of the cement and continue to the
exit square at the right side.



LEVEL 009 - NUTS AND BOLTS
Password: KCRE

This is the first "challenging" level. First, go down and get the yellow
key (watch out for the fireballs!). Go back up, get the chip and go past
the yellow lock. Go to the top square at the left of the force floors
and hold right to go through a blue block and into a place with four
brown blocks. Use the four brown blocks to make a bridge across the
water (remember to step on the blocks to make them solid) and get the
red key. Go through the red lock and take this path on the ice: Right,
down, left, up, left, down, right, up, left, down, right, right, down,
left, up, left, up. If you followed the path correctly, you must have
gotten the chip and arrived at the next place. Now cross the green dot
and go up to the blue key. Step on the green dot to open/close the
toggle walls, and use the blue key to get the yellow key. Continue this
process to get the green and red key. Before taking the ice path behind
the red key, be sure that you won't bump into any fireballs. The ice
path leads you to a place where bugs are moving along a path. Wait until
there are no nearby bugs before you get the two chips on this path. Take
the path on the left and go through the blue block at the bottom to get
the chip. Go back to the bug room and take the path at the bottom. Move
the four blocks so that they destroy the four bombs. Get the chip where
the four blocks where, get two more chips in the place with a bunch of
other bombs, and get the chip hiding under the remaining brown block.
Backtrack to the "bug room" and go through the socket on the right.
You're in a whole new room! Move the brown block over the small brown
block to open the beartrap and release the fireball. Quickly move over
the beartrap and enter the exit square (before the fireball gets back).



LEVEL 010 - BRUSHFIRE
Password: UVWS

This level doesn't have any chips. It's all about action! Well, not too
much action really. You need to navigate yourself through a maze of fire
and avoid any bugs you might encounter here. The method I usually use
is to follow the wall on Chip's left-hand side. Eventually, I am able to
see the exit and get there. But if you really need the shortest way to
get there, here's the shortest path to the exit square: 4D-4R-4U-12R-3D-
3L-U1-L7-7D-1L-3D-8R-1U-10R-10D-4R-2U-1L-3U-1R-2U-1L-6U-3R-18D-5L-2U-10L
-7U-5R. For the above path, D means DOWN, U means up, L means LEFT, and
R means RIGHT. A number before the letter means that's how many steps to
take (ex: 8R means eight steps to the right).



LEVEL 011 - TRINITY
Password: CNPE

Trinity means "three". And there are three parts to this stage! First,
get the three keys. The red key is in the upper-left part of the stage
with a fireball. The yellow key is at the bottom part of the stage with
a bug. The blue key is at the upper-right part of the stage with a
glider. Once you have all three keys, return to the center part of the
stage and use the three keys on the three locks to get the three boots.
Get the chip from the water. Get the chip from the fire. And get the
chip from the left part of the ice. Then go to the right part of the ice
to pass through the socket and into the exit square.



LEVEL 012 - HUNT
Password: WVHI

This stage is probably called "Hunt" because you're "Hunting" for chips.
In this stage you will need to find 652 of them in 400 seconds (don't
worry too much about the time, it's enough for you). You will also need
to worry about the two teeth in here. It's best to work your way around
the outside edges first before going inside with the teeth. When you
finally need to go inside, go fast! Be sure to check the chip meter
because there's more than 652 chips in this place. When you've collected
everything you need, enter the exit square in the center.



LEVEL 013 - SOUTHPOLE
Password: OCKS

I was stuck in this stage for about a week until a found out a clue from
the name "SOUTHPOLE". Its not just called "SOUTHPOLE" because it's cold
all around, but also it tells you the directions to take in this
monolith maze of ice. There's no need to worry about the time because
it's unlimited! Anyway, here's the 6-step path to take: Down, down,
down, down, down, down.



LEVEL 014 - TELEBLOCK
Password: BTDY

First, get the red key and go through the teleport. Now you're in a room
with four red locks around you. Go into the bottom lock and push one
brown block into the teleport without going in yourself. Now enter the
teleport through a DIFFERENT direction (ex: if you pushed the block in
the teleport from the bottom, enter from the left, right, or top). Now
you are in a "water room". Push the brown block into the water and step
on it to make it hard. Go into the teleport and go in again to transport
to the room with the red locks. Go into the bottom, get the key, and
push the block into the teleport. Go in through a different direction
and complete the bridge you started earlier with the other block. Go
back to the lock room and continue the process. [NOTE: Be sure to go
through the lock on the right LAST because there is no red key inside.]



LEVEL 015 - ELEMENTARY
Password: COZQ

First, go left and get the red key. Go through the lock directly below
you a push the brown block to the bomb to destroy it. While you were
pushing that brown block, you got the flippers that was hidden under it!
Okay, get the blue key there. Get out to the main area and go straight
up to enter the blue lock. Push the brown block into the bomb again and
get the red key there. This time, you got the suction boots that were
hidden under the block. Go back to the central area and go to the RIGHT
side. Get the blue key there and enter the red and blue lock and do the
same thing you did at the other side (getting the fire boots and ice
skates along the way). Now there are four section for you to finish: the
ice, the fire, the water, and the force floors. Go into each section one
at a time and get THREE CHIPS and ONE KEY from each one. You need to be
fast because your time here is very limited. When you are done with
these areas, go back to the central area. Unlock the blue and red lock.
Now, get rid of the socket and push the brown block over the small brown
block to keep the bear trap open. Yay, you can walk over the bear trap
to the exit square.



LEVEL 016 - CELLBLOCKED
Password: SKKK

This stage is completely composed of recessed walls (walls that pop out
of the ground as soon as Chip steps on them). This means that is Chip
makes a single mistake, he will have to start the level all over again.
This level isn't timed so you have all the time in the world to make
mistakes. To find the exit square: Go right four steps, go down twelve
steps, go four steps right. Now you should change direction at every
chance you get unless you are obviously going to hit a dead end. That
should help you find the exit. The highest score possible on this level
is 8000 (if you didn't restart the level).



LEVEL 017 - NICE DAY
Password: AJMG

This level is shaped like a HUGE happy face. There are six chips each
composing the eyes, and the other 36 chips are composing the mouth.
While getting these chips, be very careful to avoid the pink balls and
the walkers (there's a lot of them!). When you have all the chips you
need, go into any of the exit squares at the four corners of the level.



LEVEL 018 - CASTLE MOAT
Password: HMJL

This stage is much easier than it seems to be. Although it looks like to
need to build a bridge of brown blocks over the water, all you need to
do is find the flippers and use them to swim over the water! First,
follow the obvious path around until you reach the part with all the
brown blocks. Now try to find a path to the brown block near the top-
right corner of this brown block maze. Push away the block and you'll
receive the flippers! Now retrace you steps back to the water place.
Swim across the water (avoiding the fire) to the castle. Go through the
sockets and into the exit square. [NOTE: You went through the sockets
without getting a single chip! Actually, there are no chips in this
stage. Therefore you don't need to get any (obviously).]



LEVEL 019 - DIGGER
Password: MRHR

This stage is full of teeth and chips. You need to collect all 146 of
them! First, try getting all of the chips but DON'T get the chips that
would allow the teeth to get free. Also remember not the free the teeth
by digging a path in the dirt for them (the teeth can't go on the dirt).
After getting all of the chips except the ones that would free the
teeth, carefully trick the teeth into going one way-- then quickly run
to get the chip. You need to be very quick in this part. Get all of the
remaining chips while avoiding the teeth. When all the chips are
collected, go through the socket and into the exit square (as usual :)



LEVEL 020 - TOSSED SALAD
Password: KGFP

There's something very strange about this stage that you should know
about: Even though it says "15 chips left", there is NO socket that you
need to go through. That means you don't need to collect any chips!
Okay, take the path around to the bottom right where you cross some
gravel. Cross it and step into the blue dot to transport yourself to the
other side of the room. Now go downward carefully and avoid the blue
tanks going back and forth. At the end of the path you will find a red
key. Get that key and slowly take the same path back to the red lock.
After passing through the red lock, you will go across a force floor
path and see four chips surrounded by fire. Don't worry about that
(remember: you don't need to get any chips!). Cross the path of ice, get
the fire boots, and cross another force floor path. Go to the place
where the pink ball is crossing and wait. When it is on your right side,
quickly move down and left and up to safety. Follow the path across a
tile of force floor and another tile of fire. Take the force floor path
at the left to arrive near some blue tanks going back and forth. Right
after the tanks move, go down and get the yellow key. Run back up to the
part above the tanks... then cross the part where the pink balls are
going back and forth to reach the yellow lock. Go through the yellow
lock and enter the exit square.



LEVEL 021 - ICEBURG
Password: UGRW

See the small red dot at the left side? Stepping on that dot causes a
brown block to appear. Okay, make a block and push it into the bridge of
ice. Follow it and pound it into the ground to make it permanent. Do
this two more times to form a *complete* bridge going all the way to the
chip socket. But the only problem is that we don't have the chips yet :(
Go back to the beginning. If you stand beside the water at the top part
of the land, you can see an incomplete ice bridge located two blocks to
the right of the bridge you just completed. So use three brown blocks to
complete that bridge. At the end of the bridge is a new island with the
chips! Get all nine of the chips and go back to the beginning. Take the
original bridge you made to the socket and the exit square.



LEVEL 022 - FORCED ENTRY
Password: WZIN

The name says it all for this level. The entire floor is composed of a
huge jumble of force floor that will try to pull you all around this
place like crazy. You start this level in the upper left corner. The
exit square is at the complete opposite end of the room: the lower right
corner. Of course, there is a socket blocking the exit square and you
need to collect the chips from all around the mess of force floors.
There is a blue teleport block near the start that will bring you to the
socket blocking the exit square (but you don't have the chips). You need
to "force your way through". The frustration can be very intense. Just
keep cool and be patient-- you have lots of time.



LEVEL 023 - BLOBNET
Password: HUVE

This level take a lot of time-- and a lot of patience. There are chips
scattered around the level and they are protected by an army of blobs.
Remember that you are safe from them on the black gravel and they can't
get to you there. To make sure you don't get hurt by the blobs while
getting the chips, wait until there are no blobs on the squares
surrounding the chip you want to get. Then quickly get the chip and move
back on the gravel. You need to get a total of 88 chips in this level.
Be very patient and be sure to follow the tip above for every time you
get a chip or each time you pass on the cement. This level isn't really
hard, the only problem is that you'll get impatient easily and get
killed by the blobs. When you've collected all 88 chips, go to the exit
square in the middle.



LEVEL 024 - OORTO GELD
Password: UNIZ

Oorto Geld is an anagram for "Toggle Door". This place is full of toggle
doors that must be operated by the gliders. You start the stage in the
center of the level. First go to the third brown block from the left at
the top wall (the one over the first exit square). Push the brown block
up so that it touches the wall at the upper left corner of the green
switch. Soon the gliders will come and start going around in a loop,
automatically hitting the green switch. Now the toggle doors are opening
and closing in a pattern: long open and quick close.. or long close and
quick open. In any case, enter each of the rooms and get the chips from
their chambers. If you want the pattern of opening and closing to
switch, simply hit one of the green switches. Watch out for the gliders
patrolling the individual rooms. When you're done collecting the chips,
go to the exit square in the center (where you started).



LEVEL 025 - BLINK
Password: PQGV

This is really a bad ass level. You need to go around this stage
collecting chips by going through the teleports a bunch of times. It's
almost impossible to tell where you're going and that's what makes this
level so hard. To do this level, you either do it alone... or follow my
instructions step by step from the beginning to the end. Okay? So here
goes: Go up through the teleport and continue up to get the chip. Go
back down through the teleport and get another chip. Go up through the
teleport and follow the path to another chip. Go back down through the
teleport and get the chip there (don't go through the new teleport). Go
up through the teleport and get a chip. Go down through the teleport and
get the chip at the left (ignore the new teleport again). Go up through
the teleport and get a chip... this time go right through the new
teleport. Get the chip, ignore the new teleport, and go left through the
old teleport. Get the chip and go back. Get the two chips. Now go in the
teleport and go back in again. Get the chip and go back. Get the chip
and go back. Get the chip and go back. Now you are back at the part
where you switched teleports. Go in the teleport and go in the new
teleport. Get the chip. Go in the teleport and go in again. Get the chip
and go back (only 12 chips left!). Go back in the teleport. Get the two
chips and go back in (vertically). Get the two chips and go back. Get
another two chips and go back................ Oh damn I'm lost! Well,
I'm sure you can do the rest by yourself, right? You only have 6 chips
left to find. Good luck!



LEVEL 026 - CHCHCHIPS
Password: YVYJ

First, get the 11 chips along the left wall. Then get the 9 chips along
the top wall (watch out for the pink ball!). Now you may notice that
there is a group of chips in the middle with a paramecium crawling all
over it. Remember that he crawls along the wall at his right side. So
get as much chips as you can while keeping at a safe distance away from
him. Then get all but one of the chips. Then carefully get the last one,
avoiding the paramecia. If you die, start over and try again. Now get
the chips around the pink ball at the bottom left part of the level...
but DO NOT get the one blocking the pink ball from the clone switch.
That switch controls the cloning of teeth. Now get the chips along the
bottom floor. Follow the path and continue to get all of the chips at
the bottom right of the level. You should now have about 34 chips left.
Next, get the chips along the right wall and follow the path of chips
and get all of them until you only have 1 chip left. Remember the chip
between the pink ball and the clone switch? Get that one and run up to
the upper left corner to the exit square.



LEVEL 027 - GO WITH THE FLOW
Password: IGGZ

See that force floor path right below you? Take that path and turn left
where there is a chip and a blue switch. Get the chip and hit the blue
switch ONCE. Continue on the force floor path an immediately turn left at
your next chance to get a chip. Continue on the force floor path and
ride it until you reach solid ground. Now you should see a line of water
below you. Push the four blocks to form a bridge to the other side of
that water to get the flippers. Go back to near the beginning of the
force floors. There is some fire boots at your left? Watch out for the
tank and get them. Now get on the force floors and turn left at the
first chance you get. Go past the recessed wall and go down passed the
water (you have the flippers) to the chip. Go up the water and out the
other recessed wall. Get back on the force floors and turn left at your
second chance to hit the blue switch. Get back on the force floors and
turn left at the parts where there are three chips to get them. Zero
chips left! Go to the place with the blue tanks. Watch out for them and
enter the exit square.



LEVEL 028 - PING PONG
Password: UJDO

The first thing you should do here is do the only thing you can: Ride
the force floors around. While you go around, try pushing against the
blue blocks to make them solid. When you're getting close to the place
where you first started, push down on the second to the last block to go
through. Now you're in the main area. Go down and get the Chip on the
left wall (watch out for the pink ball). Now go right and get the two
chips there. Continue and go to the right side and get the two chips
there. Go back to the left where the brown blocks are. You need to make
a bridge across the water with these blocks. Be sure not to waste any
because you will still need two blocks for later. When you're done with
that bridge, cross it to go to the next area. Get the Chip at the left
side and go right to get two more chips. There are pink balls all over
now, be careful. Continue to the right side for another Chip. Now cross
the ice and get the four chips on this strip of land. Now you need to
make another bridge across the water. Go back up to the place with the
brown blocks, you should have two blocks left. Bring them down to the
next body of water and build a bridge over it. Get the four chips from
this area, then go down across the ice for the final four chips. Now you
have all the chips! Go up to the top and enter the exit square.



LEVEL 029 - ARTICFLOW
Password: QGOL

You start this level on a land with five brown blocks. Use those five
blocks to build a bridge across the water. Now you have arrived at
ANOTHER piece of land with five brown blocks. Again, use those blocks to
build a bridge across the water. Now you only have three brown blocks.
Build another bridge ALONG THE UPPER WALL. If you build it anywhere else
it won't reach the land. Follow the narrow path to three blocks with a
paramecia going around them. Push the middle block two spaces to the
left. The push another block to continue the bridge you just started.
Now the paramecia going around one block. Push that block once to the
left so that is beside the water... the paramecia will drown there. Now
use the final block to complete the bridge. There is another paramecia
crawling around the new set of blocks now. Be careful and push the
middle block into the water at the left. Pound it down and put another
block in the water there to complete the bridge. Cross that bridge and
take the ice path all the way to the flippers. You can't take the ice
path going back since you crossed a force floor on your way here. Just
find a path to swim back. When you get back to the place where the
blocks are, swim down into the water and get all the chips there. Take
the path back to the socket and swim to the exit square.



LEVEL 030 - MISHMESH
Password: BQZP

This level is a maze of blue blocks. Some of them are real blocks, some
of them are not. To get through this maze you need to go around pushing
yourself again these blocks trying to get to the chips. I won't tell you
the EXACT directions on how to beat this level (that would be too long
and hard to follow). Instead, you should just try to clear everything
you can (push yourself against all the blue blocks to see if they're real
or not). When most of them are done, you should be able to find a path
to each of the 36 chips in this level. This level isn't really as hard
as it seems, as long as you have patience in doing it. When you have
collected all the chips, go to the exit square (as usual).



LEVEL 031 - KNOT
Password: RYMS

This is a hard level because of the extremely limited time you are given.
You only have 29 seconds to get all 118 chips! Here's the path to take:
Go forward to the first chip, then turn up to the force floor, right to
another force floor, down to a place between four fires, then left to
the first chip. Now move down to the force floor, left to the place
between four fires, down to a force floor (go around it), left to
another force floor (go around again), up to the place between four
fires, then left until there are no more chips. Now go up and left to
another place between four fires. Next go up six steps, right six steps,
down six steps, left six steps, down six steps, right six steps, and
up six steps. By now you only have 2 or 3 seconds left so hurry to the
exit square to finish the level.



LEVEL 032 - SCAVENGER HUNT
Password: PEFS

This level is a large maze with thin walls. There are only three chips
that you need to get, but these chips are guarded by fire, water, or a
force floor. To get past these barriers, you must find the appropriate
boots for the barrier (the flippers, the fire boots, or the suction
boots). The fire boots are found at the bottom left, the suction boots
are near the top, and the flippers can be found at the upper right
corner of the level. After getting these, you can now go find the three
chips! The chip guarded by the force floor is at the left side, the chip
guarded by the fire is near the middle, and the chip guarded by the
water is at the right side. When you got all these, go to the exit
square at the center.



LEVEL 033 - ON THE ROCKS
Password: BQSN

Like so many other levels, patience is the key for this level. You start
on this little island with a block cloning machine. Most of the level is
water, so you need to start using the blocks to build a path to the
different chips and eventually the exit square (located at the upper
right corner). It's a good thing that this level isn't timed, cause it's
going to take you a looooong time. Along the way you'll find other block
cloning machines to help you. Good luck!



LEVEL 034 - CYPHER
Password: NQFI

Ha! This level is so easy that is seems like a bonus! Anyway, you can
easily follow the path of letters and collect the needed chips along the
way. Avoid the bugs and eventually you will reach the exit square. By
the way, do you know the secret meaning of those letters? If you make a
map of the level and view it from far, you will see that there are three
rows of four letters each. Each row tells you a different password for
another level in Chip's Challenge. The first row tells the password for
level 082: LLIO. The second row tells the password for level 137: HPPX.
And finally, the third row shows the password for level 146: JHEN.



LEVEL 035 - LEMMINGS
Password: VDTM

There are two parts of this level: The outside, which really has nothing
but a few blocks in the lower right corner, and the inside, which has a
bunch of fireballs guarding the chips. Go to the inside and stay beside
the entrance to the fireball part. The trick to getting the chips there
without being damaged by the fireballs is the first lead them out of
their pattern and make them go into the pool of water. So get a brown
block from outside and put in on the third block from the right side at
the place where the fireballs are. Then push it one step to the right so
that it is over the other gray block. After a while, they will start
going into the water... but there are still some others left. Disrupt
their pattern by pushing a block in their way. Hopefully, they'll find
their way to the water and not hurt you. When most of them are gone, you
should be able to get all the chips... and when you are finished doing
that, go to the lower left corner of the inner area. Get the chip socket
and quickly move away, allowing the fireball to pass through. Go into the
exit square.



LEVEL 036 - LADDER
Password: NXIS

First, go left and get the blue chip, but don't go past the recessed
wall. Go right and down until you reach the first recessed wall at the
left. Pass by there and get the two chips, then go down through another
recessed wall and get two more chips. Continue doing this until you
reach the bottom (you should have only 12 chips remaining). Exit through
the right and go down until you reach the second recessed wall at your
left. Take that path and collect the chips and the blue key. When you
reach the end, take the top path of recessed walls to go back. Now go
up and turn left (at the place without recessed walls) into a long
passage. Go passed the blue lock at the end. There's a brown button
there-- push it and quickly step down to avoid getting hit by the tank.
Go around and pass by the bear trap that the tank was on. Ignore that
second tank (for now) and go left to a place with lots of bear traps.
The switch to open each bear trap is at its left. So be sure not to
step on any open bear traps and push the brown block over the brown
button to hold the bear trap open. Then step on the green button and go
down to open the next bear trap (remember not to step on any). Continue
doing this until you reach the bottom and get the chip. Now go back to
the top where the second blue tank is. Hit the brown switch and step
away to avoid him. Go up past the bear trap and go left where there's a
lot of other bear traps. This is the same thing as before, except this
time it's going up. Do the same thing you did in the other place until
you reach the chip at the top. Then go back down and right to the third
tank. Again, step on the brown switch and step away. Do this again to
the next one. On the last one, take two steps up to get the chip, and
quickly take two steps down to avoid the tank. Pass through the blue
lock and get the red key (DO NOT go through the recessed wall!). Go down
to the very bottom to the path where you got a lot of chips. Take the
bottom path of recessed walls, through the red lock, through the chip
socket, and into the exit square.



LEVEL 037 - SEEING STARS
Password: VQNK

In this stage, there are 56 chips you need to collect. Each of these
chips are in groups of two... and each group of two chips is behind a
"barrier" of water. In order to collect these chips, you must use the
blocks to form a land bridge over the water. But make sure you use only
ONE block for each barrier of water, because you will need all the
blocks you have! Try to be careful not to push the block into a corner
or any position where it would get stuck. You have plenty of time on
this level, 800 seconds. When you are done collecting all the chips, you
might have as many as two extra blocks that you didn't use to cover the
water. The exit square is at the place where you started.



LEVEL 038 - SAMPLER
Password: BIFA

In this level, you must go through the teleporter and collect different
items in order. Follow these directions: First, get the green key. Then
go through the teleporter *vertically* four times. Now there is a green
lock at the bottom right corner-- go through it and get the suction
boots. Enter the teleporter once to return to the beginning. Now, go
through the teleporter four times through the *side*. Cross the force
floor at the bottom right corner to get the chip. Enter the teleporter
once to return to the beginning. Go through the teleporter twice
vertically. Go through the socket at the corner and get the red key. Go
through the teleporter four times vertically. Get the blue key from
behind the red lock (at the bottom corner). Go through the teleporter
four times to return to the beginning. Now go through the teleporter
twice through the *side*. Get the fire boots at the bottom right corner
behind the blue lock. Enter the teleporter again (once) and get the
flippers from behind the fire. Go through the teleporter twice to return
to the beginning. Go through the teleporter three times *vertically*.
Hit the green button behind the water. Go through the teleporter two
times vertically... then once from the side. Get the yellow key at the
bottom right corner. Enter the teleporter four more times... and go into
the exit square at the bottom right corner (behind the yellow lock).


LEVEL 039 - GLUT
Password: ICXY

This is a very easy level... when you realize that there is another exit</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
besides the one blocked by the monsters. You need to get only 29 chips
in this level. And you only have 29 seconds, but it's still very easy.
The other exit is lower and more to the right of the exit squares
blocked by monsters. You should be able to get most of the chips while
just getting to the exit square.



LEVEL 040 - FLOORGASBORG
Password: YWFH

This level has all the traps and obstacles you can think of: fire,
water, force floors, ice, spies. You need to collect the items in the
correct order so that they will help you get to the exit and not get
stolen by the spies. First, go up into the force floors and HOLD the up
button. Can you see the spy and the fire boots there? Press down so that
you would go to the spy beside the fire boots (you won't lose anything
because you don't *have* anything). Get the fire boots and walk across
the fire to go back to the beginning of the stage (you also need to
slide across the ice). When you reach the beginning, take the same path
up through the force floors and move LEFT so that you take a narrow path
of force floors to get to the flippers. Now go down into the fire, and
follow the path of fire left until the path ends by the suction boots.
Get those suction boots (don't touch that spy!). If you take one step
up, you should be able to see the exit square at the upper left corner.
Go swim across the water, slide across the ice, walk through the fire,
past the force floors and finally into the exit square.



LEVEL 041 - I.C. YOU
Password: GKWD

There are a bunch of bugs going around the edges of the course in a
line. Wait for a break in their pattern and get in and join them. Get
the four chips at very corner for a total of 16 chips. Then go to the
hint block at the left side of the exit square. When you step of it, a
clue about how to travel trough the teleports (1st:rdul - 2nd:lulu). So
enter the 1st teleport (the one at the left, near the hint) by traveling
right (meaning you enter from the left side). Move the block upwards and
get the four chips there. Now go back and enter the teleport by
traveling down (enter from the top). Push the block away and get four
more chips. Go back and enter by traveling up (enter from the bottom).
Move the block away and get the four chips. Go back and enter the
teleport by traveling left (enter from the right). Move the block away
and get four more chips. Enter the teleport one more time vertically to
return to the main room. Now follow the second sequence of directions at
THE SAME teleport. Enter by travelling left, move the block, get the
chips. Enter by travelling up, move the block, get the chips. Enter by
travelling left, move the block, get ALL of the chips. And enter by
travelling up, move the block, and get the final 4 chips. Enter once
more through the side to return to the main area where you can enter the
exit square.



LEVEL 042 - BEWARE OF BUG
Password: LMFU

This level is made of a big spiral with a block of water at the outside
end. Several enemies are in this spiral an they're moving in their
regular pattern. On your way from the outside to the inside, you must
collect the chips and avoid the bugs at the same time by hiding in
either the outside corner or inside corner. It all depends on the
movement patterns of these enemies. All of the enemies here EXCEPT the
bug with drown in the water when they reach it. The bug will turn around
and try to get you from behind (hence the name "Beware of bug"). Here's
the solution: Go left to the upper left corner and get the chip. Stay in
the outside corner until a paramecium passes by you. Continue down to
the next corner and get the chip. This time, stay in the place when the
chip was and wait for a fireball to go by. Continue going really fast to
the upper right corner (getting the chip along the way) and wait in the
place where the chip is. Soon a bug will go past you. This is the bug to
beware of because he won't drown in the water. Instead, he will turn
around and try to get you from behind. Run to the next corner and wait
in the place where the chip is for a glider to pass by. Continue to the
next corner and get the chip... wait in the outside (not where the chip
was) for a paramecium to pass you. Now as fast as you can to the center
of the spiral (collecting chips along the way). Go into the exit square
at the center of the spiral.



LEVEL 043 - LOCK BLOCK
Password: UJDP

First, go down and right until the second block to the end. There is a
pink ball going up and down in this area. When it's safe, run up into
the  "safe spot" at the right. When the pink ball is below, run higher
up to get the red key. Retrace your steps back to the bottom. Continue
going right until you reach a block. Push the block upwards into the ice
and quickly move right. Go in front of the line of three brown blocks.
The left block and the middle block have fire under them. Push the right
block into the water and use it to get the fire boots and the blue key.
Go right and use the red key to open the lock. Push the three brown
blocks into the water, forming a bridge. Cross the bridge and take the
path at the left. Go over the recessed walls and get the red key. Take
the path of force floors back to the red lock. Open that lock and use
the blocks to form another bridge across the water. Cross the bridge and
go to the force floors. When it's safe, cross the force floor path and
go down to get a key. Go over the recessed wall and go around to the red
lock. Use the key on the lock and push the blocks over the water like
before. Cross your newly-formed bridge and get the red key at the other
side of the fire (you have the fire boots). Use the blue key on the lock
and push the blocks over the water. At the other side, use the red key
on the lock and push the blocks over the water one last time. Go over to
the other side of the water and into the exit square.



LEVEL 044 - REFRACTION
Password: TXHL

This level is divided into four sections. And each of those sections is
divided into four smaller rooms with two chips each. There is a tank in
each of these rooms which prevents you from getting all the chips. You
must push the blue button and move the tanks to get all of the chips.
Here's how to beat this level: Go down, left, and down into the lower
left section. Get all the chips possible in the four rooms. Press the
blue button found in this section to move the tanks. Now get the
remaining four chips in this section. Leave this section. Push the green
button (found in the long hallway) to open/close the toggle doors. Enter
the upper left section. Get all the chips possible here and exit. Now
go to the upper right section. Get all possible chips, press the blue
button to move the tanks, and get the remaining chips. Exit this section
and go back to the upper left section. Get the remaining chips here.
Exit and go to the lower right section (you'll need to toggle the doors
again). Get all the possible chips here, go to the upper right section
and hit the blue switch, come back to the lower right section and get
the rest of the chips. You have all the chips! Go to the exit square at
the bottom of the level.



LEVEL 045 - MONSTER LAB
Password: OVPZ

In this level, monsters are being manufactured everywhere. To get to the
exit square, you need to stop all of the cloning machines from making
monsters. First, go to where the bugs are being cloned. To stop them, go
into the room at the right and get a block. Push the block to the space
right in front of the cloning button. Now the bugs are stuck there. Do
you see the fire boots and suction boots in the water? Get more blocks
and build a bridge to get them. Go up until you see the tanks and the
blue button. Put some block in the water going to the blue button. Push
the blue button and the tanks will all get stuck. Go down and to the
right of where you started. Go down into the fire. There's a bunch of
fire balls there! Place a block in front of the cloning button to stop
the fireballs from being cloned. Go upwards and past the force floors to
get to the place where the pink balls are being cloned. Put a block
there to stop them. Return to the beginning of the stage and down past
the spy (don't worry about losing your equipment). Use more blocks in
the water to build a path to the exit square.



LEVEL 046 - THREE DOORS
Password: HDQJ

Get the red key and go down from there (don't open the red lock beside
you). You'll arrive at the fire boots. Go one step up to get the green
key and go left. You'll get the flippers. Get the blue key and the chip
and go up from where the chip was. You'll use the key on the red lock.
Press LEFT to return to the previous land and LEFT once more and UP.
You'll go up and pick up a red key (you'll also step on the bear trap
switch to free the pink ball. Back track your steps to return to the
place where you opened the red lock and go UP again to go in the fire.
Go UP again from there. Get the chip and the yellow key. Take the UP
path and the RIGHT path to get two chips. Now return down to the fire.
Follow this path: L,L,L,L,U,R,D,L,L,R,D. You'll follow a force floor
path into the water. Go through the yellow door and get the chips and
yellow key (DO NOT step on the green switch or step on the recessed
wall). Return to the water and go through the blue lock. Get all the
stuff you find there and return. Go back on the force floor path (you
have the suction boots) and up on the ice. Go through the four colored
locks, passed the recessed wall, through the chip socket, and into the
teleport. Go through the LEFT recessed wall and into the exit square.



LEVEL 047 - PIER SEVEN
Password: LXPP

The objective of this level is to build a bridge to the center of the
lake where the four chips are. You only have seven blocks and there's
only one place where you can build this bridge: From the bottom left
corner, count 14 steps to the right (so the block is the 15th block to
the left). Build a bridge starting from here up to the center using all
seven blocks. You also need to use the gray square of floor there as
part of the bridge. After getting the four chips from the center island,
go to the exit square at the bottom right corner.



LEVEL 048 - MUGGER SQUARE
Password: JYSF

First, go left into a large open area and get the chip there (DO NOT get
the skates yet). Take the force floor path into the spies and get the
ice skates. Now, move on the force floors so that you enter the teleport
block through the bottom. This will bring you to the ice area. Don't get
the flippers here but get the chip on the ice. Go on the force floors
into some spies. NOW collect the flippers and move on the force floors
so that you enter the teleport block through the left side. Now you are
in the water area. Get the two chips from the water and go on the force
floors to the spy. Take the fire boots and move on the force floors so
that you enter the teleport block through the top (so you'll go to the
fire area). Watch out for the fireballs here and get the chip and the
suction boots. Wit the suction boots, you'll be able to walk around the
spies instead of getting all your stuff stolen. Go around the spies and
get the final chip. Return right to the open area and get the ice
skates. Now enter the teleport block through the bottom. Take the
flippers and go enter the teleport block through the left side (to go to
the water place). Go through the chip socket and into the exit square.



LEVEL 049 - PROBLEMS
Password: PPXI

Go left and quickly collect all 18 of the red keys here. You only have
15 seconds to do this because when you have about 185 seconds left on
the timer, the pink balls will be unleashed. After collecting all the
red keys, run to the right and take the path of red locks down. Cross
the bear trap switch and start collecting the 23 chips here. You have
all the time you need here, so take as much time as you want. When
you've collected all the chips, go to the exit square at the upper left
corner.



LEVEL 050 - DIGDIRT
Password: QBDH

In this level, you must go through the dirt and into the squares of land
where the chips are. Unfortunately, there are monsters protecting each
of the chips. The safest (but not the fastest) strategy of getting these
chips is to clear out ALL the dirt in the level except the ones touching
the squares with the chips. When that's done, go to a square and take
out one block of dirt and step back. The monster inside will get out and
you'll have time to get the chip. Repeat this step with all the squares
until you've collected all of the chips. When you have all the chips,
go into the exit square near the center of the stage.



LEVEL 051 - ISLIDE
Password: IGGJ

This level is a maze of ice with a land area in the center made of nine
blocks. First go to the upper left block and go up. When you reach a
chip, press up again to get to another chip. Now return to the center
"island" (right, down). Now stay on the upper left block and move left.
You'll arrive at a chip. Now press up to get to another chip, and press
left to return to the center island. Stand at the lower left block and
press left. When you get to the chip, go down to get to another chip.
Press down again to go back, and left to return to the island. Go to the
middle bottom block and press down. When you get to the chip, press up
for another chip. Now return to the center island (left, left). Now from
the bottom right block, press down to get another chip (4 chips left),
and left for another chip (3 chips left). Return to the center island
(up, up). Now from the bottom right block, press right to get a chip (2
chips left), down to get another chip (1 chip left), and down to get the
final chip (complete!). Return to the center island (up, right, up) and
go up from the top middle block. Go up one last time to go into the exit
square.



LEVEL 052 - THE LAST LAUGH
Password: PPHT

This is another level that I was stuck on for a while. It looks like
it's impossible to get to the upper area, and it seems like there's
nothing you can do! There's a monster in a box that toggles the doors
every time you cross the other side. Here's how to get to the top:
First, stand at the left side of the line of three force floors. When
there are no bug that could harm you below, cross the force floors until
you get to the third block of force floor, then quickly move down and
cross the force floor there back to the left side. You need to do this in
a way that the teeth in the box will step on the toggle switch but not
cross to the right side but turn back to the left side instead. If you
did this correctly, there should now be a path to the upper part on the
side where you're standing. Go up there and cross the path of recessed
walls to toggle the doors and collect the chip. Now the fireballs are
blocking the path back to the lower area. Use the block on the water
(closer to the exit square) to build a new path to the lower area. Now
go down and do that same trick with the force floors to open up the path
to the upper area. Then cross the force floors completely to the other
side and go to the upper area. Take another path of recessed walls to
toggle the doors and collect the chip. Now the fireballs are blocking
your path again! To open up the path, go further up and stand over the
middle force floor (the one over the cloning button). Don't go any
further than that! Return down to discover that the fireballs have
disappeared. This is because the teeth in the box down there stepped on
the toggle switch! Take the force floor path to the left side and go
into the exit square.



LEVEL 053 - TRAFFIC COP
Password: CGNX

This level is very easy when you learn how to do it. Follow the lower
path down to the force floor. Cross the force floor to get to the toggle
switch (this removes the toggle doors around the exit square). Now it
looks like you can't move anywhere, but actually you can 'force' your
way through the force floor by holding down. Now you can return to the
beginning and walk right into the exit square. To save even more time,
you can use a block over the water to create a shortcut to the switch.



LEVEL 054 - GRAIL
Password: ZMGC

This is a weird level and I'm not really sure if I'm doing it right.
Anyway here's how I beat this level: First, go left over the red cloning
switch. This switch clones brown blocks. You need to ride on the force
floors a bit and press down at the right time to land on the switch. Now
a block will come riding on the force floors and will hopefully come to
you. If it doesn't come to you and lands somewhere else, try again. Keep
on cloning these blocks and make a little bridge going to the red key 
and the flippers. Then swim to the island below to get the yellow key.
Force yourself against the force floors to make your way to the lower
area. Collect all 68 of the chips here. In the top right place you can
get the fire boots if you want. I'm really not sure what I did next
here: Go through some teleport blocks and *hopefully* they will lead you
to the area where the yellow lock is. So go through the yellow lock and
continue to go into the exit square [NOTE: If anyone has some clear
instructions on what to do here, please tell me!]



LEVEL 055 - POTPOURRI
Password: SJES

You'll need to be a little quick in this level because your time is
seriously limited. So... move right and push the block into the bomb so
you can collect that chip. Then go to the 'blue tank area' and be fast
to collect the fire boots and the blue key. You can't simply take that
open path to the exit square because of the invisible wall blocking your
way.  Now go down until you see a chip enclosed with blocks. Push the
brown block right to get it. Watch out for the block at your top-right,
there's a spy hiding under there (so don't push that block!). Continue
left and go into the fire place (you got the fire boots from the tank
place, right?). Collect all the chips at the other side of the fire and
remember to get the chip from under the block in the fire place. Go
through the blue lock and get all the chips from this ice area (you need
to watch out for invisible walls). From here, go up into a place with
pink balls. Get all the chips from here and get the chip behind the
blocks at the left end. If you still have a chip remaining now, look for
it under the blocks in this area. Go back to the right side and go
through the chip socket and into the exit square.



LEVEL 056 - DEEP FREEZE
Password: FCJE

Go down until you see a path of solid land at your left. Take that path
and use the second force floor you see (the one going down). This will
lead you to step on a toggle door switch. Press down again and you'll be
brought to the exit of this ice area. Continue going right into another
ice area and you'll go through a teleport. Press up to go through the
teleport again and return to your previous place. Take the path up while
avoiding the pink balls. Then go right at the gravel and go down at the
second opening you see. Again, you'll go through the teleport and
collect the chip. Return through the teleport to be brought back to
where you were before. Now go to the ice area at the top right and pick
up all the chips until the "chips remaining" is at 0. Then go to the
upper left ice area and go through the middle chip socket at the side.
This brings you to the ice skates. Return to the place where you got all
the chips and go into the exit square at the top right corner.



LEVEL 057 - STRANGE MAZE
Password: UBXU

This level is called "strange maze" because of the weird, colorful
looking walls. But actually, it's just like a normal maze. In fact, it
becomes a little easier with the different walls because you'll know
what part of the maze you're at. Simply collect all of the chips and go
to the exit square. Don't worry about the monsters because they're stuck
in bear traps.



LEVEL 058 - LOOP AROUND
Password: YBLT

When you start the level, it looks like you're in an open space. But
actually you're almost surrounded by invisible walls. First, enter the
force floor path at your direct left side (you need to go around the
invisible wall). The force floor path will bring you around the upper
left square and into a teleport. Then you will take a force floor path
around the lower left square and into another teleport. Now you're going
around the lower right square. Push against the blue blocks while you're
passing along the side. You will go through a block five squares from
the bottom. Now go around the invisible walls and get the flippers. Now
find your way into the water and pick up the chip there. Get back on the
force floor path to be brought back to the beginning. Get on the force
floors and push against the wall of the upper left square... the opening
is at the top part. You need to stop at the opening of the wall so the
ball doesn't get you. When the ball is at the right, go down and left
and escape from the path of the ball. Find a way into the pool of water
and swim in to get the two chips. Take the force floor path until you're
going around the bottom right square again. Push against the blue blocks
above you at the top side and you'll find a path. Take the path around
and push yourself into a opening at the right side. Don't touch the spy!
Go around and find the opening into the water at the left side. Swim
across and get the chips. Go out and take the force floor path back to
the beginning of the level. Get on the force floors and push against the
walls of the lower left square to find an opening. Collect all the
remaining chips from there. Now take the force floors to the bottom left
corner and go through the chip socket and into the exit square.



LEVEL 059 - HIDDEN DANGER
Password: BLDM

Start out this level by doing the obvious: Go down. You'll slide all
around the level and stop at the land on the left side. Go up until you
reach a toggle switch. This switch will toggle all the doors, therefore
releasing all the monsters. When the monsters are at the right side,
step on the toggle switch and continue on to the ice. When you reach the
red key, quickly go down and run to the left side until you see a
recessed wall. Pass through the recessed wall and get the chip. Continue
going don and getting the chips until you have 0 chips remaining. Then
go around and get the flippers, suction boots, and fire boots. Now take
the same path back to that toggle switch. Cross that switch and slide on
the ice to where the fireballs are. They are moving in a loop. Stay
above the upper right corner of their loop. When there is an opening in
their loop, go in and continue with them for a short while. As soon as
there's an open space at your right, go there. Go through the chip
socket, force floor, fire, water, and go into the exit square.



LEVEL 060 - SCOUNDREL
Password: ZYVI

A "Scoundrel" is an unprincipled, dishonorable person. And that's
exactly what Chip is in this level. I'm sure there's a correct way of
beating this level, but there's also another way that's much faster and
much easier to do. Follow these directions: 11 steps down, 2 steps
right, 6 steps down, 2 steps left, and down until you see the exit
square. The exit square is covered in force floors and in looks like
it's impossible to get in. But actually, you can push yourself right
against the 'weird looking' force floor at the side and with a little
luck you will land right in the exit square. It's that simple!



LEVEL 061 - RINK
Password: RMOW

Making directions to follow for this level would be *extremely*
difficult for me to do. So therefore I'll leave it up to you to finish
this insanely difficult level. Ha ha ha! You need to go around this
level of ice collecting the 16 chips found here. The blue blocks here
are either fake or real (obviously, they must be). I suggest you make a
map of this level and find a way to get all the chips and find a
solution. Or even better, go look at a map from Alice Voith's site
(http://www.geocities.com/~fishofgold/). I'm sure that would help. So...
Good luck!



LEVEL 062 - SLO MO
Password: TIGW

This level is like a chess board of toggle doors and normal spaces. The
toggle doors open and close automatically... probably because of some
pink ball stepping on the switch. You need to make it from the bottom
left corner (your starting point) to the right side (the exit square).
You will also need to worry about the colony of teeth infesting this
level. This is much harder than it seems because the teeth move at about
the same speed as you due, to the toggle doors blocking your way. To
outrun them, look for "hallways" that don't have any toggle doors so you
can move normally. I wouldn't worry too much about the blobs, they just
have random movements and hopefully you won't run into them... but
accidents still happen.



LEVEL 063 - BLOCK FACTORY
Password: GOHX

Like many other levels, I'm not sure if I completed this level the
"correct" way. But anyhow, this is how to beat the level: First, go up
and right to step on the cloning button at the top of the level. The
cloned block will step on another cloning button and set off a chain
reaction of block cloning (but I don't think that's important). Step on
the cloning button (at the top) again and again until the top row of ice
turns into a row of blocks. Then go around and push one of those blocks
up to the top row. Again, go around to the top row and push that block
right until it reaches the water... be sure to step on it to make it
permanent. Go back and repeat that step until you've built a bridge to
that chip. Now use the force floors to get the rest of the chips until
you have only one chip remaining. Move to the solid path at the left and
follow it to another cloning button. Cross the cloning button and get
the chip at the other side of the ice. Go around and go into the exit
square at the bottom left corner.



LEVEL 064 - SPOOKS
Password: IJPQ

This level is called "Spooks" probably because it's scary to move around
with all the teeth watching you. The only way to finish this level is
to make a path around the level without making your path touch the area
where the teeth are. If the teeth have some way to get to you... they
will. Your path can touch the teeth area *diagonally* because the teeth
still can't get to you. After you finish collecting all the chips, make
your way to the exit square at the bottom left corner.



LEVEL 065 - AMSTERDAM
Password: UPUN

This level is made up of lots of blocks of land with smaller rooms with
a chip inside. You need to push the blocks in a way that you can get
inside the room for the chip... but not push the block in a way that it
makes it impossible to reach another room. If two blocks are connected
at a passage between two rooms, it's impossible to push the blocks and
get into the next room (I hope you get the point now). A good strategy
is to try to push the blocks into the corner so that they don't bother
you anymore. Sometimes you will need to push a block into the water to
get to some areas. After getting the chips, go to the exit square at the
lower right corner.



LEVEL 066 - VICTIM
Password: ZIKZ

This level won't take you too long when you learn how to do it. First
take one step down and stay there for a while. All the teeth will gather
around you but you won't get hurt because you're protected by the
recessed wall. Do this next step quickly: Down, up, down, up, down, up,
down. That's seven moves into the teleport. While you were doing that
you also got the fire boots (you should have heard it if you have the
sound effects turned on). Now get the four chips around you, open the
toggle doors with the green switch, and get the chips outside. DO NOT
get the chips protecting you from the teeth! The rest of the chips are
enough to bring your chips remaining down to 0. When that's done, go
through the path at the top where you'll see three chip sockets. Go
through the right one (the one without a recessed wall) and into the
exit square.



LEVEL 067 - CHIPMINE
Password: GGJA

Okay... this level is composed completely of blue blocks. Among the blue
blocks there are the chips. Your mission is to move through the blue
blocks and find a path to the chips and eventually the exit square. Of
course, within the blue blocks is a maze of solid blocks which you must
figure out by yourself. Actually, this level is very basic. There's a lot
of levels with virtually the same design as this (maze of blue blocks,
you find out which are solid and which are fake). The design of this
level is so simple that it makes me wonder if anyone would ever read
this. Yeesh, I'm just wasting my time! So onward to the next level...



LEVEL 068 - EENY MINY MOE
Password: RTDI

Go right and down across the gravel. Follow the path and soon you will
come to a clone button and a block. Cross the clone button and quickly
continue on the path, and bring that block with you! When you reach the
first chip, position the block so that it forms a barrier to prevent to
paramecium from escaping (you need to put it diagonally to the chip).
When the paramecium reaches the barrier and turns around, continue
pushing the block to the next chip and make another barrier. Continue
trapping the paramecium in a smaller space until he's already trapped
against the clone machine. Collect the chips and the green key on the
way out. Return to the beginning and enter the green lock at the right.
Go into the large area with water at the bottom. Go to the left side.
Now push the first block back into the corner, push the third block back
against the wall, and push the second block to the side where the third
block was. Now go through the opening and push the third block
completely to the right side (past all the other blocks). Now use the
blocks to build bridges to the chips. Return to the beginning and enter
the green lock at the left. Get the two chips at the top and wait. When
the gliders with a large space between them come, jump down with them
and get the SECOND chip down at the left side. DO NOT get the first chip
because the gliders will go right into you. When the gliders with the
large spacing come again, quickly run into the central area with all the
bear traps. Now you should push a block into their pattern and screw
them up so that they go into the water area. When they're all gone,
collect all the chips and go into the exit square at the beginning.



LEVEL 069 - BOUNCE CITY
Password: NLLY

Watch out for the several pink balls in this stage. First, go right and
up (and keep going right and up) until you reach a place where you must
cross some VERTICAL moving pink balls. Pass by them and take the upper
path. Soon you'll come to a group of paramecium. Wait for a large
opening in their pattern and follow them. When you come to multiple
paths, split from the paramecia and take the path to the right. Go down
the path with the four pink balls going up and down through it, use the
holes in the wall to hide when they pass by. When you reach the bottom,
go up the path with four more pink balls. Continue down along the path
and collect the red and blue key. Return to the blue lock. Go through it
and pick up the blue and yellow keys. Return down and go through the
LOWER yellow lock. Get the yellow key and follow the paramecium along
the path until you reach the three locks. Go through them all and into
the exit square.



LEVEL 070 - NIGHTMARE
Password: GCCG

Start this level by following the path downwards. The teeth will follow
you as soon as the level starts, so be quick. Soon you will pass a bear
trap switch. This releases the bear trap holding the bug, and that bug
will start to chase you (he'll drown when he gets to the water). Then
you'll pass by another bear trap switch that releases a fireball and it
will start chasing you. Hit the toggle door switch as soon as you reach
it to trap the fireball behind you. But another toggle door will open
and release a glider! Let him go ahead a little and push the block down
to form a bridge.. cross the gravel to escape that glider. Now you'll
have to step on a bear trap switch that releases a paramecium. Continue
on the path and push the block two spaces down. Go around and trap the
paramecium when he goes in. [NOTE: If you have the Lynx version of the
game, you'll step on a switch that releases another paramecium. This
doesn't happen in the windows version.] Continue on the path and a teeth
will start to follow you. Get the yellow key and continue right. Make
your way past the pink ball by using the aclove in the wall (don't step
on the blue button). Continue along the path. After crossing the gravel,
you will need to step on yet another bear trap switch that releases the
glider and he will, of course, chase you. Go through the yellow lock
(hopefully the blob won't bother you) and continue until you reach a
blue switch. LISTEN CLOSELY: Step on the blue switch, step down, and go
up to step on the blue switch again before the tank goes right off the
screen. Cross the other blue switch and hurry to the block. Hit the
block up and QUICKLY move to the right to avoid getting hit by it (and
killed). Continue doing this to the rest of the blocks so you can get to
the top. Now push the top two blocks LEFT into the water... also step on
them to make them solid (form a path to the red lock). Go up and step on
the bear trap switch, then quickly hide in the aclove below. Wait for
the fireball to go up past the force floors. Continue up past the force
floor and go to the block. Step on the block to make him solid and move
away to let the bug go into the water. Get the red key and go down on
the path. Push the block into the bear trap switch. This will release
SEVERAL bugs... so be VERY fast and go down past the gravel (you're safe
now). Step on the right force floor to bring you to the path you made to
the red lock. Go past the red lock and follow the path into the exit
square to FINALLY end your nightmare... that was the longest level
solution so far!



LEVEL 071 - CORRIDOR
Password: LAJM

First push the block down into the water and get the red key. Go through
the lock at the left, get the chip, and push the top block to the left
(against the chip). Now inside the little square, push the top block
down once and get the two chips. Push it down again, push the other two
blocks to the side (one square), and get the two chips. Now push aside
the block that you've been pushing down (push it into the corner).
Circle around and push the middle block into the center of the square.
You can now push those two blocks into the water. Feel free to do as
much circling around as you need. When that's done you can get the red
key and enter the right lock. Do the same thing here that you did to the
other side (also push the two blocks into the water). You can now get
the green key, the four chips around the water, and the blue key. Go
back to the left square area and use the blue chip on the lock. Go up
and get the chip and the yellow key. Go to the right square area and go
through the lock to get the chip and red key. Continue exchanging
between left and right areas to use the keys until all locks are cleared
and you have the yellow and green keys. Now push ALL the remaining six
blocks into the water (excluding the ones you pushed into the corner).
Also collect the chips at the side of this "corridor" you're building.
You should have 0 chips remaining when you reach the end. Go through the
green lock and through one of the red locks. Watch out for the walker
and get the blue key. Now you can go through the blue lock and into the
exit square.



LEVEL 072 - REVERSE ALLEY
Password: EKFT

In this level you must go through the alley while collecting the chips
and avoiding the tanks. It's a very straight forward level and you
should get it on your first or second try. It helps to have sound
effects turned on her so you can get a rhythm of the tanks movements.
In case you're wondering, there's a paramecium going around the outsides
that's causing the tanks to move back and fourth when it passes on the
blue tank buttons. This level is not timed so you an take as much time
as you want. I think that's all I need to say for this level. Next...



LEVEL 073 - MORTON
Password: QCCR

This is a terribly difficult level. One of the hardest levels in the
game. At first this looks like a regular maze where you get the chips
and go to the exit square. But things are much more complicated because
of the teeth at the center of the maze. You need to get all of the chips
and trick him to coming out of the center... and getting himself trapped
so that he doesn't get you. This maze is full of invisible dead ends. It
might help to make a map of this level and design a plan of how to get
all the chips and trick the teeth into getting stuck somewhere.



LEVEL 074 - PLAYTIME
Password: MKNH

First, go up past the clone button and slide left on the ice. The ice
will bring you around the level and you will stop on a bear trap switch.
Take one step right into the bear trap. When the pink ball comes and
hits the bear trap switch, press up to slide up into the ice. Doing this
requires exact timing when the pink ball steps on the switch. You will
slide onto the land where some bugs are going around. Go down and get
the chip, then return back up. Slide onto the ice at the upper part so
the force floor will push you up to a new area. Now take 2 steps left
and 6 steps down. Step left onto the force floors and they will bring
you to the chip. Get out of the force floors. Get the chip from the area
with pink balls and tanks... then get out of there. Push the two blocks
into the water to form a bridge to the chip. After getting the chip,
quickly get out of the area to avoid getting killed by those gliders.
You should now have all the chips you need. Go into the exit square at
the upper right corner.



LEVEL 075 - STEAM
Password: MJDV

This level is called "Steam" because steam is produced when the fire
goes into the water. You need to get the fire boots and the flippers in
the correct order so that you can progress through this level. Touching
the spies in unavoidable... and you *need* to touch them to beat this
level. Follow these directions: 1U 1L 1D 4L 1U 2L 1D 3L 2U 1L 2U 1R 1U
2R 1D 2R 2U 1R 1U 2R 3U 1R 3U 3L 3U 4L 2U 6L 1D 4L 4D 1L 1D 2L 7D 2L 2D
1R 3D 1L. Great! Now you have both the fire boots AND the flippers! Now
you can easily avoid the spies and go to the exit square at the upper
left corner.



LEVEL 076 - FOUR PLEX
Password: NMRH

First, go right. You will slide around and go through some teleports.
When you stop, step right, down, and go right (through the blue wall).
Follow the path and go through the last blue block. Go up to get the red
key. Now return to the teleport. Go down through the blue block, the
recessed wall, and the red lock and get the blue key. Now go through the
teleport block 3 times through the side. Get the yellow key. Enter the
teleport three more times (through the side) and go through the yellow
lock. Now you are out of the ice area. Follow the path until you get to
a clone button. This button makes a pink ball appear behind you... so
step on the switch and quickly step to the side. Next you need the
quickly get the chip, then go up to the safe place without getting hurt
by the pink ball. After doing that, the pink ball will go into the
water. Do the same thing to the other pink ball. Then go on the lower
force floor path and get the chip. Move right again and quickly move
DOWN to avoid the moving block. Push that brown block into the bomb at
the right. Go through the bug place and return to the lower force
floors. This time, move UP after hitting the block. Now push that block
down and into the bombs at the right. Return to the UPPER force floors
and push two more of the blocks into the bombs (one by one, from bottom
to top). You don't need to do the top one. Follow the path (that used to
be inhabited by bombs) and go up the force floors. Your next challenge
is to use the gliders to hit the bombs. This shouldn't be too hard since
they stop at every bear trap for you to set the toggle doors correctly.
Get all the chips behind the bombs. You should now have 11 chips
remaining. Go into the recessed walls area and get the chips there...
then go to the next area (with locks and stuff). Get the blue and yellow
keys. Get the fire boots from behind the yellow lock, get the red key
from behind the blue lock, get the yellow key from behind the red lock,
and the flippers from behind the yellow lock. Get the final two chips,
through the chip socket, and FINALLY into the exit square.



LEVEL 077 - INVINCIBLE CHAMPION
Password: FHIC

In this level you must follow the path of the bees to get the five
chips. But there's one bee in the area that's going the opposite
direction than the rest of the bees. You need to give him a path leading
him away from the rest of the bees through an opening at the top right.
When he goes away, you can follow the bees around to collect the five
chips. Then enter the exit square somewhere near the top left.
[NOTE: DO NOT clear a path going to the clone button. A glider is
somewhere in this level and he will clone more gliders if he reaches
that button. And the cloned gliders will clone more gliders... it's a
chain reaction!]



LEVEL 078 - FORCE SQUARE
Password: GRMO

When you are in the force floor area, you can only move one square at a
time. You can't trick the force floors and try going in the opposite
direction. Just look at the direction of the force floors and find a
path to the chips. It's really not that hard. In case you get stuck, go
through an opening at the left side and enter the teleports. Try going
through different directions to get to different areas of the force
floor maze. When you have collected all the chips, go out through the
opening at the left and use the keys to reach the exit square..........
And for all you lazy people, here's a detailed walkthrough: R U R U U L
D L U R D D D D D D L L L L L L U U U R U L U R U L D R D L D R R U U U.
Now go out through the opening at the left, enter the teleport, and
enter the teleport again from the top. D R. Go out through the opening
at the left, enter the teleport, and enter the teleport again through
the top. D L. Now you have all the chips! Exit through the left, enter
the teleport, get the yellow key (if you didn't get it before), enter
the teleport through the left, enter the teleport again, get the red
key. Enter the teleport a few more times, go through the yellow and red
locks, into the exit square.



LEVEL 079 - DRAWN AND QUARTERED
Password: JINU

This level is composed of four areas. You start the level in the lower
right area. First, collect all the chips in their little "rooms" along
the sides. When all the chips are collected in this area, enter the
teleport through the right. Now you are in the lower left area. While
collecting the chips in this area, try not to break the position of the
fireballs. Just keep them going around in the same rectangular loop.
Just remember their pattern: They go forward and turn right when they
meet an obstacle. When all the chips are collected in this area, enter
the teleport through the bottom. Now you are in the upper right area.
Again, collect all the chips here without disrupting the pattern of the
fireballs. Go through the teleport through the top. You are now in the
upper left area. This time, you'll need to disturb the pattern of the
fireballs a little. But make sure they don't go into the teleport (that
would just confuse everything). After getting all the chips, enter the
exit square at the bottom right corner (of this section).



LEVEL 080 - VANISHING ACT
Password: EVUG

Ohhh... this level is evil. It's actually a maze where the walls are
made of *invisible* blocks! These invisible blocks are located at the
parts of solid land at the beginning. The parts that are dirt blocks at
the beginning are just open spaces. But as you continue through this
maze collecting chips, the dirt path will disappear and look just like
the walls. Unfortunately, the only way I was able to solve this level
was by making a map. So that's what I suggest you do. With a map this
level is sooooo much easier. I hope that helps :P  When you finish
collecting all the chips, go into the exit square at the bottom right
corner.



LEVEL 081 - WRITER'S BLOCK
Password: SCWF

Ladies and gentlemen, this is a hard level. Well, not really too hard.
But it's a LONG level! You need to use every block to build little
bridges to each of the chips. If you make one mistake, you'll need to
start over. The blocks are arranged in the giant word "THANKS". You can
take as much time as you want in this level because it isn't timed. To
reach the blocks in the corners, you need to use more than one block.
The three blocks that compose the cross of the "T" are along the water.
Push the middle block into the water so you can use the other two
blocks.



LEVEL 082 - SOCIALIST ACTION
Password: LLIO

First, go up five steps and push the block at your left into the wall.
Then push the block at your right into the opening where the bugs come
through (put it beside the upper block) so that they have to go around.
Now do you see the little wall thing of two blocks (right above you)?
Stand at the right side of the upper block. [NOTE: In case you didn't
understand the above instructions, follow these directions from the
start: U5 L2 4R 1U 2L 1D 1L 2U 2R 3U] Now follow these directions:
7U 12L D1 12L D4. You are now in the gravel area... safe from the bugs.
Go down and there should be a teeth monster watching you. Stand beside
the water so that he'll dive in. Next, go down into the corner and wait.
Soon a teeth will come running to you. When he's about two or three
blocks away, step up so he'll also go into the water. Stay on the gravel
and a bug will soon come and kill himself in the water. All you have to
do now is take the long path around the bottom of the level and into the
exit square.



LEVEL 083 - UP THE BLOCK
Password: OVPJ

The first thing you need to do is bring the block to the glider area. So
go 4D 2R and take the path upwards until you reach the block. Push the
block to just under the force floor. Now go to the glider area and go
through the path at the top. Go down the first force floor to push the
block downwards. Next, push the block to the far right path (without a
force floor) and down to the bottom. Again, take the path above the
glider area... but go PAST the first force floor and push the block into
the glider area. You need to use the block to make the gliders hit the
bombs at the bottom. When all the gliders are done, use the block to hit
the last bomb. Now you can start collecting chips! You can start with
the little glider area at the left, there's two chips at the top. Get
out of there and collect six more chips in little triangle compartments. 
When you only have 6 chips left, it's time to enter the large glider
area. You need to send the gliders flying into the bombs at the
center... so take the block from the side and bring it into the glider
area through the right side. You only need TWO gliders to hit the bombs.
Collect the chips and the center of the bombs and return to the first
glider area. Go through the chip socket at the top and into the exit
square.



LEVEL 084 - WARS
Password: UVEO

Go left and push the block 15 spaces to the left (in other words, take
16 steps left at the start). Now push the block up until it's disrupting
the pattern of the bugs. The block should be touching the corner of the
wall there. Doing this disturbs the pattern of the bugs and creates a
little space between them for you. So get in that space and follow the
bugs around while collecting the chips. When you've collected all the
chips you need (only 5), exit from the bee path through the bottom left
corner. Circle around this wall to the exit square at the upper left.



LEVEL 085 - TELENET
Password: LEBX

First, make your way to the bottom left to get the blue key (15L 14D 7L
13D 7L 7U). Then enter the blue lock at the bottom right to enter the
"telenet". You need to travel from one block to the next collecting the
chips and avoiding getting hit by the fireballs. All the fireballs in
the level travel at about the same direction. I mean, when a fireball is
at the top of a block, all the rest of the fireballs are also at the top
of the block. They're all at about the same position of the block and
travelling at the same speed. So if a fireball is at the top of the
block, go DOWN through the teleport so the next fireball won't hit you.
When you have all the chips, exit the telenet. Go through the chip
socket and continue into the exit square.



LEVEL 086 - SUICIDE
Password: FLHH

First, go left and push the block until it's two spaces away from the
left wall (23L). Then push the block down until it's two spaces away
from the bottom wall (there's only one space between the block and the
wall). There's a pink ball bouncing up and down along the left side
wall. When that pink ball reaches the corner, push the block left to
trap it there. Now stay at the right (below the bombs) and wait. Gliders
will soon be coming one by one to hit the bombs. While they're doing
this, try to stay in a safe place (like between some walls) so that the
gliders don't get you. When all the bombs are gone, go right into the
exit square.



LEVEL 087 - CITYBLOCK
Password: YJYS

This is a very time consuming level. First, go up to the place where
chips are being covered by walls of three brown blocks. You need to push
back the blocks at the left and the right and push the middle block to
the side to get the chip (you'll need to toggle the doors a few times).
Next you need to get the chip's from behind the two big pyramids of
blocks. Do some careful block pushing and toggling to get those chips.
When that's done, the next thing to do is get the chips in those two
triangles of blocks and toggle doors. Then use the blocks to build a</pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
bridge on the water at the left. You should build a bridge along the
right and the bottom TWO blocks wide. Then build a little bridge along
the top and the left only ONE block wide. You'll also need to use the
blocks from the triangles. The blocks from the upper left area should be
enough... After that, continue to the lower left area by taking the path
of ice. Go left and push the block on to the ice and step DOWN quickly
because the block is coming back. Now push the block UP and get the chip
at the left. Continue pushing the block up across all the force floors
until it reaches the path you were building before (also collect the
other chips at the left). Push that block into the water. Now you need
to collect the chips at the right side. To do this, push the bottom
right block ONE space to the RIGHT. Now circle around to the top right
force floor and take the path down while collecting the chips at the
right side. When you reach the bottom, you'll push the block one space
down forming a path for you to get out. Don't push that block down again
because it will bounce back to you! Now go to the chip socket. From the
space at the left of the chip socket, follow these directions: 5R 1D 2R
1U 3R 1D 3R 1U 1R 3D 1L 5D 1R 3D 2U 2L 1D 1R 3D 1U 1R 1D 1R 1U 1R 1D 1R.



LEVEL 088 - SPIRALS
Password: WZYV

There are two versions of this level for different versions of the game.
Here's the solution for the normal version: Take the path and go DOWN at
the first chip, DOWN at the second chip, LEFT at the third chip, RIGHT
at the fourth chip, DOWN at the crossing, DOWN at the fifth chip, LEFT
at the sixth chip, UP at the seventh chip, UP at the eight chip, LEFT at
the ninth chip, DOWN at the tenth chip, DOWN at the eleventh chip, go
down at the crossing, LEFT at the 12th chip, and into the exit
square.

Here's the solution for the second version of the level: Take the path
and go DOWN at the first chip, DOWN at the second chip, DOWN at the
third chip, UP at the fourth chip, DOWN at the fifth chip, LEFT at the
sixth chip, RIGHT at the seventh chip, RIGHT at the eighth chip, DOWN at
the ninth chip, RIGHT at the tenth chip, go LEFT at the crossing, LEFT
at the eleventh chip, LEFT at the 12th chip, and into the exit
square.



LEVEL 089 - BLOCK BUSTER
Password: VCZO

Go up to the first clone button to make a block. Push the block aside
and move down to avoid getting hurt. Now go up and step on the
upper-right clone button. Circle around and push the block upwards. Do
it again to complete the path and get the red key. Return to the
original first block you made. Push it up twice and go up to stomp on
it. Make more blocks with the bottom-left clone button and push them up
until you've formed a complete path to the green key at the left. Then
go down and through the green lock... get the chip... through the next
green and red locks. Get the chip and follow the path until you reach
some clone buttons. Run across all the clone buttons and you will need
to follow the path *through the ice* while avoiding the moving blocks.
Then you will need to go down through the ice while avoiding the blocks
again. Be careful not to push any blocks! Continue following the path
and soon you will have to face more blocks. This time it's MUCH HARDER.
Those blocks have a pattern and you will need to have a quick mind to
follow the pattern and get past the blocks. [NOTE: It might help you
here to have color, sound effects, background music, and as much
programs as possible open to try to slow your computer down a bit.].
Getting past these blocks requires some really good luck :)  After that,
continue following the path... until the exit square.



LEVEL 090 - PLAYHOUSE
Password: OLLM

Use the blocks to build a path to the force floors. Don't use the upper
right block because it has fire under it. Ride the force floors and go
right. Find the path in the triangle of blue blocks... then get the
yellow key and chips. Now return to the part where the force floors
brought you. You need to push the blocks into the water to form a path
2 blocks thick. To do this: Push the two middle blocks forward, push
the two outside blocks forward, push the remaining blocks to the center,
and push them forward. Cross your path (touch only one recessed wall)
and go through the yellow lock to collect the chips and a blue key. Now
go out of this area through your path. Go a little to the right and find
the opening in the wall of blue blocks below you. Go right and cross the
ice for some chips, then go all the way to the left and go through the
blue lock. Slide down the ice path. Get the nine chips and the green key
at the top. There is NO WAY to get the ice boots and the chip (you don't
need them anyway). Slide back on the ice path and get out of the pink
ball area. Go to your far left and up through the green lock. Push the
first block all the way to the left (aligned with the other block) and
use the blocks to cross the water. Get all those chips that spell "GOOD
LUCK". Then go past the fire (you have the fire boots) to get even more
chips. Go through the green lock that leads to the chips (not to the
pink balls) and collect the remaining chips you need. Go through the
chip sockets and into the exit square.



LEVEL 091 - JUMPING SWARM
Password: JPQG

This level is very difficult. You need to collect all the chips from
this level while avoiding the walkers. The walkers are constantly being
cloned, so there would be a lot of them after just a few seconds.
Therefore you need to move hella fast so you can collect the chips
without too much walkers bothering you. After collecting the chips, exit
through the exit square at the bottom right corner. Good luck, young
chipster. And may the force be with you.



LEVEL 092 - VORTEX
Password: DTMI

Follow these directions at the very start: 1L 2U 2R 1D 1R 3D 5L 2U 2L 3D
4L 1U 2L 3U 2R 2U 5R 1U 2R 1U 1R 4U 1R 5U 1L 5U. Now there is a walker
at the space to your right and there is a fireball at your upper-right.
Clear the blue block at the bottom of the walker's area to free him (be
careful not to get hurt). Then go up to the fireball area and get the
blue key from there, careful not to get hit by the fireball. Now get out
of this monster place! Find your way to the green key and pick it up
(behind the recessed wall). Continue forward and circle around with the
fireballs. Get the chip when you reach it, then go deeper and deeper
into the center of this place while collecting the chips. You will reach
a teleport at the center- go DOWN through it to get a chip. Go back
through the teleport make your way to the outer ring of fireballs.
Collect that chip at the bottom, through the blue lock and chip
socket... finished!



LEVEL 093 - ROADSIGN
Password: REKF

At the start, follow these directions: 3L 1D 1L 3D 4L 1U 1L 2U 1L 2U 1R
3D 1L 1D 8R 7L 2U 1R 1D 3R 2U 1L 2D 2U 1R 2D 2L 3D 4R 1L 3U 2R 9D 4U 2L

1D 2L 2U 5R 3L 2D 4R 5U. Push this block straight up into the water.
Circle around to the blocks and push them into the two bombs to get the
chip. Go around to the top and hit the toggle switch in a way to trap all
the balls (except for the middle one). Get the chip there. Now use the
two remaining blocks in this level to finish building the bridge across
the water and get the final chip. Return to the center and get in the
damn exit square.



LEVEL 094 - NOW YOU SEE IT
Password: EWCS

In this level, you need to find a path to the chips in an environment of
invisible walls. You know the pattern for beating levels like this. It's
amazingly similar to Level 030 (Mishmesh) and Level 067 (Chipmine) that
I shouldn't even have to write a solution for this level. Simply feel
around for the walls and you should have most of the maze cleared after
a few minutes. Yeah, I know it can be really annoying always bumping
into walls... but be patient and have faith. The exit square is located
somewhere at the bottom left.



LEVEL 095 - FOUR SQUARE
Password: BIFQ

Before we begin, a few terms to remember. The area that you start the
level in will be referred to as "Area 1". The area you get to when
passing through the teleport is "Area 2". Okay. So first, enter the
teleport from the left (traveling to the right) to get to Area 2 and
push the block right against the blue lock. Get the red key at the top
right (don't enter any locks unless I tell you to). Work your way
clockwise and push the four blocks into the teleport and follow them to
push them into the water. When that's done, there should only be one
block of water in area 1. Get the other red key from the bottom left of
area 2. Return to area 1 and get the green key from behind the red lock
(at the top right). Enter the green lock at the top right and take the
force floor path (collecting a chip along the way). When you reach solid
land, pray that you don't hit a walker and continue going up through the
red lock (if you're still alive). Next, you need to get a chip from the
walker area below you. Then go through the teleport to return to area 1.
Enter the green lock at the bottom right and go in the exit square.



LEVEL 096 - PARANOIA
Password: BIFQ

At the beginning, the blue tank right below you will move to the right.
Quickly go down and right and get one or two chips (stay in the chip
compartment). When the blue tank goes back to the left, get the
remaining chips and the blue key. Step on the blue switch and move to a
chip compartment. When the tank is at your right, go to the left and
down. Enter the blue lock. Get all the chips here and listen closely:
Step on the blue switch and watch the tank at the top. When the tank
hits the blue button, step on your blue button again. If you got the
timing right, the upper blue tank will just stay there at the right. Now
you can get the fireboots and red key at the right. Step on the blue
switch and get to the left and down through the red lock. Continue on
the path until you get to a recessed wall. To get past the bugs, just
follow them clockwise around the edges and go down past more recessed
walls. When you get to the pink balls, wait until it's safe before you
get the chip and continue downwards. When you finish with the pink
balls, you should have only 34 chips left. Now in the paramecium place,
go to the center and collect all four chips here (remember that you have
the fire boots). Take the exit at the top right and take the ice path.
More pink balls! Get all the chips here (one side at a time). Take the
path at the left to get the red key. Then take the right path to go
through the red lock and reach the fire place. Collect all the chips
here. Be careful about the INVISIBLE WALL at the middle, it can trap you
and you could get killed by the bugs. Go along the outside edges and
through the fire to collect the chips. Then take the exit at the top
right. Continue on the path until you reach the exit square.



LEVEL 097 - METASTABLE TO CHAOS
Password: IOCS

This is an interesting level. You need to push blocks into the group of
bugs to mess up their pattern. Once their pattern is destroyed, all hell
breaks loose and the bugs start panicking (running around in random
directions). If a bug starts chasing you, RUN away through the dirt path
and try to lose him. I usually push a block into the bottom right of the
bugs and there's a path going along the right to the exit square.
Anyhow, try different things if that doesn't work for you (actually, I
wasn't able to do this level when I tried again).



LEVEL 098 - SHRINKING
Password: TKWD

This level is composed of 9 separate squares. You start this level in
the center square, and end it at the exit square at the top right
square. All the other 7 squares contain a chip, you need to get all of
them. All of the squares have pink balls guarding the outside border...
to beat these squares, look for the space in between these balls for you
to enter the square. In some places, it seems like there are so many balls
that it's impossible to get into the square (this is especially true to
the squares at the top). You can try pushing in brown blocks to mess up
the pattern of the balls. For the last square (top right), you *need* to
push a block in (at the force floors) so make a space for you.



LEVEL 099 - CATACOMBS
Password: XUVU

Go up past the clone buttons until you reach as high as you can go. Push
the block down into the water and get the blue key. Also push the next
block down to the tanks to get the flippers (hidden under the block). Go
across the water to the right, collect the chip, and enter the blue
lock. Get the three yellow keys [NOTE: This room will be called the "main
room"]. Enter the yellow lock at the right and collect the two chips and
the red key (don't go through any of the red locks here in this room).
Go back to the main room and enter the yellow lock at the top. Get the
red key and push the block to the right. Collect two more yellow keys.
Open the red lock above you and get the two chips inside. Return to the
main room. Go through the red lock at the bottom and get the red key.
Push the block to the right and get the two yellow keys. Enter the red
lock below you, get two chips. Okay, now find a yellow lock and get all
the chips inside. Then find another red lock and get all the chips
inside. Go through a green lock, and a blue lock, get the final chip, and
go right into the exit square.



LEVEL 100 - COLONY
Password: QJXR

Welcome to Level 100! This isn't a particularly difficult level... it's
actually pretty easy. All you have to do is go around the place
collecting chips and avoiding the monsters. Remember, all of these
monsters have a fixed path: All fireballs go clockwise, all gliders go
counter clockwise. You need to collect a total of 48 chips. In some
parts, the area is smaller and there is no safe center area. For these
parts, follow the monster around when it's safe and move to the next
square. When you're done collecting all the chips, go to the exit square
at the bottom left corner.



LEVEL 101 - APARTMENT
Password: RPIR

This level isn't too hard. You need to go to all the "rooms" and collect
chips. Make sure you get *every* chip in the room when you're there. You
will usually get only one chance to visit each room since most rooms
have three "doors" to it (1 to come in, 1 to come out, 1 to come back in
and get stuck). If you really need it, here's the directions: 2D 2R 4U
1R 1U 1D 4L 1D 2U 1R 3U 1L 3U 1R 3U 1L 3U 1R 3U 1L 3U 1R 3U 1L 2U 2R 2L

LEVEL 102 - ICEHOUSE
Password: VDDU

At first, press up so you won't enter the teleport yet. A glider will
soon come to you from the left. When he's three spaces away from you,
press right to enter the teleport [NOTE: You need to be EXACTLY three
spaces apart from the glider]. Slide around on the ice until you get to
a clone button. At the EXACT moment you get there, press right to move
the block one space right and block the teeth. Pause for a while-- if
you got the timing right, the three teeth will be trapped in the place
below the block. Go to the left area and get the fireboots, red key, and
two chips. Go to the right and stay at the space just to the right of
the brown block. Now run to the right and past the recessed wall. Get
the flippers, yellow key, and chip behind the red lock. Get out of there
by sliding across the ice at the bottom. Go left and down into the fire/
water. Continue left through the yellow lock leading to the two spies.
Go through the bottom spy to get the force floor boots. Continue on the
path and slide across the ice to get to the exit square.



LEVEL 103 - MEMORY
Password: PTAC

Obviously, you need to go around the level collecting chips. To access
different parts of the level, step on the blue switches (to move the
tanks) and the green switches (to toggle the toggle doors). You'll need
to do this a lot at the correct places to get to the places with chips.
If you ever seem to be stuck, try different things and see what happens.
I was able to beat this level on my first try... but I was never able to
do it after that :)  The exit square can be found at the top left.



LEVEL 104 - JAILER
Password: KWNL

The principle behind this level is very simple- Collect all the keys, go
through the locks, collect all the chips, and into the exit square. It
seems like this level is very easy, but I always seem to get hit by the
pink balls at some point. Here's a good strategy: First, collect all
four chips while avoiding the pink balls. Then go through all the paths
in clockwise order starting from the bottom. This way you will know
which paths you didn't take yet. Be sure to collect all the chips. When
avoiding the pink balls, be very careful about balls that bounce into
other balls. When the chip counter reaches 0, go into the exit square at
the bottom path.



LEVEL 105 - SHORT CIRCUIT

LEVEL 106 - KABLAM
Password: NXYB

In this level, you need to use the fireballs to clear the bombs for you.
You also need to use the blocks change the directions of the fireballs
and make them clear a path to the exit square. It's probably a good idea
to keep sound effects turned on in this level so you can hear the bombs
exploding (or if the bombs are exploding at all). Remember the movement
pattern of the fireballs: They go forward and turn to their right at a
wall. If you want the spoiler solution, here it is: First let the
fireballs destroy 12 bombs (listen for the explosion)-- then follow the
path made by the fireballs up to the place with 2 brown blocks. Push the
first block 2 spaces left and push the second block 1 space down. Wait
for the fireballs to destroy 7 bombs-- then follow the path made by the
fireballs. Push the brown block 2 spaces to the left and wait for the
fireballs to destroy 12 more bombs. Then follow the path made by the
fireballs. Push the block 1 space up and wait for the fireballs to
destroy 7 bombs-- then follow the path made by the fireballs. Push the
right block one space down and wait for the fireballs to destroy 13
bombs. Follow the path down to the bottom and enter the exit square at
the left (heh, "enter the exit square"...how awkward sounding).



LEVEL 107 - BALLS O FIRE
Password: ECRE

Go through the blue wall directly at your left and follow the fireballs
around to the chip at the bottom. The when it's safe, go down five
steps, pushing the block down with you. You will also have gotten the
fireboots. Go to the left and get the wall of chips there. Go back to
the block, push it left until it's over the water, and push it down into
the water. Get the blue key at the bottom left corner. Now get all the
chips down here (they spell out "CHIP", now isn't that nifty?). Get the
yellow chip at the bottom right. Push the right block into the water and
cross up to get the remaining seven chips. Return down and all the way
left to the other block. Bring it up into the ball area (not into the
water). Open up the left yellow door and enter the fire area, bringing
the block with you. Try NOT to get into a position that you can't bring
the block with you anymore. Push the block into the water when you
arrive at it. Continue into the exit square.



LEVEL 108 - BLOCK OUT
Password: LIOC

First, take the path all the way around until you reach a square of
blocks. Push the right block to the left and push the bottom right block
down and get the red key. The go to the ice at the lower right of that
square of blocks and slide to the flippers. Slide back. Now you need to
make your way across the line of balls... shouldn't be too hard. Go
through the red lock at the upper left, go down to get the blue key.
Return to the pink ball place and enter the blue lock at the bottom
left corner (you should have seen it while getting the blue key). When
it's safe move the block (at the left) down two spaces, then get the
chip at the left. From there, go down directly, pushing the block into
the water. You can swim the rest of the way down (you have the flippers,
remember?). Get the blue key and the three chips. To get the chips in
this pink ball area, you need to get a block from the square of blocks
and use it to trap the pink ball on one side while you get the chip at
the other side. At the end (you should have 20 chips remaining), go into
the blue lock at the bottom right. Slide to the next area. Get across
this set of balls. In the next pink ball area, get all the chips and
move only to the next area while the ball is at the opposite side from
you. Enter the exit square at the bottom.



LEVEL 109 - TORTURECHAMBER
Password: KZQR

Go right and follow the fireballs and gliders around. Cross the ice at
the right to get a chip... then return to the start. Cross the force
floors by going down-up-down-up. Collect the two chips. Push the block
down and quickly follow down to push it into the bear trap. Step on the
switch to free the block. Push that block into the bomb to get rid of
it. Stay at the corner of the gravel (beside the monsters) and follow
these directions: Just after you see the fireball pass by you, quickly
go left-down-left to get the chip. At your left the fireball and glider
will be aligned every second. Right after they align, go left-left-down-
down to arrive at safe ground. Go through the chip socket and continue
on to the exit square.



LEVEL 110 - CHILLER
Password: XBAO

Go up and push the left block to the left. Then push the middle of the
three blocks to the right. Push the top of the three blocks three spaces
up. Push the bottom of the three blocks down and use it to make a bridge
over the water at the bottom left. Get past those pink balls and get the
four chips at the bottom area... also get the blue key at the end of the
force floors. Return to the pink ball place and go through the blue
lock to collect two more chips. Return to the start area and use the
five blocks to build a wall beside the ice at the right (you need to do
quite a bit of circling around to access all of the blocks; don't push
the blocks into the ice yet). Next, push the top block into the ice,
follow it to get a chip, and continue downwards to get another chip.
Return to the mainland and push the second block (from the top) into the
ice, follow it to get a chip, and continue down to get another chip.
Return and push the middle block into the ice, follow it to get a chip,
and move UP to get another chip. Push the fourth block into the ice,
follow it to get a chip, and move UP to get another chip (DO NOT move
right unless you want to die). Push the last block into the ice, follow
it for the chip, and continue up to get the final chip. Head for the
exit square at the left of the start.



LEVEL 111 - TIME LAPSE
Password: KRQJ

This level has a lot of weird stuff that's probably just trying to
confuse you. But in fact, the best solution to this level is actually
the simplest one. First, push some blocks down across the ice and into
the bombs until they're all gone. Then get all the four chips from the
bottom part of the level (2 at the left, 2 at the right). And get into
the exit square at the middle bottom. Whoa, that was easy. Onward...



LEVEL 112 - FOURTUNE FAVORS THE
Password: NJLA

First, go up eight squares. Push the block left (completely through the
wall of fireballs) until it's one square away from the wall. Then push
it nine spaces up so that it's touching the end of the wall at the
right. The rest of this level has to be done quickly: Now go around and
get the four chips inside the little cage of blocks. Go around again to
the block, push it up, and get into the exit square.



LEVEL 113 - OPEN QUESTION
Password: PTAS

Above you there is a little river and a wall of blue blocks above it.
The open block is the one eight blocks from the left. So get two brown
blocks and use them to form a bridge to the eighth block to the left.
Open the blue block. Now return to the start and get another brown
block. Bring it across the bridge until it's blocking the fireballs.
When the time is right, push the block all the way up. Use it to trap
the first pink ball against the wall. This way you can get into the
"pink ball area". Now you will need to get the five chips from here.
Try to anticipate the movement of the pink ball before you move so you
won't get hurt by them. After getting all five chips, return to the
start and go into the exit square.



LEVEL 114 - DECEPTION
Password: JWNL

First, go "4D 1L" and wait there. When the paramecium passes by and
kills himself in the fire, go down to the fireball place and collect the
three chips at the left side. Now the fireballs have separated: One
fireball at the top, one fireball at the bottom. Out of the four chips
at the right, collect the third one from the top. It's surrounded by
recessed walls, blocking you from getting to the other chips. Now get
the top-most chip protected by the fireball and hide at the space at the
bottom left of the chip (the fireball doesn't go here). Again, this chip
is surrounded by recessed walls. Go to the top area and through the
recessed wall. Get the 5 chips here (don't go through any ressessed walls
yet). Now go on the ice path (going through a recessed wall and getting
a chip along the way). Now there is a wall dividing you and the teeth.
You need to trick him in order to collect both the yellow key and the
last chip. The bast way to do this is to trap him at the right side of
the right wall and easily collect the stuff. Now go through the recessed
wall at the top right, through the yellow lock and into the exit square.



LEVEL 115 - OVERSEA DELIVERY
Password: EGRW

Go right and follow the path to the bottom right where there are four
blocks gathered around a teleport. Push one block into the teleport and
enter the teleport through a different direction (it's very important
that you go through a different direction so that you don't push the
block). You need to do this eight times. Then, you need to push the
block into the teleport in the correct direction so it doesn't get
stuck: R, U, D, U, L, R, D. At the last one, follow the block down into
the teleport so that you push it down and into the water. Go into the
teleport to return to the other blocks. Repeat the same process with the
four other blocks. At the last move, push the block into the water so
that you'd be building a bridge to the exit square.



LEVEL 116 - BLOCK BUSTER II
Password: HXMF

First, step on all the red buttons starting from the top right going
down to the bottom left. Then push all the blocks up into the water and
get the chips and the green key. Also get the chips along the left side.
Then go down and go through the two green locks at the bottom left.
Follow the path until you get to a big X of clone buttons. Step on the
bottom left button, this makes a block appear at the bottom right. Go to
the bottom right and push the middle block up into the water, follow it
and collect the chips. Step on the bottom left button again and push the
middle block up again, and do it again so that the block bounces back to
you (move to the side and avoid it). Push that block to the left hand
side and use it to cover up two paths of water at the top. Continue
doing this and covering up the water until you can get all the chips and
the blue key. Then go through the blue lock, through the chip socket,
and into the exit square.



LEVEL 117 - THE MARSH
Password: FPZT

You need to push the blocks into the water to build a path to the exit
square. Follow these directions from the start: 2D 4R 2D 4R 3D 3R 2D 2R
2D 2U 6R 4D 1U 5L 5R 3U 6L 4D 1U 7L 2D 4L 7D 1L 2D 6R 6L 1U 2R 1L 3U 1L

2R 1U 1R 2D 1U 2L 2D 17R. You can see the exit square now. Go back and
get a few more blocks to build the final path to the exit square. You
also need to use the block that's given to you at the bottom near the
exit square.



LEVEL 118 - MISS DIRECTION
Password: OSCW

Go down at the start and slide on the ice. Go up when you stop. Continue
going up (avoid the pink ball if he gets in your way) and go right at
the recessed wall to get the green key. Then follow the path downward,
go down at the blue wall, and go through the green lock at the bottom
right to get the blue key. Now make your way back to the start (via the
ice path) and go up. Go around in this loop counter clockwise (following
the fireball) and go through the blue lock to get the red key. Continue
going around in the same direction but don't enter the red key yet.
Continue until you reach the flippers (if the toggle door is closed,
wait for the fireball to open it for you). Now go around and enter the
red lock. Swim into the teleport at the left. Go through the teleport
again through the bottom. The ice path will lead you to the exit square.



LEVEL 119 - SLIDE STEP
Password: PHTY

First go down and get the two chips. Return to the start and go up to
get the chip at the left and the fire boots at the right. Return to the
start and go right. The chips here are protected by a group of bees. Get
the chips slowly and exit the bee area at the bottom right. Now you are
at the paramecium area. Get the chips carefully so that the paramecium
won't get you. Now go left across the gravel. Push the block left into
the ice and follow it. Quickly go down so the block won't hit you when
it bounces back. Collect the chips in this area. Go down the force
floors and get all the chips. Try to avoid the pink ball bouncing around
the area. When there are no more chips (it says 0 chips left), go
through the teleport and into the exit square.



LEVEL 120 - ALPHABET SOUP
Password: FLXP

The level is called "alphabet soup" because each room has a letter in it
made of blocks (or something else). You start the level in room a.
Go around to the right and go through the fake wall. Get into the
teleport by moving left (now in room b), into the teleport again (room
c), circle around to the left and into the teleport (now in room d).
Wait for the teeth to go into the teleport, then go in again (room e).
Wait for the teeth to get in the teleport, then enter the teleport
again (room f). The teeth should now be stuck in a bear trap. [NOTE: If
not, then you should wait a second longer after the teeth goes into the
teleport]. Now get the four chips at the corners of room f and the fire
boots from under the block (don't step on the brown switch, it frees the
teeth). Go into the teleport (room g)... and go down across the ice to
collect the chips and ice skates. In the teleport again (go to room i).
Use all the tanks to destroy the bombs. Go in the teleport (back to room
a) and get the blue key. Enter the teleports twice and get the red key
from room c. [NOTE: Do not go left through the teleport in room e or
you will hit the teeth]. Go in the teleport twice (R,L) and go through
the red lock in room e. Get the chip and the green key under the block.
Go into the teleport 7 times (R, L, R, L, R, L, R). You should now be in
room d. Push the brown block over the yellow key and circle around to
get it by pushing the block down from the top. Get the two chips from
this room. Go to room i (remember not to go left through the teleport in
this room) and get the flippers from the fire area at the bottom. Swim
down to open the yellow door. Go to room b, open the blue door, and let
the teeth chase you into the teleport. Go back there for the last chip!
Return to room i and take the path to the exit square.



LEVEL 121 - PERFECT MATCH
Password: BPYS

This level is... weird. It's seems very impossible at first and the hint
given to you is very vague. What you really need to do is match the
pattern of the fireballs at the top with the pattern of the fireballs at
the bottom so that the green button will be closed every time a fireball
is supposed to be cloned at the bottom. Then no fireballs will be made
at the bottom and you can go through there to the exit square. It's THAT
simple! Actually, that wasn't very simple at all, huh? Here's a simpler
(yet totally different) solution: Keep cloning fireballs until the bear
traps are completely packed with fireballs and they can't move around to
hit the green button. Also get rid of extra fireballs at the top by
pushing them into the water (with the help of the block). Then the
toggle door will remain closed and no fireballs will be cloned at the
bottom. Then you can go through the path and into the exit square.



LEVEL 122 - TOTALLY FAIR
Password: SJUM

I find this level kind of fun (even through you probably won't). First,
go right six spaces to collect 3 chips (don't get the last one yet). Now
go up and trick the teeth into going to the left, then run to through
the recessed wall and into this area. Keep running from the teeth and
try to get him stuck in one of the bear traps. Do you notice the other
teeth in the little box? You need to lead him through the maze so that
he goes to the bear trap switch. Here's how to do that (always be
careful to avoid the glider that patrols the area): From the space just
under the bottom-left bear trap, go 6L 10U (wait 2 sec) 8D (wait 2 sec)
8U (wait 2 sec) 6D (wait 2 sec) 5U (wait 2 sec) 3D. Now the teeth is
stepping on the bear trap switch. Now go through the force floor at the
top right and get the 2 chips at the right (remember, the teeth is
standing on the bear trap switch). Return to the beginning, get collect
final chip, and get in the exit square.



LEVEL 123 - THE PRISONER
Password: YKZE

First, go one step down to pressing the green button. The fireballs path
will touch the clone button and blocks will be cloned. Step on the first
block to pound it into the water. After the second block is cloned,
press the toggle button again to stop the cloning of blocks. Now you
need to push the block on the ice so that it hits the fireball and makes
it turn and hit the bombs, freeing you. If you want, you can use more
blocks to cover up the water (but that won't really be of much use).
Clone a block and use it to block the cloning machine at the top. Get
another block and use it to cover up the water beside the cloning
machine. Run outside and collect the three chips while evading the
teeth. This can be very difficult. Now head towards the exit square at
the top right. Done! [NOTE: If you want to be safe, you could trap two
teeth with the pink ball at the bottom before you go outside to collect
the chips. Use the ice paths to lure them there.]



LEVEL 124 - FIRETRAP
Password: TASX

In a few seconds, a fireball will get stuck in the beartrap. Step on the
beartrap switch to free him. Now QUICKLY go across the force floors and
push the brown block all the way into the upper right corner. Now get in
the beartrap before the fireball comes. If you were fast enough, the
fireball will hit the beartrap switch and free you. Go down when the
fireball hits the switch. Now get all the chips from this maze of fire.
Then go up into the place with blue tanks and go left (hitting the
switches). Get the chip and the red key... then return to the fire maze.
Get the blue key from the bottom left part of the maze (hit the green
switch if you have to). If you've collected all the chips you could (13
left), take the ice path at the left. When you stop, *continue* sliding
right and get the 3 chips (10 left). Then return and go down to a
fireball area. Get the chip at the left. Go through the blue lock and
get the chip. Bring the block into the main fireball area and push it
into the upper left corner. This will cause the fireballs to hit the
green switch and continuously toggle the doors. Go down and take the
path of the left toggle door. There's a fireball going around here. Push
the block into the upper left corner to make the fireball hit the blue
switch. Now return all the way to the blue tank area. This time, the
tanks move by themselves every 5 seconds... go right this time and get the
fire boots. Now you can go on all the fire! Hit the brown switch and
return to the very beginning. Go past the fire and get the four chips.
Next, go to the place where the fireball is hitting the blue switch. Go
past the fire and get the chip. Then take the path of the right toggle
door. Go through the fire and get the remaining chips. Continue right
and into the exit square.



LEVEL 125 - MIXED NUTS
Password: MYRT

First, push the four blocks through the force floors and into the water.
Do this in a way that the glider will be trapped in the *middle*. Then
cross a force floor and collect the chips, avoiding the glider. Go up
and right when the ball is at your left. Follow the path until you reach
some blocks. Take the bottom block and push it into the water. Return to
the top block and push all of the blocks ONE space down... then go to
the top and push all of the blocks ONE space left. You can now push the
bottom block around into the water. Repeat the process of pushing the
blocks down and left until you used all the blocks in the water (and
collected the chips). Continue on the path until you reach some force
floors. Go to the left line of chips and collect everything, then go up
to the top and press right twice quickly to move to the center line.
Collect all the chips like this and exit through the right (press right
two times quickly). Now you're at a large group of blocks. Each of these
blocks has a chip under it. Push all of the blocks and collect the chips
under them (you don't need these blocks later). Take the path up to the
ice area. You need to go into the ice at all six spaces to collect all
the chips. Also collect all the chips from the areas that spawn from the
force floor path. When you've collected all the chips (chips remaining:
0), go through the chip socket at the top. Enter the force floor path at
the very right... press down to go into the teleport (when you're above
it, of course)... and into the exit square.



LEVEL 126 - BLOCK N ROLL
Password: QRLD

First, collect the chips in this area and use the blocks to build a
bridge over the water at the top right (don't use any blocks where you
don't need them). You'll need 6 blocks to cross the first pool of water,
2 more to cross the little "river". You should have 26 chips left when
you finish with this area. Now go up to the top left area with the maze
of water. You need to push the blocks into the water to get all the
chips. I got it on my first try... but I was never able to do it again
:( . When you finish with the water maze, go to the top right and get
the chips from the bugs. The middle bug can be tricky, watch out for
him (remember: bugs follow the wall at their left hand side). Next, get
the chips around the rest of the level. When you get to the bottom right
area (with the bugs circling the blocks)... there are chips under SOME
of the blocks. The other blocks have fire on them. The chips are on
blocks A2, A4, B1, B3, B5, C2, and C4. [NOTE: Three rows, five columns.
Rows are the letters, columns are the numbers]. Push the blocks inward
so they don't disturb the pattern of the bees. If you have all the
chips, go to the exit square at the right.



LEVEL 127 - SKELZIE
Password: JMWZ

[NOTE: All of the step here should be done quickly, or else you'll get
hit by the pink ball] First, step left to avoid getting hit by the pink
ball. Then immediately follow the pink ball into the teleport. You need
to go up and down into the teleport 7 times (U,D,U,D,U,D,U). Get the red
key and enter the teleport 2 more times (D,U). Stand at the left side of
the teleport and enter it 8 times (R,L,R,L,R,L,R,L). Now go around to
the right side of the teleport and enter it 8 times (L,R,L,R,L,R,L). Go
down to under the teleport and enter it 6 times (U,D,U,D,U,D). Get out
through the recessed wall and get the blue key and chip from to upper
right corner... get the chip and yellow key from to bottom left
corner... get the chip and green key from the bottom right corner... and
get the chip and step on the toggle switch in the upper left corner. Go
to the middle bottom area and enter the teleport 6 times (D,U,D,U,D,U).
Exit!



LEVEL 128 - ALL FULL
Password: FTLA

Go around and get the flippers. Step on the red clone button until
there's a solid wall of three pink balls. Swim through the water and to
the right area to get the yellow key (key:1). Go through the lock
(key:0) and sacrifice your flippers to the spy. Go left getting the
chips, ride the force floors, and get the suction boots, fireboots, and
the yellow key (key:1). Use these to get the chips from the big fire
area and from the pink ball. Also get the yellow key at the bottom left
of the big fire area (key:2). Next, pass through the recessed wall and
collect the yellow key (key:3) and the 3 chips surrounding it. Push the
block up into the water, collecting the flippers. Go back down and
through the two recessed walls. Get the yellow key behind the water at
the left (key:4). Move now into the area above you. Follow the fireballs
around and get the four chips. Go to the right, slide across the ice,
and circle around to reach the spy with two yellow locks above him. Go
through the spy (you'll lose all you're footwear) and the two yellow
locks (key:2). Collect all the chips you need... but you don't need to
collect ALL of the chips. Just watch the chip counter to tell when you
don't need anymore chips. Then go through the two yellow locks (key:0)
and into the exit square!



LEVEL 129 - LOBSTER TRAP
Password: HEAN

This level is fun. It seems like it's going to be difficult with all the
gliders and bugs scattered all around the place... but it seems soooo
easy when you figure out how to make the monsters move in an organized
manner. First, build a path going around the entire level (along the
outside wall). This is the path where the gliders will go. Then go to
the water at the bottom of the level. You should build a path to free
the gliders directly at the LEFT of the water. Don't make the path at
the right. As the gliders at leaving, stay at the side and watch for all
of them to leave. If needed, make another path for more gliders to pass
through. When all gliders are circling around the sides of the level, go
over to where the bugs are. You need to free them and make them go to
the water and drown [NOTE: Bugs travel along their left hand wall. They
should go at the wall at the right and down into the water.]. When all
bugs are gone, collect all the chips and go into the exit square.



LEVEL 130 - ICE CUBE
Password: XHIZ

I didn't find this level too hard. Just slide around on the ice and
collect the chips. If you really need it, here are the directions: U3 (to
enter the ice) R R L U D D U U U L L D L R U R R L L D R U D L R D R D D
U D U D R U R D L L. Now g through the chip socket and into the exit
square.



LEVEL 131 - TOTALLY UNFAIR
Password: FIRD

Another evil level. The trick is to keep in mind that the layout of
this level is almost exactly the same as level 122 (Totally Fair). The
only difference is that the recessed walls are now regular walls,
blocking your passage into the area with the teeth. That is what the
hint here means: "SJUM" is the password of level 122. The time on this
level is severely limited to only 60 seconds, so you have to move fast.
First, go 6 steps left to collect 3 chips. Then go straight up to the
space right below the hint block. Next, move 22 spaces right and 17
steps up (wait a moment), 8 steps down (wait a moment), 8 steps up
(wait a moment), 6 steps down (wait a moment), 5 steps up (wait a
moment), 3 steps down and you should hear the sound of the teeth
stepping on the bear trap switch. Collect all the remaining chips and
go into the exit square at the left side.



LEVEL 132 - MIX UP
Password: ZYFA

This level takes a lot of time to do (at least for me). First, go to the
upper left corner of the level where there are 4 blocks in a line. Use
all four blocks to form a bridge to the red key below you. When you have
the red key, return to the area above the beginning. Use ALL of the
blocks here to build a bridge across the water at the right. At the end,
there's a teeth guarding a blue key. To get the blue key: Take away two
blocks from the corner of the place, get the teeth in that area, circle
around to a safe side and quickly dart in and out to get the key. Go to
the area below you (with the toggle switches) and collect the chips. To
get to the right side beyond the walkers, you need to toggle the walls
so that the ball (on your left) won't hit the clone switch. Then you can
safely go to the right. Go back to the start and through the red lock.
Use ALL of the blocks here to destroy the bombs and get the green key.
Now go down past the bees and to the left. Use ALL of the blocks to
build two bridges over the two water paths below you. Make sure you
don't get any blocks into a position that you can't use them anymore.
Take the right path and get the four chips from these force floors
(don't touch any recessed wall that you don't need to, lots of circling
around involved here). Then take the left path down. DON'T use the blue
key on the lock surrounded by blocks. Instead, use it at the other lock.
Collect the blue key. Make the teeth follow you into the ice [IMPORTANT
NOTE: At the end, hold the *down* button so you can escape throughout the
force floors and not bounce back to the teeth.] Return to the bottom
left and use the blocks to build a bridge over the water (use the key on
the lock). Get the last chip! Return to the bee place and get in the
exit square.



LEVEL 133 - BLOBDANCE
Password: TIGG

This level is very similar the Level 23 (BLOBDANCE). The strategy is
pretty much the same also: You need to avoid the blobs and collect the
chips while moving from block to block and keeping safe by staying on
the gravel and only moving when it's safe. The blobs have a completely
random movement but they never move diagonally. As you progress through
this level, the number of blobs in each square will steadily increase.
The main strategy to beating this level is patience. The time is
unlimited so you can wait as long as you want before making your move.
You should try to stay on the gravel when waiting, obviously.



LEVEL 134 - PAIN
Password: XPPH

Go down and right until the end (don't go through the dirt yet). There
should be a bug there going around in circles. When another bug comes
and the bug starts moving normally, go through the dirt [NOTE: The next
step should be done quickly]. Get the chips and step aside to free the
bugs. Continue getting more chips and freeing more bugs until you reach
a brown block. Push the first block upwards and push the second block
downwards. Also get the rest of the chips. If you were fast enough, you
should begin to see the bugs going into the water at the bottom. Now use
the last block to build a bridge across the water at the left (you need
to do quite a bit of circling around). Cross down to the bottom area
with the blocks. Use one block to build a bridge to the fireboots. Then
Go to the right and build a path going down to the last chip. After
collecting the chip, you need to use the blocks to build a path ALL THE
WAY TO THE EXIT SQUARE. This is terribly time consuming. Luckily, you
don't need to use ALL of the blocks.



LEVEL 135 - TRUST ME
Password: LYWO

Go right one step, then up one step, then right until you're just left
of the force floor and above the gravel. Move in a straight line down to
get the yellow key and quickly come back up before the bugs get you. Go
back left, through the yellow lock, and into the exit square. Now wasn't
that easy? You didn't even have to go through that big mess of recessed
walls, green blocks, force floors and enemies!

LEVEL 137 - GOLDKEY
Password: HPPX

You start this level in a paramecium infested area. Make your way to the
top right and past the gravel without getting hit by paramecia. Get the
five yellow keys from here without getting hit by the bugs (you might
want to follow the bugs around to avoid them). Then go through the four
yellow locks at the bottom right to reach the force floor area. Now you
need to do a series of quick ups and downs to get to the yellow key at
the other side. You'll go into the fire if you stay on any force floor
for too long. Just concentrate well and find a way to get yourself into
a little loop (by pressing up and down) so you can analyze your next
step. After getting the yellow key, enter the yellow lock at the top
left. From the space where the yellow lock was, take these directions:
(don't move while you're on the force floors, wait until you come to a
stop before moving again) 2U 4R 2U 1R 1D 1U 2R 2D 1R 24L 2U 1R 1U 3R 3U.
Now go left and through the recessed wall, make your way past the pink
balls, and get the flippers at the left. Go take the force floor path
right into the water and go up past the recessed wall. Get the yellow
key from those bugs and go through another recessed wall at the top
right. From the square of the recessed wall, go 1R 1D 1L 4D 4R 2U 2R 2U.
The blue wall at the top left corner is open... so go through it and go
up and right all the way to the exit square.



LEVEL 138 - PARTIAL POST
Password: LUJT

It took me soooo long to figure out this level. First, travel through
the teleport 5 times (vertically). Now you are in a room full of blocks.
Push a block so that there are 2 blocks directly to the right of the
teleport (this way you can't go to this room when you enter a teleport
from the left). Now bring a block with you through the teleport and put
it directly at the right of the teleport. Get another block and place it
right beside that block so that there are 2 blocks beside the teleport.
See the pattern? You need to place 2 blocks directly at the right of
each teleport so that the directions are rerouted and going through the
teleport from the exit square room... will simply take you to the exit
square (because it has nowhere else to go since you blocked all the
other teleports). You're time is a little short on this level so you'll
have to work fast.



LEVEL 139 - YORKHOUSE
Password: VLHH

Chips everywhere... and walkers everywhere! Walkers are actually my
most hated of all monsters. They move straight forward and turn in a
random direction when they hit a wall. This makes it impossible to
predict their movements. When releasing the walkers, try to open their
passage when they're moving away from you. This way you have time to
escape and let them go without them hitting you. I guess it would be a
good idea to release the walkers last... although I just released them
when I got to them. When you've collected all 388 chips, go to the exit
square at the corners of the dirt area at the bottom.



LEVEL 140 - ICEDEATH
Password: SJUK

I found this level to be pretty hard. It's really similar to Level 051
(I SLIDE) but much harder because of the water. For each square of land
in this level, there's usually 1 correct way to move, 1 move top return
to where you came from, and 2 moves that bring you to water. Follow
these directions: 1U 1R 2U 1L 1D 1R 1D 1R 3D 2L 2U 2L 1U 1L 1U 1L 1D 1R
1D 1L 2D 1R 1D 2R 1U 1R 1U 1R 2U 2L 1U 3L 2D 2R 1D 2R 2D 2R 1U 3L 1U 2L
1D 4R 2U 4L 4U 2R 1D 5R 1U. Now that you have the ice skates, you can
walk normally to the exit square at the center of the level.



LEVEL 141 - UNDERGROUND
Password: MCJE

I hate this stage. It seems easy since you know exactly what to do
(collect chips by building paths through the dirt and avoiding the
paramecia). But it's actually hard because the paramecia move quite fast
and they're hard to control. The first thing you should do in this stage
is clear as much dirt as you can without freeing any paramecia from
their cells. Then, free the paramecia one-by-one while collecting the
chips. Here's a tip: make sure there are no hallways that are only one
square wide. This causes the paramecia to get mixed up when they meet in
these hallways. Also remember their movement pattern: they always stay
along their right hand wall. There's only 15 chips to collect in this
level. Also try to avoid freeing paramecia that you don't need to free
in order to get a chip. When you've collected all the chips, get in the
exit square at the top right.



LEVEL 142 - PENTAGRAM
Password: UCRY

After a short inspection, a realized this level is impossible to do
without making a map. Follow these directions: 1R 3U 1R 1U (Chip) 5R 1D
1R 1D 1R 1D 1R 1D 1R 1D 2R 2D (Chip) 3L 1D 4L 1D 6L (Chip) 1D 14L (Chip)

(exit square). Done! This level is quite similar to Level 016
(Cellblocked) because of the recessed walls, but much more complicated.

LEVEL 144 - FIREFLIES
Password: GVXQ

This level is the kind of level that needs a lot of patience... the kind
of level that I'm not good at :). The fireballs pose a serious threat
to you. It's good to remember the behavior of the fireballs and
yourself: The fireballs can move normally through regular floor and the
fires, but they can't go through gravel or regular walls. YOU can move
normally on regular floor and gravel, but you can't go through fire or
the regular walls. Always anticipate where you're going to go and find
a spot of gravel at the place where you're going so you have a place to
plan further. Don't move to quickly, that just makes you careless (and
besides, you have unlimited time).



LEVEL 145 - Thanks to...
Password: TONY

When you look at the little black box that tells you the name of the
level and the password, it shows "Thanks to...TONY". The Tony is
probably referring to Tony Krueger, who you can see in the "About Chip's
Challenge" under the help menu (windows version). This level also thanks
some other people: Doug T. (in the toggle doors), Rob D. (in the
gravel), Ed H. (in the fire), Lisa F. (in the ice), and the WEP 4 test
team (the hint beside the exit). Anyhow, here's how to beat the level:
slide across the ice and enter the teleport. Now go down and get the
fireboots from the bottom right part of the gravel. Use them to cross
the fire and slide across the ice. Take the force floor path to the
bottom right... take one step right into the exit square. Whew! That was
easy! [NOTE: This is the only level in Chip's Challenge where the title
isn't spelled in all capital letters. Weird...]



LEVEL 146 - CAKE WALK
Password: JHEN

First, go to the right side and use a block to stop the fireballs from
being cloned. Now use these blocks to build a bridge beside the ice and
force floor path. Continue building the bridge until you get the suction
boots. Then build a horizontal bridge from your bridge just under the 3
blocks (going right to the chips). Collect the chips and the red key
(9 chips left). Go to the left side and collect all the chips there (4
chips left). Then repeat the process you did on the right side to
collect the remaining chips and the blue key. You will need to transfer
some blocks from the right side to do this. Now go to the bottom of the
middle path and stand between the two brown blocks. Push a block to the
side and quickly move down (the block bounces back). Push the LEFT block
upwards to build a path to get the fireboots. Go down into the force
floor area (don't push a block in there yet) and use the key on the red
lock that's directly under the exit square. Push a block into the force
floors and it will go to the space of the lock you just opened. Push it
into the water and get in the exit square.



LEVEL 147 - FORCE FIELD
Password: COZA

I found this level very hard. Well, maybe more time consuming and
annoying than hard. You need a lot of patience (and free time) to beat
this level. What you're actually trying to do is get the chips so you
can pass through the chip socket and get the suction boots. Then you can
move freely around the level and into the exit square. When you start
out, you should just go around forcing yourself to the nearby chips.
Then you should start analyzing the patterns of the force floors so you
know what button to press to get to the next area or chip. I found that
it was quite easy to get the chips at the left side... but the right
side of the level kept of bringing me back to the left. Just remember to
look ahead so that you know where you're going next. Luckily, you have
all the time you need to beat this level. Oh yeah, good luck!



LEVEL 148 - MIND BLOCK
Password: RGSK

I didn't find this level too hard... and it's definitely not worthy of
being Level 148! Anyhow, you need to clone brown blocks and use them to
form a path through the mess of bombs to the chips and eventually the
exit square. Be patient-- you have unlimited time. Try to get rid of all
the bombs near the center where you might make a misstep and die. The
level is divided into four sections. Most of the chips are at the
corners of these sections. The exit square can be found at the right of
the upper area.



LEVEL 149 - SPECIAL
Password: DIGW

This is it, the last level of the game. Get the yellow key and go
through the yellow lock. Get the blue key and go through the blue lock.
Get the red key and go through the red lock. Get the green key and go
through the green lock. Enter the teleport. Use the two blocks at the
right to build a bridge going to the RIGHT (don't use the left block, it
has fire under it). Now use the second block and the fourth block to
build a bridge going UP. Now there's a whole bunch of blocks, and only
two of them don't have fire under them! Stand at the bottom-left corner
and follow these directions: 2U 4R 4U. The block above you is the first
block, push it into the water at the top. Return to the bottom left
corner and follow these directions: 4R 6U 3R. The block above you is the
second block, use it to complete the bridge you started with the other
block. Cross up to the top area and go as far left as you can. Go up
to the top strip of land and push the leftmost block aside. Tada! You
completed the game!

| 4) BEST TIMES                                                        |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------'


No, these are NOT all MY best times. I collected them from Alice Voith's
excellent Chip's Challenge site (http://www.geocities.com/~fishofgold/).
These were done by various people that I do not know and I'm not really
sure if they want their name included here. Again, these are not my own
records.

The times shown here are the REMAINING time when you beat the level, not
the time it took you to complete. If you are able to beat any of these
times here, go ahead and e-mail me... but I don't think you can beat the
times here anyway. [NOTE: NA means "Not applicable" because these levels
are not timed.]

| 6) TIPS AND SECRETS                                                  |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------'


- Here's a trick that would make the entire above section worthless: If
you press CTRL-T, there will be an "Ignore passwords" command under the
game menu of Chip's Challenge. When this is activated, you won't need to
enter a password when you go to a level. You can go to any level you
want using the "Goto" command under the level menu without entering a
password.

- Every time you restart a level (after dying), your score is subtracted
by 20%. To prevent this from happening, you can go to "best times" under
the game menu and click on the level you are on and you will not lose
any points.

- The name of level 145 is "Thanks to...". And the password is "TONY".
When it is viewed at the beginning of the stage, is says
"Thanks to...TONY". This is probably referring to Tony Krueger who you
can see when you look at "About Chip's Challenge" under the Help menu.

- The passwords of level 095 and level 096 are exactly the same. I
really don't know what's up with this. Was it intentional? Was that an
accident? The passwords obviously supposed to be different for each
level, but I was surprised to see this when I made the password
section...

- Level 034 is called 'Cypher'. And 'Cypher' means code. If you make a
map of the level and view it from far, you will see that there are three
rows of four letters each. Each row tells you a different password for
another level in Chip's Challenge. The first row tells the password for
level 082: LLIO. The second row tells the password for level 137: HPPX.
And finally, the third row shows the password for level 146: JHEN.

- There is a file that stores the settings for Chip's Challenge and the
other Windows Entertainment Pack games. This file is usually in the
Windows directory and called entpack.ini. The first settings you'll see
belong to Chip's Challenge. The first settings here are the settings for
the sound effects. You can change these to different .wav or .mid files
that you may have on your hard drive. If you want, you can also change
the current level, the highest level, and the current score.

- Many of the levels in Chip's Challenge have hidden meanings behind
their names. For example: Level 034 - CYPHER means Code. Level 013 -
SOUTHPOLE tells you the direction to the exit square. Level 017 - NICE
DAY comes from the giant happy face which can be see from afar. Level
024 - OORTO GELD is an anagram for toggle door. I could have put all
these secret meanings into a new section if a wanted to.

- This is just weird information now. You know level 145 - Thank you...?
There's a lot of unique stuff about it. First of all, it's the only
level where the title isn't written in all capital letters. Second, when
you look at the introduction box thing, it says "Thanks to...TONY"
(probably referring to Tony Krueger). Third, there's a bunch of other
people thanked in this level: Doug T. (in the toggle doors), Rob D. (in
the gravel), Ed H. (in the fire), Lisa F. (in the ice), and the WEP 4
test team (the hint beside the exit). Lastly, this is the only level
that doesn't have a border around the sides.

| 7) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS                                        |
'----------------------------------------------------------------------'


Q: Where can I find this game?

A: Chip's Challenge is a game by Microsoft originally part of Windows
Entertainment Pack (WEP). Unfortunately, Window's Entertainment Pack is
getting quite rare and hard to find in stores. You can buy WEP through
Microsoft's official website (http://www.microsoft.com). You can order
it there and it will be delivered anywhere in the United States
(including Alaska and Hawaii). No, I will not give it away to you...
Microsoft would get angry at me :)


Q: And what if I don't live in the US...

A: I don't live in the United States either! Chip's Challenge was
included in my hard drive when I bought my PC. Perhaps you can check the
place where you bought your computer... usually they'll have information
about where you can find Window's Entertainment Pack. Or maybe you can
ask someone is the US to order it and send it to you.


Q: How do I beat this level?

A: Check the walkthrough, genius. I don't have time to put up with
losers that can't look through simple 170KB guide for a simple answer to
beating a simple level for such a simple game. Oh, and if I didn't make
a level solution for the level you're talking about, then I probably
didn't beat that level yet. I'm doing this guide as I continue through
the game.


Q: I can't understand your instructions!

A: Uh huh. You mean you can't understand plain English? Or more likely,
my instructions are too complicated for your simple little brain. E-mail
me for clarification on that level. You can also check out Alice Voith's
Chip's Challenge site (http://www.geocities.com/~fishofgold). That's
where I always went to look for help on the net.


Q: Why are you making a guide for such an old game?

A: Because I feel like it... and because there's no other Chip's
Challenge guides at Gamefaqs.com. I know several people that are still
trying to beat the game until today and don't know anywhere to get help.
Also, this is one of the most popular PC games ever created (since many
people already have it included in their hard drive). Hopefully
*someone* will appreciate what I'm doing here.
