  disintegrated quickly and disappeared from the ground. At the same time ,
  the Castle of Darkness began to crumble."

  The Geisha: "Yes Ryu."
  We then see Ryu and the Geisha on a mountain ledge as the Castle of Darkness
  crumbles, the Geisha says: "Did the Shogun die?"
  Ryu: "I don't know. He may appear again like he said... But I'll get him next
  time too! No matter how many times he comes back!"

 3)The ending from Lena's FAQ:

  After defeating the Ancient Ship we cut to Ryu.
  Ryu:  "?!"
  Room starts to vanish, Ryu vanishes out.
  Cut to Irene.
  Irene:  "!!"
  Ryu appears nearby. In the sky, the Ship falls and explodes. Castle Rock
  also falls apart. View scrolls to Ryu and Irene standing atop a mountain
  ledge.
  Ryu: "This is the end of Clancy and Foster and their sinister plan."
  Irene: "I'll never understand why people make and pursue evil plans until
  they wind up dead."
  Ryu: "Humans are always striving to achieve. All of creatures on earth,
  in all worlds, can never be just a part of someone's plans.
  Fortunately, mankind is never foolish enough to wipe itself out to achieve
  some ambitions. Being with you like this, makes me want to thank all the
  living beings in this world. That's my one desire.
  A new day is about to begin."
  Ryu and Irene stand as the sun rises.
  The game restarts after that.

  In the background, Ayane walks off into the distance, looking pleased.
  Rachel and Ryu face each other, and Rachel looks stunned. Ryu turns away and

  Ryu says, "It's over," turns into a bird and flies away.

  the grave he took it from. He turns towards a ledge, leaps over and vanishes.
  A few seconds later we see the same bird flying off into the distance.
