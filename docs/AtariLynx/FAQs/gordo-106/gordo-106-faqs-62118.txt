Gordo 106 is an unsung hero title of sorts and was more or less either
ignored and forgotten at best or criticised at worst. The reason for this 
was most likely due to the high learning curve of the game (i.e. people 
played it and sucked at it and wrote the game off as bad). Part of this 
nay-saying was undoubtedly the stressful dungeon areas. Where most 
platformers simply killed you off, games like Gordo 106 (and Wario World 
for Gamecube) chose to give you a chance to dig yourself out of your 
hole. This is bittersweet. On the plus side you get a chance to redeem 
yourself and save a life. On the negative side the over-all game is 
slowed down and you have to backpeddle your back just to get where you 
were before (i.e. it can feel like you are wasting time). Anyway, I 
believe that when given a chance Gordo 106 is a great Lynx title that
can easily stand alongside Toki, Shadow of the Beast, and Rygar as a classic.
The game has lots of music tracks, paralax scrolling, creative unorthodox
storyline, over 20 fairly long stages, 7 different background graphic sets, 
and not-too-shabby graphics. With practice, the game can be beaten with a 
fair amount of ease.

Walkthrough:

This will be a bottom-line FAQ, meaning that I will try not to waste too 
much time on the obvious and easy sections of levels when what people really 
want to find are the answers to relevant and important questions. For each 
stage, I will focus on the parts that are more likely to cause potential 
problems and letter each in turn.
----------------------------------------------------------

Level 1-1

A. As always, use apples sparingly and take out the lab technicians if they 
stand in your way.

B. Avoid falling into pits as much as possible. The dungeon is not a normal 
stage in the game and there is really no reason to intentionally enter it. 
If you fall in, however, that is a different story! See the end of this FAQ 
for help on exiting the dungeon. To gain more distance in your jumps, simply 
take a running start. This can make it easier to avoid falling in a hole.

C. Open as many cages as possible on this stage. Don't forget the ones in the 
top/left or the top/right parts of the stage. Remember to use a running jump 
if you need more distance. Freeing animals earns points which are useful for 
attaining free lives. Since there are no continues in this game, points are 
very important.

D. The over-hanging lights are easy to swing to and from. Don't worry about 
falling off if you hang for too long. Also, the game is very forgiving as 
you swing from light to light as you keep the direction button pressed and 
jump at the peek of your swing. If you keep the jump button pressed, you 
will automatically go from light to light.

E. Health and ammo does not replenish on each new stage. As such, the 
bananas and apples can be very helpful.

F. Simply touch the exit sign to finish the stage.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1-2

A. The top left of the stage has rabbit cages (dispatch the odd group of 
lab-coated people that act as a singular entity).

B. Near the beginning of the stage you must ride a conveyor belt with some 
bunnies. Avoid riding it into the grinder (a one-hit death). Below the 
grinder is the word "WARNING" written in red letters. Jump to the ledge for 
safety!

C. Remember that you can't jump from the very top of the screen 
(you will hit your head). You can reach the ledge above the 1st no-smoking 
sign by running from the left and holding right as you fall down on it.

D. Spend some time looking around for rabbit cages to open for bonus points.

E. There is another conveyor belt. Avoid the grinders as before (look for the 
WARNING signs). When you see the end of the conveyor belt make sure you 
avoid the pit below by jumping to the right. 

F. There is a switch to turn off the conveyor belts, but it is not essential 
to beating the stage.

G. Get accustomed to the running jump. It is used frequently in this game to 
avoid pits or to reach necessary locations.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Level 1-3 (lab facility)

A. Jump carefully between file cabinets to avoid any pits between them.

B. As soon as you see a giant chemist with a large syringe (yes this game is 
strange) take care to time it right so that you can shoot an apple downward 
and hit him. Don't waste too many apples. After he is defeated walk and hold 
right as you fall from the ledge just above to land to safety.

C. Be cautious of the large pit near the end of the stage! 

D. Remember that not all seemingly "blind jumps" in this game are blind. Take 
some time to see if you can find safety either below or far to the sides. 
Remember that you can sometimes see what is on the other side of a "blind 
jump" if you jump off a ledge just a little, take a peek, and quickly return 
yourself back to where you jumped from. Sometimes a running jump will land 
you on a more distant ledge out of harm's way. Also use trial and error to 
memorize where the pits are located so that you can avoid them. Another 
useful thing to remember is that you can infer the location of solid ground 
by taking note of where the scientists are walking below you.

D. This stage introduces a trampoline which is user-friendly. Just jump on 
it and the sky's the limit.

E. Remember not to bump your head near the top of the screen and don't forget 
to open up rabbit cages as long as they are not too dangerous to reach. The 
goal is to increase the life-count without losing lives in the process!

F. Don't forget about the running jump. It can be a life-saver to clear a 
large distance and avoid a pit and reach higher or more distant ground.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2-1 (hunter's convention)

A. Be careful of the hunters. Their bullets will go over your head, but 
only up to a point, until they arc downward. Apples will take them out. Also 
watch out for the bloodhounds that make an appearance. Don't stand too close 
when attacking because your extended arm can take damage in contact with your 
adversaries.

B. Be very weary of the snapping suitcases near the floor. They are 1-hit 
deaths. I like to traverse the stage as close to the top as much as possible. 
Remember you can swing on the chandeliers to make things easier and stay 
above the floor.

C. Remember that apples and bananas are your friends! Extra health and 
ammo can be very helpful in your journey.

D. Remember to scope out "blind jumps" to see if they are really blind. 
You may be able to take a running jump and land to safety.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
2-2

A. Be cautious of the odd ladies throwing mugs into the air as you jump 
over them. It may help to dispatch any of the ladies walking side to side. 
I like to minimize damage by staying above the floor and using the 
chandeliers to quickly move between flying mugs timing my jumps as best as I 
can. 

B. There are no pits in this stage.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2-3

A. Do not touch the spikes that come out of the metal boxes. They are one-hit 
deaths! Watch their rhythm and time your jumps accordingly. This is especially 
important as you swing on the changeliers above them.

B. Do not touch the buzz saw unless you turn it off first. You will 
eventually need to run against the grain so as to make headway right on a 
high conveyor belt. Near the end, fall and run left to the off switch to turn 
off the saw. 

C. If you dare want any of the fruits on the conveyor belts make sure you 
jump back to safety as soon as possible afterwards. There is a treasure-trove 
of food-stuffs to the left of the stack of metal boxes just to the left of 
the on/off switch that turns off the buzz-saw.

D. The bloodhound and hunter near the beginning can be dispatched from the 
floor to the left of the 3rd metal box!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3-1 (fashion show)

A. As soon as the level starts two jumping dudes in yellow shirts will 
introduce themselves. Throw 2 apples at each of them. If you don't 
anticipate them ahead of time you may take hits.

B. I like to travel along the lights near the top as much as possible, 
but there are some cages to be found near the floor that are tempting as 
well. Plan a route that suits your tastes. Make sure you avoid the 
yellow-shirts, red spiky things, and rolling logs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3-2

A. As before, anticipate and dispatch the yellow-shirt from the right.

B. Use caution as you move under the legs with high-heel shoes as they go up 
and down (no joke!). I like to walk instead of run as I go betwen them. You 
may need to dispatch some enemies from a distance for safety reasons. Do 
not touch the legs or the shoes.

C. I like to stay near the top of the screen using chandeliers as 
appropriate as I move right. There are some cages below which can add bonus 
points, however (just be careful as they are surrounded by pits which lead 
to the dungeon).

D. Don't bump your head by jumping too close to the top of the screen. You 
may have to jump to some ledges from closer below.

E. I like to disregard the yellow-shirts below and touch the exit sign by 
falling and holding right from above.
----------------------------------------------------------

3-3

A. As soon as the stage starts, get to the safety of the 2nd ledge above you as 
large burly hunters will start walking and shooting around you. A large net may 
fall and damage you some. I have found this hard to avoid. So are the breaks! 
There is a cage and banana on the right, but I like to avoid it as there is 
another net there that will fall. Using a running start where appropriate, 
work your way left. You may take hits from additional falling nets and/or a 
red spikey thing. Swing from lights as appropriate until you can see a red 
spikey enemy. Don't touch it. Instead, drop to the safety of the small ledge 
just below it. Do a running jump to the ledge containing a banana. Do another 
running jump to the left. Now, before you rinse and repeat a third time, make 
sure to watch the enemies and bullets below and time your running jump so 
that you safely land at the level exit without touching any enemies or 
bullets.

B. I generally don't worry too much about the cages on this stage.

C. This level can be tough and make or break a sensitive monkey!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

4-1 (warehouse)

A. The moving metal pipes will kill on-site full-stop. They are very dangerous. 
Generally, I like to jump at about the same time the press makes contact with 
the floor. When standing between the presses, make sure you are exactly in the 
middle and not allowing your tail or cap to come into too much contact with 
them. Remember to watch their patterns and get the timing down. There is no 
time-limit to the stages, so be patient. Sometimes simply walking will get you 
past some of the steam presses so don't feel like you have to run constantly. 
Give the poor monkey a break once in a while!

B. The puppy doors are like rabbit cages and earn points. Open the ones that 
are easy to find and leave the ones that are too dangerous behind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4-2

A. Save all the puppies you can, but take care not to fall into the manholes 
or you will have to face the dungeon. Remember to try your best to scope out 
seemingly blind-jumps to see if you can spot safe ground below or in the 
distance.

B. You will see a large dude throwing stuff. I like to get on the crate 
closest to him and make sure not to touch him or his bullets. Carefully toss 
apples at him. He takes lots of hits, and hopefully you won't run out of 
ammo! 

C. Time your running/jumping/walking so that you do not come into contact with 
the chefs, their hands, or what they drop from above.

D. I like to use the sky-lights as much as possible and stay near the top of 
the screen. Regarding the big dude with the fishing net, you can dispatch him 
with apples from a distance. If you are out of ammo it might help to run 
through him and the first chef on their ledge and minimize damage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

4-3

A. Carefully get past the chefs without taking damage.

B. Do not touch the ceiling fans (one-hit deaths) especially the ones close to 
you unless you turn them off first. Pay attention and don't forget about them 
as they are scattered around the entire level.

C. Carefully get past the moving pillars as before. You can run out of lives 
quickly if you don't! Remember to stand directly between them as it can be a 
fairly tight squeeze. Get the timing done also. This is probably one of the 
hardest levels in the game!

D. You can dispatch the dude with the net safely below him.

E. I like to stay close to the top of the level as usual. 

F. When you see two metal presses side-by-side, I like to get on the lower 
platform (via careful jumping or falling). Next, I like to carefully land 
under the first press ASAP without touching it and move past the second press 
as soon as it is safe. It might help to study their movements for a bit before 
taking the plunge.

G. Watch out for man-holes and memorize where they are. But don't forget to 
poke around seemingly blind-jumps to see if you can spot safe land below or 
ahead.

H. Turn the fans off, but not until carefully dispatching the net-dude from a 
distance with apples.

I. Be careful when jumping over the stacked crates near the end of the stage 
as they may have man-holes between them. Determine if regular or running jumps 
suit you or the situation better.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

5-1: Nautical ship

A. Go left and carefully dispatch the large hunter before the pirate tank 
approaches. Ascend up/right and swing along the handles to the right.

B. Stay to the top of the screen as much as possible in this stage. Remember 
to take a running jump between ledges as needed.

C.If you find yourself seemingly unable to continue swinging along the handles, 
you may have to think a bit and get to the "out of reach" handle by taking a 
running jump from farther back. Remember that it is not always easy to take a 
"running fall" hoping to grab a handle that way.

D. You will eventually come to a high vertical pillar with a hunter on the 
right (and the pirate tank on the left).Be careful, because even when you are 
standing on this pillar the pirate's cap can still hurt you (jump straight up 
if it comes close to you). Just to the right of the pillar on the ground is a 
trampoline. When it is safe, use the trampoline to fly more or less straight 
up and grab the closest handle. Continue to the right and stand on the last 
ledge you can. When it is safe, avoid enemies and holes and use the last 
trampoline to jump over the hole on it's right and  work your way to the end 
of the stage. The pirate can be dispatched on this stage, but he takes lots 
of hits and it is not necessary.
---------------------------------------------------------------

5-2 

A.Get the banana on the right if you need it and go left and avoid the man-hole 
and use the trampoline to get up to the handles. Stay near the top of the 
screen and use the high handles as much as possible on your journey right. If 
a handle seems out of reach, running jumps and/or jumping from a lower or 
farther ledge may be necessary. Grab any fruit if convenient and necessary.

B. You will notice a low ledge with an apple on it as you are walking along 
a high floor. Since you will bump your head from this current height, 
remember that you can reach the ledge under the apple by running off the 
high ledge and carefully landing on the apple. Next, jump to the next narrow 
platform above you (but NOT to the top-most wide floor). From here, you can 
safely reach the next set of handles! Swing right till you land on safe and 
solid ground.

C. The next part is similar to the previous, in that you will notice a banana 
down/right while you are standing on the high floor. Instead of bumping your
head, take a running fall and land on the banana. From this ledge, jump to the 
next set of handles! Swing to safe ground as before.

D. Carefully walk right and you will see a red apple. Take a running fall and 
land under the apple and ascend to the top-most floor. Fall on the exit sign 
when safe and clear of the pirate-tank.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

5-3

A. This stage can be a guy-killer and make short work of the stash of lives 
you have accumulated thus far. I like to go left and take the trampoline 
upwards. Next, I like to use the handles near the top as I work my way left 
to the high and safe ground. Watch how the monster below runs back and forth 
under you (he is a calm gorilla wearing an angry helmet). When safe, work 
your way along the top of the screen using handles as necessary. If you 
happen to fall, there is a trampoline which can be used to get you back up as 
you work your way top/left to safer ground.

B. From your safe high ledge, you will notice a small platform under you and 
another small platform to your left. When safe, fall off your current ledge 
and turn right to land on the lower one. Quickly before the monster returns, 
take a running jump and work your way left to the on/off machine and turn
it off.

C. Now go back to the beginning of the stage. Dont worry about the gorilla. 
The switch you hit turned on his happy hat! Now he will help you to the exit. 
Just climb on his back and that is that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

6-1

A. Jump on the columns and work your way top/right. Swing on the chandeliers 
but be careful of the spider who approaches from the right. Keep working your 
way top/right as you swing on lights and avoid the rich thugs swinging their 
arms. Take some time to watch, learn, and prepare for the move. You will 
come to an impasse where you are standing on a high ledge. It is possible to 
take a running fall and grab the right-most light below you. Work your way 
right and grab the apple.

B. Continue right/up using lights and/or running jumps as necessary to 
maintain your position near the top of the screen. Remember that some ledges 
that seem out of reach may be reached via jumping from a lower or farther 
ledge and using running jumps.  

C. Only grab fruit if it is safe to do so. Be weary of the large thugs and the 
man-holes below.

D. Work your way to the pillar with an apple on top (lower down). Carefully 
dispatch the thug and spider on the right from a safe distance (make sure
your arm doesn't touch the enemies as you throw apples).

E. Use the trampoline to reach the high ledge safe and sound from the 
laser-beam that comes. The next bit is tricky. You want to work fast to ensure 
you don't take more hits than necessary. Work your way right using running 
jumps as necessary  to maintain some height until you are on a ledge above 
an investigator holding a flashlight. Run right and as SOON as you start to 
fall, reverse direction and hang towards the exit sign. You might take a hit 
from the investigator, but hopefully you will beat the level.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6-2

A. Work your way left and avoid man-holes, spiders, and large thugs in the 
process until you can ascend and swing right along the lights. Continue to
trek right and watch out for stray spiders. Grab any fruit only if safe (you 
may have to run/jump from an alternate ledge to reach them). Remember that 
you can sometimes run/fall if a ledge seems too far away to land on in 
situations where you are too high to jump without bumping your head.

B. In general, and as per usual, try to keep near the top as you continue 
right and swing along lights. Be careful and patient as you scope out ahead 
to prepare for the odd spider fight. Remember that you don't always have to 
make a running jump to reach ledges. A regular one might be just fine.You may 
run low on ammo as you fight thugs and/or spiders. Collecting the odd apple 
may be just what the doctor ordered. But be careful. If a light seems 
out-of-reach remember that (as before) you may be able to run and fall and 
just barely grab the next one.

C. Continue to the high ledge out of harm's way from the laser beam. Try to 
use as many lights to swing from as you can as you quickly go right. Take 
running jumps as needed to traverse to the right without falling into any 
holes. Like stage 6-1, at this point I like to work fast and get to the exit 
as soon as possible when you see the investigator with the flashlight.

-------------------------------------------------------------
6-3

A. Use the trampoline and work your way left swinging from lights under any 
spiders that get in your way. Either use running jumps or carefully regular
jump from ledge to ledge as you go left. You almost beat the game, so press 
on soldier!! Rinse and repeat as you go left. If you fall on the floor 
watch out for any dungeon holes. If this happens, you may have to backtrack 
a bit to get back up near the top of the screen. 

B. Traverse left as per usual. Jump between the stone pillars (using running 
jumps if necessary). You will see the familiar laser-beam make a return 
visit. Make another jump to the next ledge. You will eventually see the 
investigator. This time he can be defeated! He is actually the final boss. 
Make sure you have a reserve of apples by this point and throw them at him. 
He should go down shortly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ending

Congratulations, you beat the game!!!! If you are like me, you by now 
realize that this isn't such a bad little game after all. The ending is 
kinda cool as it shows fireworks and free animals running amok. Text 
soon follows letting you know that Gordo will be there wherever there 
is trouble in the world.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dungeon

A. So you fell into the dungeon eh? Now you gotta get back out again. It 
can be frustrating, stressful, and/or freaky to be down here. It is tough 
and most contact with fire will result in a one-hit death. There are a 
myriad of parts to the dungeon, and it can be relatively random where you start 
or end up. You can find an exit out of the dungeon with careful navigating, 
and you can also find alternate man-holes to fall into to get to another 
location. Manholes may also take you to a death-room with no escape or a bonus 
room with lots of rabbits to free from cages. Navigating around the dungeon 
requires good platform skills. The timing required to move between fire blasts 
is critical. Watch and learn from a distance. Also watch for small fire blasts 
that come from the horse statues. Remember that this dungeon is NOT a regular 
level. I do not see any good reason to intentionally visit the dungeon. It is 
more of a punishment than a reward.
