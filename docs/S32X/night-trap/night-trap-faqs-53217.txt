Notes before reading this document:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a) This document is a series of tables that show when action takes place within 
the eight rooms of the Martin summer home.  It also details the locations of 
the 95 augers and the necessary trap moments in order to finish the game.  It 
also describes the various endings the player can get, whether they win or 
lose.  The terminology used throughout the guide is authenticated by the Sega 
CD instruction manual for the game.

b) This document is protected by US Copyright Law, and the Berne Copyright 
Convention of 1976. This document is for private and personal use only--it 
cannot be reprinted in part or in whole or reproduced in any way or in any form

of commercial transaction, including selling it or giving it away as a gift.

d) This document is best read on a plain text reader.  Use a standard find 
feature to navigate the sections and to find exactly what you're looking for. 

e) This guide appears in plain text only at the GameFAQs website.  An 
interactive guide, optimized for game consoles and mobile devices, is 
available only at the following link:
http://www.christopherjhopkins.com/projects/gamefaqs/nighttrap.php

f) This FAQ began on April 24th, 2008 when I began to make a diagram of when 
events took place in the eight rooms of the game. For the next month, I charted 
the database information one room at a time, sitting in each room and waiting 
while other action took place elsewhere. The toughest part of this research was 
making sure to save the girls when absolutely necessary, which meant I had to 
leave the rooms when there could be activity in them. The numbers here have a 
margin of error of +-1 second. The traps that are necessary to complete the 
game are listed with the understanding that the player does capture the 
threatening person.

g) The Sega CD and PC/DOS versions have few major time differences between
them.  The biggest difference is a shift of one scene of five seconds so that
it would not be broken up over the disc change at approximately 00:13:26. The
PC/DOS version was made to be played in either Windows 95 or MS/DOS using the
same discs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Spellings:

The name of Dana Plato's character is spelled three different ways.  The 
Sega CD spells it as Kelly as found in the game's credits.  The PC/DOS 
version spells it as Kelli in the game's credits.  The Sega CD 
manual uses two alternate spellings.  When the manual introduces the character 
as SCAT's best undercover agent, it recognizes her as Keli Medd.  On the 
mission description, the manual from then on refers to her as Kelli with two 
l's similar to the PC/DOS version.   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Background/History:

To win/finish the game (achieve ending e), you must capture at least half of 
the augers and capture the eight necessary threats.  To win the game perfectly 
(achieve ending f), you must capture all 95 augers, capture the eight necessary 
threats, not capture Eddie nor the SCAT team members, and capture Jeff.

Night Trap Versions:

1988, Project NEMO (Never Even Mention Outside) - The orignial version was 
to be released on a VHS tape with multiple tracks for the aborted Hasbro 
system, the NEMO. Night Trap was filmed in the fall of 1987. This is the 
only version never released.

1992, Sega CD - considered to be the version with the poorest video quality, 
scenes were adjusted to incorporate Sega references and hardware (Sega 
Control Attack Team and the Sega Genesis joypad), during Lisa's capture 
sequence, you can see the blood extracted through the auger blood 
extraction grip, includes Easter Egg of NEMO meeting

1993, Sega CD - same as 1992 except Lisa's capture sequence is abridged, 
so Lt. Simms interrupts you before the blood extraction moment 

1994, 3DO - considered to be the version with the best video quality, all 
scenes intact, uses original footage of joypad and refers to SCAT as 
Special Control Attack Team before Sega changed it

1994, Sega 32X CD - Released a few months after the 3DO port, this required 
the Sega CD and the 32X. improves video quality of Sega CD, but not 
better than the 3DO,  same footage as 1992 version

1995, Windows & MS-DOS - same footage as 1992 version, used a new user 
interface with a map of the lakehouse during the pause screen, marketed 
as the Director's Cut, but no additional footage is available, the NEMO 
video is not present, also includes the "Dangerous Games" documentary about 
the 1992 United States Senate hearings, and interviews and accounts by 
Tom Zito, Robert Fulop, James Riley, and Dana Plato

1996, Macintosh - similar to the 1995 version

Night Trap is the first CD title with continuous full-motion video and audio as 
advertised on the back cover of the Sega CD casing.

Night Trap began as a short demo game called "Scene of the Crime" for the 
unreleased Hasbro NEMO system.  It would use VHS tapes as the medium for the 
games and would be able to instantly switch between different tracks all 
happening simultaneously in real time.  NEMO stands for "Never Even Mention 
Outside", a special code name. 

The Sega CD version of Night Trap contains 62.80 minutes of footage, 139.05 
minutes of dead time and 201.85 minutes of full video (00:24:10 *8+ 00:00:31 
for the ending scene in the Upstairs Hallway) in total. These numbers do not 
include alternate outcomes.

Night Trap: the Director's Cut does not have any additional scenes that
affect gameplay or the main plot.  The differences are in Commander Simms'
scenes in the SCAT van that do not make use of the Sega Genesis
controller.  The actor's tone is much calmer than found in the Sega CD
version where he breaks a Sega Genesis controller and reprimands you
in bad outcomes. 

The PC/DOS version contains a glitch within the game's timing routines 
which delays the timing of events. Faster computers will usually have the 
idle scenes ('dead time') speed by quicker than normal, which in turn 
conflicts with the timing for the later scenes. The only way to produce 
an authentic run with the console versions to run the game on older 
hardware with system requirements that match those around the time Night 
Trap was released.
 
In the PC/DOS version the story concludes with ending f every time, 
although you can't trap Kelly unless you did everything that you would 
normally need to do to activate that ending.

In all versions of Night Trap, the trap access code always begins the game 
as blue, and is chosen randomly while playing.  The PC/DOS version uses a 
predetermined sequence of code changes for every reboot without loading a 
saved game, so loading the same saved game will contain the same code changes 
each time.

Version 1.40 of this guide coincides with the 21st anniversary of the 
release of Night Trap for the Sega CD in its first appearance.  Night Trap 
was released on October 15, 1992 as a launch title for the Sega CD in North 
America.

6) Scene-By-Scene Description:
One of the concepts of a FMV interactive movie is the intermix of gameplay 
and cinematic story.  To truly understand the reason behind the gameplay
(the cameras and the traps), you must immerse yourself in the world of the 
game.  It is the evening.  Lt. Simms updates you on your position in the 
SCAT team.  Much like "Big Brother," you unravel the mystery of who the 
Martins are and what happened to the last set of girls who went there and 
never came back.  The events of the game mimic real life; when people leave 
one room, they enter another shortly after.  This Scene-By-Scene breaks down 
the action that occurs in the plot scenes and illustrates the story better.  
It should ultimately help you catch the augers as you understand how to 
follow important characters around the house so that the game does not end 
abruptly.  The disc change and an overlapping scene of a necessary trap 
moment are indicated in CAPITALIZATION.  Although the start and stop times 
are from the PC/DOS version, the Scene Numbers correspond to all versions of 
the game.

7) Endings:

How Many Endings Are There?
(a) If you don't press any buttons for the first 2 and a half minutes, 
Commander Simms tells you you're not up for this mission and disconnects you.
(b) If either Megan, Lisa, or Ashley get abducted by the augers or the 
Martins, Commander Simms reprimands you and disconnects you.  He may either 
pull the wire out of the Genesis controller or crack the controller in half.
(c) If Cindy or Kelly gets abducted by Jeff Martin, he bites her and takes 
her down to the basement where he finds out all about SCAT.  Jeff then 
disconnects the security override cable in the Downstairs Hallway and 
sends you into a trap in the kitchen.
(d) If either Sheila, Victor, or Sarah Martin is not captured in the final 
minute, the first Martin that is not captured will be the one who sucks Kelly's 
blood at the end.
(e) If you trap all the necessary threats and one of the following: miss at 
least one auger, trap Eddie or the SCAT team member, or not trap Jeff, Kelly 
tells you that you can do better next time and then an auger emerges as she 
walks down the stairs.
(f) If you capture all 95 augers, capture all necessary threats, do not capture 
Eddie nor the SCAT team member, then you get the perfect ending where Kelly 
tells you that nobody has ever been perfect.  Then the game allows you to trap 
Kelly in the Upstairs Hallway.  If you trap her, she complains that she thought 
she could count on you.  Otherwise, she will hop over the Upstairs Hallway trap 
floor and wave goodbye to you as she walks down the stairs.
(g) Although never appearing within the confines of the game, there is a 
seventh failing scenario in which Sheila Martin disconnects the player's 
controls after discovering the SCAT Team.  This clip can only be viewed using
a Sega CD Movie viewer on a Windows computer.  (Thanks to Harrison Moccio for 
sharing this ending.)
