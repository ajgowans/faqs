1) STORY

                       ONLY THE STRONGEST SURVIVE

In a frantic attempt to escape a lifetime of hard labor on an intersteller
mining project, a shipload of criminals have hijacked their prison barge
and used it to ram a military cruiser. The damage was extensive-only four
members of each ship survived.
The prison barge is completely useless. Power and life support on the
military cruiser are fading fast, and all the escape pods have been
destroyed, except one... and that pod has only room for one passenger.
Eight beings from eight different worlds, either criminals or
professional soldiers, are all desperate to survive. There is only one way
to determine who will escape and live, and who will die.

Your life depends on it.

2) CONTROL

-Pad Layout
Listed below are the eight basic D-Pad positions used in the game. These
positions are for when a character is facing RIGHT. Reverse the positions
for when a character is facing Left.


UB - U - UF                   (Z)
  \  |  /               (Y)
B -  N  - F  (-)  (X)            (C)
  /  |  \                  (B)
DB - D - DF          (A)


 [KEY]

UB = Up-Back
U  = Up
UF = Up-Forward
B  = Back
N  = Neutral
F  = Forward
DB = Down-Back
D  = Down
DF = Down-Forward


-Button Layout
Listed below is the default 6-Button Arcade Pad set-up.

   (X) - Light Punch
   (Y) - Light Kick
   (Z) - Provoke 1
   (-) - Start
   (A) - Fierce Punch
   (B) - Fierce Kick
   (C) - Provoke 2

Note to 3-Button Control Pad Users:
The default functions of Buttons (A), (B) and (C) are the Fierce Punch,
Fierce Kick and Provoke 2, but the type of attack produced depends on
the speed at which the button is PRESSED. 'TAP' either (A), (B) or (C)
Button quickly for a Light Attack. 'PRESS' either (A), (B) or (C)
Button for a Fierce Attack.

-Crawl
Every character in Cosmic Carnage is able to 'crawl' or crabwalk (as some
like to call it). To Crawl in Cosmic Carnage Press and Hold the D-Pad
either Down Back or Down Forward.

____________________________________________________________________________

3) GETTING STARTED
Following the SEGA logo is a breif game introduction, then the Title
screen appears. Press Start at any time to bring up the Game Menu.

-OPTIONS-
Select OPTIONS and press Start to bring up the Option menu. Highlight an
option by pressing the D-Pad up or down, and change features within a
highlighted option by pressing left or right, or select EXIT and press
any button.

-Difficulty: How tough do you want your opponents in the One Player game?
Level 1 is the easiest and level 5 is the hardest.

-Time Up: This sets a time limit on your battle. Turn this feature off
for an unlimited time match.

-Music/Sound FX Test: Use these features to play the background music and
the sound effects used in the game. Press the D-Pad left or right to
select the number of the track you wish to play, and press Button A, B,
C, X, Y or Z to play the music or sound effect.

-Controller Configuration: Customize the fuctions of the buttons on your
Control Pad. Select this feature and press Button A, B, C, X, Y or Z.
When the Configuration screen appears, press the D-Pad up or down to
highlight the desired function, then press the button you would like to
use for that function. To return to the Options screen, press Start, or
select EXIT and press any button.

-SELECT FIGHTER-
When you select a game and press Start, the Player Select screen appears.
Use the D-Pad to highlight the desired fighter, and press Start. In a One
Player game, the computer randomly chooses an opponent once you've chosen
a fighter. In a Two Player game, both players must select a fighter and
press Start to proceed to the next screen.

-SELECT your ARMOR-
The Parts Select screen appears next. If you chose one of the soldiers
(Tye, Naruto, Cylic or Zena-Lan), you select the armor you want your
fighter to wear. Press the D-Pad up or down to select the armor category
and press left or right to choose within that category. The special
attacks you can use depend on the armor your fighter is wearing. If you've
choosen one of the fugitives from the barge, the screen shows that no
armor is available. In a One Player game, the computer automatically
selects armor (if available) for your opponent. Press Start to begin your
match.

____________________________________________________________________________

4) The FIGHTERS
Those who wear armor have two types of special attacks: one for light
armor and one for heavy armor. The type of attack you can do depends on the
part your fighter uses to attack (arms, legs or body) and the type of armor
on that part.
All instructions are for when a character is facing RIGHT & with the
'Default 6-button'. Reverse the method for when a character is facing Left.

After the motions for the Special-Moves will be a small description (which
will be in "Quotation Marks"). This description will tell you if you can do
this move while in the Air/Jumping or whether or not it's an Air-Throw.

-Notes
The 4 Renegades (Talmac, Yug, Naja and Deamon) do not have the option
of selecting between Light & Heavy armor.
This can also be considered an 'Advantage' for them.. because they will
not lose any of their Special-Attacks as is the case with the Soldiers.


 TALMAC:

This tall, dark and sinister fugitive uses razor claws, has lightning
reflexes and powerful punches to hold his own in the arena. No one is
sure whether he is wearing a mask, or if that is his real face. No one
has gotten close enough to find out. Talmac does not use armor.

-Gale Wall: Press D, DB, B + (X) or (A). (reverses projectiles)

-Gale Wave: Press F, B, F + (X) or (A).

-Pile Dragon: Press F, D, DF + (X) or (A).

-Gale Arrow: Press and hold B, then F + (X) or (A).
========
 NAJA:

To defeat this serpintine siren, you must steer clear of her tail, a
weapon she uses as a battering ram, whip or vice. Naja doesn't need any
armor.

-Back Whip: Press and hold D, then U + (Y) or (B).

-Winder Rush: Press D, DB, B + (X) or (A). "Can perform
              this move while jumping"

-Tail Squeeze: contact your opponent and press (Y) or (B).
========
 YUG:

This gorilla-like humanoid relies almost entirely on his long, powerful
arms to deliver punishing hammer blows, bone-crushing holds and
devastating throws. He has a very long reach. Yug's armor is built in,
so he does not use additional armor.

-Spinning Double Strike: Press F, FD, D, DB, B + (X) or (A) twice.

-Blaze Hold: Press D, DF, F + (X) or (A).

-Strangle Hold: Grab your opponent with the Blaze Hold.. Then press and
                hold U + (X) or (A) repeatedly. This must be
                done quickly or Yug will not perform the move.

-Wheel Press: Grab your opponent with the Blaze Hold.. Then
              Press U, UF, F, FD, D + (X) or (A).


-Rolling Gangbuster: Grab your opponent with the Blaze Hold.. Then
                     Press B, F + (X) or (A).

========
 DEAMON:

Deamon is as vicious as he is ugly, and he enjoys using his natural
weapons to their best advantage. His long claws can tear an opponent to
bloody shreds, and that scorpion stinger attached to the back of his
isn't just for show. Deamon does not use armor.

-Whirling Thrasher: Press F, F + (X) or (A), then (Y) or (B).

-Hammerhead Whip: Press B, D, U + (X) or (A).

-Rolling Claw: contact your opponent and press (X) or (A).

____________________

-Notes
The Soldiers are already equiped wearing 'Light Armor'. You have the
option to equip them with 'Heavy Armor'. The Heavy Armor will make your
Soldier move Slower and will cut their Jumping in half.
Also keep in mind that when a Certain Armor part gets knocked off,
you will lose the move which pertained to that part of the body.
Before I forget, moves that are 'Both Armor Styles' can be performed
both with or without Armor.

The 'Layout' for the Soldiers is going to be a little different in
that you'll see a letter following the name of the Special-Move.
This letter will let you know which body armor part you'll need to
perform that Special-Move.

[KEY]

<A> = Arms
<B> = Body
<L> = Legs

The chart below is how the Layout is going to look for the Soldiers.
An example is given with 1 of 'Cylics' Special-Moves:


      (Body Armor needed to perform Special-Move)
                        _/
                       | |
  "Machine Gun Knuckle <A>: F, D, DF + (X) or (A)."
  |___________________|    |_____________________|
               \                        \
     (name of Special-Move)              \
                               (motion for Special-Move)


 TYR:

A master designer of weapons and bodysuits, Tyr has saved the best
designs for himself. He uses the weight and power of his armor to support
devastating charges and body slams. His drop throws are lethal.

5) FATALITIES

The Fatalities in Cosmic Carnage are simple and are identicle for every
character in how you perform/execute them and what happens to either you
or your foe. You must finish/beat your opponent on the Final Round using
a Special-Attack (its that simple), Special-Throws will not count as a
Fatality. It doesn't matter which Special-Attack you use or if you/they
are in the Air or on the Ground. If you or your opponent are blocking and
get Knocked Out in the final round then a Fatality will not happen. 1 of
3 things will happen to either you or your opponent:

1) - Your/Their 'Head' will explode.

2) - Your/Their 'Arms' will be cut off.

3) - You'll/They'll be 'Cut in Half' at the waist.

____________________________________________________________________________

6) COMBOS

As awkward? alright "BAD"... as the control in Cosmic Carnage is, there
are many decent Combos....for Certain Characters at least:

[Talmac]
2 Hits - Crouching (X), Gale Wall
3 Hits - Jump-In (B), crouching (B)
3 Hits - Jump-In (B), crouching (X), Gale Wall

[Naga]
2 Hits - Jump-In (B), crouching (B)

[Yug]
2 Hits - Standing (A), Blaze Hold + Wheel Press
3 Hits - Standing (A), Spinning Double Striker
3 Hits - Jump-In (A), standing (A), Blaze Hold + Strangle Hold
4 Hits - Jump-In (A), standing (A), Spinning Double Strike

-Notes
As you know after playing Cosmic Carnage the Control is EXTREMELY Picky.
The combos do WORK, you just have to get familiarized with the 'Timing' of
your normal attacks.

____________________________________________________________________________

7) CYBER BRAWL

In Japan Cosmic Carnage is known as Cyber Brawl. In Cyber Brawl three of
the four soldiers were Human, while the same four soldiers were changed
or illustrated differently for Cosmic Carnage to look like Aliens/Freaks.
Mortal Kombat was highly ripped on by several organizations for it's
fatality moves which these groups considered 'Barbaric' and 'InHumane'.
By doing this form of Censoring you're not doing these fatality moves to
a Human, you're just doing it to an Alien. Something they forgot to change
is the 'Blood' color, While the YUG's Blood is a yellow-brown hue the
Soldier's Blood is...you guessed it....RED.
Sega most likely Re-illustrated the Soldiers because when they get their
Armor knocked off they're pretty much in their underwear, and you know how
'some' people feel about that. I don't know? That's just my 2-cents.

CYBER BRAWL Code:

Before turning on your 32X, hold buttons X, B & Z, then press the Start
button at the introduction.

-Note: You'll need a 6-Button controller for this code to work.
