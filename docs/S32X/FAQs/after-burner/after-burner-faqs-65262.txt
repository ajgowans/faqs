      INTRODUCTION
o---------------------o

Can you believe it? This is my 30th FAQ for the Sega Master System Completion
Project. The ice dynasty continues though I've kind of slowed down a bit due to
a little burnout from September and being busy with school and taking care of my
little ice princess but I do have time to get in another FAQ for the masses and
the project.

Lucky number 30 goes to After Burner which is a cult classic for all ages no
matter what platform. In this game you fly through 18 stages over the sea to get
the missions done. It's no piece of cake. There is an enemy that is tough as
nails and this guide will not necessarily guarantee you'll beat the game.

         STORY
o---------------------o

You're a Navy Air Captain. At your control is the most advanced fighter jet ever
to set the sky on fire! You supply the skill, reflexes, and guts. Your F14 Thun-
der Cat gives you Mach 2+ speeds, unlimited firepower and a state-of-the-art 
battle computer which targets your enemies for destruction. Fire guided miss-
iles, then blast away with your Vulcan cannon. Roll your F-14 left and right!
Enemy missiles slide under your wings. Your afterburners roar as you dive for
the wave tops! In this sky battle you're outnumbered. But that's O.K. When it
comes to flying the unfriendly skies, you're the one they call "The Ace."

       CONTROLS
o---------------------o

D-pad = I'll warn you now that up and down are inverted while left and right are
still the same. That means press up on the d-pad to go up and down on the d-pad
to go up.

1 Button = Shoot Missiles

2 Button = Shoot Vulcan Cannon

You can do a barrel roll by holding the direction left/right then jerk it into
the opposite direction.

       GAMEPLAY
o---------------------o

-You start out with three lives and you can earn more by scoring enough points
 but if you run out of lives, the game is over. However, you hold Up and press
 1 & 2 simultaneously then you can continue where you left off up to three times
 but your score will reset. It won't work after the 8th level.

-There is a code to have unlimited continues. At the title screen, press the
 Pause button on the console 100 times and then you can continue as usual. The
 good part is that you can use it till the end of the game.

-Occasionally through the game you will have a bonus chance to gain points by
 successfully refueling. Unlike Top Gun, you will not really die from lack of
 fuel. It's just bonus points.

-Enemies coming from behind cannot hurt you. But missiles can.

-The best way to deal with missiles is to either shoot them or let them get
 close to you then tilt to the side so that the missile flies under you. It also
 works on most homing missiles. Always remember to stay mobile and you won't get
 hit. 

-The Flying Fortresses cannot be harmed by your Vulcan Cannon. There are three
 spot on the back of it that you can destroy with your missiles. Once all three
 are destroyed it is shot down. You fight them every 6 levels and they get a bit
 stronger each time.

-Barrel rolling is highly unwise for the most part. You can use it mostly for
 style but you are a sitting duck if the enemy is shooting because you can't
 move during the barrel roll.

-After defeating the first two Flying Fortresses, you will see the Thundercat
 land to get some new fuel. Along the way, it looks like the Thundercat will
 give chase first to a motorcycle and then to a car. The last Flying Fortress
 will have the Thundercat land on the airstrip and you get a message that says
 MISSION COMPLETE!

-Always be sure to shoot the enemies coming at you the moment you see them as
 they will are a bigger threat that enemies coming from behind.

-The NES version of this game is created by Tengen and it does not contain the
 Flying Fortresses. Instead, you will have a few bonus stages where you won't
 be able to steer or shoot. You will get 70 missiles from the trip. Some of the
 levels have buildings and walls that you can crash into. There are 23 levels as
 opposed to 18.

Here are some Game Genie codes if the game is too tough for you to handle:

C91-09D-19D + 180-ADC-4CA + C91-24C-19D: Immune to missiles
C9B-56D-91D: Immune to Kamikaze

Here are action replay codes: 

00C0-1809: Infinite Lives
00C0-17??: Levels (?? = number of level)
