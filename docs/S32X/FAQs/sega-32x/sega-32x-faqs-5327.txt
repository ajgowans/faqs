1.0) So what is the 32X?
------------------------

The 32X was released in late November 1994 in the United States, with
releases in other countries following in the coming months. What the
32X is an addon for existing Genesis/Megadrive owners, which, when
plugged into the cartridge port of the machine, provides extra proces-
sing power, graphical enhancement and other improvements over your old 
machine. 

The 32X is a cartridge and CD's based system, and is not be upgradeable 
to the Saturn(which was first planned with the Jupiter). The 32X also 
include less of the specially designed processors than the Saturn, 
allowing it to be released at a very much cheaper price.

For those who own a SegaCD the 32X will take advantage of this to 
provide 32X CD games. If you have a SegaCD it will use the extra capa-
bilities of the machine, in addition to that of the Genesis and itself. 
The reason for this seems to be so that Sega can boost sales of the
SegaCD, while also cutting prices on the 32X by not having to include
a CD-drive. 

How did this come about? Most believe that Sega initially was at work
on a cartridge only machine, however due to the market pressure of CD
becoming standard, Sega was persuaded to integrate CD storage into
their machine. Rather than waste this technology, they opted to use 
some of the technology in a cheaper, less powerful console that could
remain competitive for several years, well at least for three years...

1.5) History of the 32X Mars: (by Barry Cantin)
-----------------------------------------------
The Sega 32X was designed during 1993-94 by Sega of America primarily 
for use in the North American and European markets. The Japanese were 
about to get the Sega Saturn 32-bit system, and Sega felt (wisely) that 
there wasn't enough room in the Japanese video game market for two Sega 
32-bit systems. So, the system was developed in the U.S. with some 
follow-up work done in Japan. The Sega 32X unit was unveiled during 
"Sega Gamer's Day", June 2, 1994, at Sega's Headquarters in San Francisco.
Sega showed demos of early 32X titles, including "Doom", "Star Wars 
Arcade", "Ecco the Dolphin", "Super Motocross", "Virtua Racing Deluxe", 
"Super After Burner", and "Fahrenheit"(on CD). (Note that Ecco 32X was 
never released)

November, 1994 - Sega of America released the 32X unit. SRP was $159.99, 
and did not include a pack-in. On the day of the system's launch, no 
titles were available, either.  A few days later, Sega released "Doom", 
"Star Wars Arcade", and "Virtua Racing Deluxe". Shortly after that two 
additional titles made it to store shelves: "Cosmic Carnage" and "Metal 
Head".

The Sega 32X was released in Europe as well, and in Japan as the "Super 
32X" for use with the Mega Drive systems. The design was essentially the 
same for all three types of machines. Although there was talk of a combo 
Genesis/32X machine to be released in Japan, it never materialized.

Blockbuster Video stores also began to carry the 32X and games for rental.  
Some hype was generated at these stores with a free rental of a 32X 
"preview" video in the months leading up to the unit's release.
Several third-party developers were brought on board to create 32X games, 
including Acclaim, Accolade, Activision, Core Design, and EA Sports.  
Thirty-six games were eventually released for the system, including five 
CD titles, from 1994-96.  The majority of those games were from Sega.
The Sega 32X was sold initially with no pack-in, but later releases 
included three different titles:

1995: Star Wars pack-in 
1995: Doom pack-in
1996: Virtua Fighter pack-in

The 32X saw decent sales for a relatively brief period of time; however, 
many people did not want to buy the system with Sega's upcoming Saturn 
system just over the horizon.  Sega insisted that they would continue 
to support the 32X even after the Saturn was released in 1995. The 32X 
underwent several price cuts from 1995-96, in an attempt to boost sagging 
32X unit sales.  Several hits were released for the 32X, including 
"Mortal Kombat 2" and "Virtua Fighter"(which was preceded by the "Virtua 
Fighter Training Pack", consisting of a VF T-shirt, a video tape with 
some VF info/strategies, and coupons toward its purchase). Still, the 
public saw the Saturn as Sega's true next-gen system, and began aban-
doning the 32X pretty quickly. The last title to be released for the 
32X was "Spiderman: Web of Fire" (Sega), in spring 1996.

In 1996, Sega discontinued support for the 32X in favor of the Saturn.  
This was not a great shock to anyone, since the number of titles had 
slowed to a trickle earlier that year. During late 1996-1997, several 
large chain stores including Toys R Us and Electronics Boutique started 
discounting the 32X system as low as $19.99 (base system). Most of the 
games had also been discounted to less than $20 each.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5) The 32X Neptune System:
----------------------------

Sega's decision to lunch a mutated 32X/Genesis had almost seen the day,
but was canceled with the arrival of another 32-bit system: the Sega 
Saturn! Sega had admitted that the 32X was a little too expensive at the
time so the idea of putting a 32X & a Genesis alltogether and releasing
it with a better price was their idea, well the idea vanished faster than
the speed of light.

so if somebody out there wants a Sega Neptune, you better be damn rich
since it only exist one prototype. Better yet, don't think about it...

If anybody wants to see a picture of the Neptune, please go to my web 
site at: "http://slydc.encomix.es/32x.htm", Thanks!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.0) The 32x in other Countrys:
-------------------------------

The 32X was released in Japan in a low key launch, even despite the 
Genesis relative lack of popularity in that country. The 32X is also 
available in Europe (aka Mega 32X), Australia, and Canada in limited 
numbers. It was also released in Japan (called the Super 32X) with 
very few games due to lack of popularity of the Megadrive console. 
Any more info anyone ???

The lockout chips/compatability for the European, North American, and 
Asian machines remains incompatible with each other respectively. 
These machines will a combination of hardware 'lock-key' mechanisms to
prevent uncontrolled importing. These may eventually be circumnavigated 
through the use of converters, as used in the past by some companies. 

Here are the 2 games European-only:
-----------------------------------
* Darxide (Shooter) [from Rocket Science]
* FIFA Soccer '96 (Sports) [from Electronics Arts]

4.5) More Inputs:
-----------------

The 32X was released in the United States in late November, 1994 and  
finally had been dicountinued late 1995 due to the early arrival of 
the Sega Saturn in the summer of 1995.
  
Sega was trying to provide some type of upgrade path to the Saturn so
that it can play existing 32X games, however there is a definite
technological difference that makes this difficult. When implemented,
this will be through an optional plug-in cartridge that will allow
you to play not only 32X games, but also Genesis, and SegaCD games on
your Saturn.

Sega claimed on the 32X packaging that it will not work with the CDX, 
essentially because FCC approval for this combination was never received. 
However, if you connect the 32X to your CDX, it works fine. (NOTE: The 
author assumes NO responsibility for any damages or losses incurred for 
anything suggested here, and neither does Sega of America... if you try 
this, you do so at your own risk).

Chaz Bocock wrote to me about 2 prototype games. Here's what:
Judge Dredd and Virtua Hamster. I'll tell you what I know about these games..

JUDGE DREDD : A friend of mine wrote the PC version of this game, and saw the
prototype of the 32X version.  The only difference between the 32X version
and the Megadrive version, is the flying level (on the hoverbikes), the
background to this is a mode-7 type affect.

VIRTUA HAMSTER : This was going to be a 'Hamsters and other animals on
power skateboards' - 'Turtles' style.  The creatures would race down a
series of 3D Tunnels/Tubes.  The only work that was completed on this
games was a rendered mock-up of what the game would like, plus a small
intro.  It never got further than this.

Sean Kelly (the multi-game cart maker) wrote to me if i knew any proto-
type games. I've told him that i only knew these proto games: 
Judge Dredd, Virtua Hamster, Ecco & Surgical Strike CD. (2 described
above). He told me that he has these prototypes games...Virtua Hamster,
X-Men & Tempo, the lucky guy!! But many of you know that Tempo was released
but prototype games of released games can exist, like Terminator 2 for the
NES of Thunderground for the Atari 2600. Wonder if the Tempo proto is the
same thing as the released one....hummm.

Here's a suggestion from Jon Folkers (Manic Butt):
This looks like a good place to insert some of the FAQs about stereo sound 
when hooking this beast up to different model Genesis machines. I know I 
was pissed when I found out my sound output HAD to be mono unless I used 
headphones.

Some of this is in the 32X manual, but could be excerpted for people who 
bought used and didn't get instructions -- the rest is at
http://www.sega.com/support/troubleshoot/.

I agree with Jon, so since i didn't had much time to write a chapter on
how to hook-up the 32X in stereo or anything else in the instruction
manual of the 32X, i'll will make a chapter for the manual for everybody
who doesn't have or didn't get the manual. So wacth out for the next
version, thanks for your patient until then!

Are you having problems to finish a game or any trouble, please go
to this site: "http://vgstrategies.miningco.com/msub32x.htm".
Just say to Al Amaloo that i sent you !
