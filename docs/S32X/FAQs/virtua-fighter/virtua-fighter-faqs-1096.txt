What's New
-----------------------

This section of the FAQ is exactly what its name says.  It's a summary of 
some of the changes to this updated version of the FAQ in a quick reference 
way so you to know what to look for as you peruse the guide.

Changes from 3.1:
Names of Fighting Styles added.
Playing as Dural.
Jeffry's Body Press corrected (Was Back, Back+Punch; Now Back+Punch only)
Two player games with the same colored characters.
Sarah's Knee & Rising Knee combo added.

Additions from 3.0:
A strategy section for kicking opponents in the back of the head
Short Hopping Jab and Karate Chops for all characters
Akira & Pai -- Repeated Ground Punches
Kage -- Hopping Jab/Sweep Combo
Color coding of Difficulty Settings
A rumor has also surfaced about VF2 being field tested in Japan.  (Always 
take rumors with a grain of salt, though....)

Additions from 2.7:
Jeffry -- Knee/Rushing Uppercuts Combo

Changes from 2.7:
Headers revised to be (hopefully) more readable

rated SOLELY by the power of the move.  The rating is an approximate 
percentage of damage done.

The character strategy guide has been edited and altered to reflect new 
moves and info.

The Virtua Fighter complete guide is now the largest FAQ for a single video 
game on the internet!  Congratulations guys on all the 
moves/strategies/things to talk about we've gotten started for this great 
game.

Definitions
-----------------------

vir tu a (ver'chu a), slang for virtual

vir tu al (ver'chu al), adj. for all practical purposes, actual, real 
fighter (fi'ter), n. 1) a person or thing that fights 2) a person who 
participates in a violent struggle; combat or conflict; battle; contest.

vir tu a  fight er (ver'chu a  fi'ter),n. 1) a person who, for all practical 
purposes is actually participating in a real battle or contest 2) One of the 
baddest one on one fighting  games to hit the streets whose breathtaking 
polygon graphics and genuine martial arts moves are sure to captivate 
players all across the globe.
 
-----------------------
Introduction
-----------------------

Different is good.

Lately, gamers have been hit pretty hard by a barrage of fighting games 
ranging from those whose only draw is blood and guts to those who resemble a
sick horse that should be humanely shot or at least taken to a hospital for 
a few years....

With the release of their first ever fighting game, Sega has broken new 
ground by designing the only current martial arts game whose draw isn't 
violence or the ever popular 'magic' moves, but whose draw is realism, 
fluidity of motion, and genuine martial art techniques.

The ability to so successfully meet these goals is due to Sega's System 1 
polygon graphics engine which is much like the system  used in their popular 
Virtua Racer.  This system can handle over 180,000 flat shaded polygons per 
second, and since the fighters are three-dimensional figures made of 
polygons instead of just flat images, be prepared to be dazzled by more than 
just the backgrounds.

As for the game itself, Virtua Fighter plays like other recent fighting 
games in some respects.  There are 8 characters to choose from, and the 
basic object of the game is to, through the use of punches, kicks, throws, 
grabs, pounces, and a variety of other techniques, drain your opponent's 
life meter. The problem is that at this point Virtua Fighter already shows 
its differences from other fighting games because you can also win by 
knocking your opponent out of the ring.  Another difference is that Virtua 
Fighter has many more special moves than any previous fighting game; there 
are over 100 secret techniques to discover.  Not to mention that it just 
feels more like a real battle due to the fluid motion and realistic moves.

Needless to say, Virtua Fighter is destined to be remembered as both a great 
one on one martial arts game and a spectacular fighting simulator.  If you 
haven't seen one yet, then go check it out at your local arcade.

Otherwise, check out the moves and strategies in this FAQ and then use them 
to help you master this exciting game before someone else gets ahead of you.

-----------------------
Getting Started
-----------------------

-----------------------------
FIRST - How to win the match
-----------------------------


The winner is the first player to win 3 sets.

NOTE: Virtua Fighter can be adjusted so that the winner wins after winning 
2, 3, 4, or 5 sets.  On 2, the winner must win 2 out of 3 sets.  On 3, he 
must win 3 out of 5, and so on.  Factory setting is two sets, but this goes 
much too fast.  Four or five is much too long.  Three sets is where the game 
plays best for the gamer and still earns well for the operator.  If your 
Virtua Fighter is not put on 3 sets, talk to your local arcade manager about 
having him do so, for it only takes a few seconds to change over.


-----------------------------
SECOND- How to win a set
-----------------------------

1)      By KO
2)      By a 'Ring Out'
3)      By a 'Time Out'

KO- so thoroughly pulverizing your opponent that you completely drain his 
life meter.

Ring Out- somehow or other knocking your opponent out of the 'ring' that you 
are fighting in.

Time Out- each round lasts only 30 seconds, so if you are ahead, it might be 
to your advantage to just let the last few seconds tick away, and win by 
decision.

-----------------------------
THIRD- Terminology
-----------------------------

Term     Meaning             As in
----------------------------------
VF       Virtua Fighter      The game this FAQ is about

*        A new move          A move new to this revision


-----------------------------
FOURTH- The buttons
-----------------------------

WHEN YOU ARE STANDING

PUNCH - Steps forward with a punch
        Repeat for multiple punches

KICK -  A kick to the head
        Not too powerful or effective

DEFEND- Blocks your opponent's STANDING and JUMPING attacks
        You take no damage from such attacks.
        Crouching attacks do damage.
        You are still pushed backwards
        Some special moves can be done while defending


WHEN YOU ARE CROUCHING:

PUNCH - Low punch; Hits standing defenders
        Stays in one place; quite weak and ineffective

KICK -  Low kick to the knee; very weak; Hits standing defenders
        Longer reach than a crouching punch, but slower

DEFEND - Defends against all crouching attacks, and ducks under many
         standing attacks; some standing attacks and most jumping
         attacks will still hit.

All moves that can be done while holding the defend button are marked with a 
{D}.
All moves that will hit a standing defender are marked with an {S}.
All moves that will hit a crouching defender are marked with a {C}.


-----------------------------
FIFTH- JUMPING
-----------------------------

TYPES OF JUMPS

1) Long distance jump  Hold jump {D}


JUMPING ATTACKS

Name                 Motion
------------------------------------------
Hopping Karate Chop  Tap Jump and Punch {D}
Hopping Jab          Tap Jump, Tap Up+Punch in air {D}
Overhead hammer      Hold Jump, For+Pun {D}
Jumping kick         Hold Jump+Kick {D}
Hop kick             Tap Jump+Kick {D}
Drop Kick Forward    Hold Jump,For+Kick {D}
Drop Kick Behind     Hold Jump,Back+Kick {D}

Short jumping attacks work OK, but the punches & kicks come out in almost 
slow motion, and you can easily be knocked down by any attack from your 
opponent.

Short jumping attacks are the only jumping attacks which can hit a crouching 
opponent.

Kage has two types of drop kicks, depending on distance.


COLLISION IN MID AIR

Will usually just push both players away from each other, & neither one will 
hit the other.


JUMPING WHILE BLOCKING

all jumping attacks can be done while holding defense
this can be especially helpful when doing an in close distance jumping kick


---------------------------------
SIXTH- Running and all that Jazz
---------------------------------

Name                       Motion
-------------------------------------------------------
Step Forward Quickly       For, Tap For
Step Backward Quickly      Back, Back
Run Forward                For, Hold For
Turning around             Tap or hold towards opponent
Turn around punch or kick  Attack

NOTE: defense doesn't work when you are facing backwards


-----------------------------------------
SEVENTH- Crouching, Standing, and Throws
-----------------------------------------

NOTE:   There is a real difference between "," and "+" in this FAQ.
Especially when in conjunction with a downward movement.  For example, "D+K" 
must be done as a tap to the joystick down and simultaneously pressing the K 
button.  On the other hand, a "D, K" could be done by tapping the joystick 
down and pressing K or also by holding the joystick down and then pressing 
the K button.

This is only most notably important in the snap kicks, backflips, and 
kickflips which require a tap of the joystick in conjunction with possibly 
pressing the button.

All throws assume that you are standing next to your opponent.  Some throws 
require that you're opponent be crouching.

ALL throws can be done to an opponent who is defending
SOME throws can be done while you are defending


-----------------------------
EIGHTH- Replays
-----------------------------

At the end of every set, the computer will replay the last 3 seconds or so 
of the fight, and then the winner will do his victory pose.  This is a 
really cool feature, but may soon get irritating.  
Sega, realizing the positive/negative aspects of such a feature, was smart 
enough to add a way to skip past the replay by simply hitting the START 
button.  This way, you can still watch the replays if you had an especially 
exciting finish, or you can just hit start and immediately go on 
to the next set.

Finally now, the moves...

Character Moves' Ratings
------------------------------------

This section rates and lists the best of each character's special moves, 
throws, and combos.  The rating in parentheses is an approximate percentage 
of the life bar lost from the move.

Some of the combinations listed include Pouncing on the downed opponent.  If 
the Pounce is listed, it means that the Pounce is very likely to hit if done 
quickly.

Keep in mind that although the moves below are effective ways of demolishing 
an opponent, you will need to learn to use the basic punches and kicks as 
well to become a true champion.  The best strategy in any fighting game is, 
after all, a flexible one.

Below the name of the move is how to do it in abbreviated notation.

General Fighting Techniques
------------------------------------

This part of the guide will hopefully help you to get a head start on 
learning some of the basic fighting techniques.  It tells how each style 
works, advantages & disadvantages, and sometimes a way to counter it if 
someone is using it against you.  They are listed in the order of their 
complexity or importance.  Don't use any one of these techniques too much, 
because a mixed style is the best technique that you can possibly use.

First off, though, realize that VF is mainly a GROUND game.  In its attempt 
to be as close to real fighting as possible, Sega chose to make air attacks 
fairly worthless.  Some arts, like Tae Kwon Do, do deal with a certain 
amount of air attacking, but generally speaking, most martial arts teach 
solely ground techniques.  You'll have a hard time trying to find a 
tournament with as many people jumping around as you do in any of the SF2 
clones.

Therefore, expect to keep a lot of your game on the ground, but by all 
means, don't expect this fact to limit VF's game playing variety or fun in 
any way.  It only makes the game more realistic.

Now then, the techniques...

------------------------------------
A FLURRY OF JABS
------------------------------------

By simply tapping the punch button repeatedly, your character, whomever he 
(or she) may be, will step forward and punch as they go.  They will punch 2-
3 times and then pause for a second before they can begin to attack again.

Works good...

when your enemy has very little life left. 
When your enemy is close to the edge of the ring (to get a 'ring out')
sometimes to start the round out with if they are in the air, you can 
usually hit them with an attack, and follow that up with two or three 
punches before they hit the ground Jeffry, Lau, and Wolf can tag on their 
uppercut/knife hand to make a more deadly combo whenever they catch someone 
in the air with a punch or a kick if you tag on the kick part of their 
combos.

Works bad...

if you use it too much to start the round out too much with it since your 
opponent can just start his round out with a jumping kick and hit you before 
you can start punching.


------------------------------------
SHORT JUMPING ATTACKS
------------------------------------

Pretty much worthless against any decent opponent.  OK if you can catch them 
off guard, but they still don't do much damage.  The jumping straight up 
attacks seem to work the best since they let you jump above a sweep or low 
punch, and then clobber the sucker on the head.  Short jumping attacks, 
though, are the only jumping attacks which are able to hit a crouching 
opponent.

------------------------------------
DISTANCE JUMPING ATTACKS

------------------------------------

Jumping and kicking immediately works well if they are really close to you.  
You can catch them off guard if they are closing in with a fury of jabs.
This attack also hits a crouching defender.  Therefore it is very valuable 
to people who don't have many other attacks which can hit a crouching 
opponent.  For Pai, in particular, she only has the shuffle side kick and 
this jumping kick.

If they aren't close, then you have three options.

Double footed kick:

Has deceptive range.  Probably the best distance attack.  You must hit the 
kick button before you reach the peak of your jump.  You can only be hit out 
of it if your opponent does a close jumping kick before your kick comes 
out... and that is a very hard move to time.

Pai will do some sort of foot stomp
Sarah will do a single legged kick
Kage will do a flip, turned into a kick

Mid air kick

If you hit the kick as you are coming down instead of hitting it early, 
you'll get a weak sort of 
kick with no range.

Overhead hammer:

You need to hit the punch button before you reach the peak of your jump.  
Better than the mid air 
kick, but not as good as the double footed kick.

Jumping attacks can sometimes connect, but they work best only as a 
desperation move since you 
are so vulnerable to being hit.


------------------------------------
RING OUT
------------------------------------

Knocking your opponent out of the ring is a perfectly legitimate way to win 
a set.  The simplest way to accomplish this is, when they are close to the 
edge, to use a fury of jabs or a sweep since these attacks will push them 
backwards even if they defend.

Note that Kage's flying kick pushes people back very far, and that Wolf's 
spinning throw can throw the person out of the ring if you are lucky :)  for 
that, try to have your back to the edge since that is the direction that he 
finally lets them fly.


------------------------------------
WAITING FOR YOUR BREAK
------------------------------------

One of the more successful defenses can be to simply just crouch and sit 
below your opponents attacks until they pause in their attack.  You can then 
counter with one of the following.


A Power Move

Like Kage's heel kick, Wolf's Shoulder Ram or Akira's double motion snap 
kick.


A Throw

Just perform the motion for the throw you would like to do.  Characters are 
easy targets for 
throws while they recover from moves such as high kicks and missed pounces 
and jumps.


A Combo

Like Jacky's elbow, heel kick combo or Sarah's elbow, knee combo


------------------------------------
KICKING AS YOU STAND UP
------------------------------------
If your opponent knocks you down and then walks up next to you as you lay on 
the ground, tap kick as you get up and you will immediately do a sweep, a 
roundhouse, or a double feet first kick to the head region as you stand up, 
hopefully catching them off guard.  Any of these kicks will hit your 
opponent if he's not defending, but each one also has a priority over 
certain defend stances as well.

A sweep hits a standing person -- Hold Down,Tap Kick

A roundhouse hits a crouching or jumping person -- Tap Kick
The kick will appear differently depending on where the opponent is in 
relation to your head on the ground.  If the opponent is behind you, the 
fighter will do a rear kick or double footed up-side down kick similar to 
the roundhouse.

Or, if you don't want to try for a sweep you can roll backwards, and get 
yourself away from the action by simply tapping Back before you stand up.

If you are close to the edge of the ring, or you have some other reason to 
get to the side of your opponent, hit Defense and you will roll to the side 
of your attacker.  Tap defense quickly to get up faster.  This may possibly 
open you up for a good attack since your opponent will not be facing 
straight on.  You can also do a roll to the side with a sweep by hitting 
Defend, Kick after you land.  You need to wait a second after you hit, or it 
may not come out right.

If you are playing someone who is fairly good, they will not usually stay 
close to you after they knock you down, so don't expect to get too many 
kicks in.

If you have knocked your opponent down, and are expecting him to try to kick 
you as he gets up, there are some things you can do to counter his kicks if 
you can outguess him.  If you anticipate...

A sweep -- you do a short jump straight up with a punch or kick, and hit him 
as you jump over his sweep.  Beware of a sweep after the opponent rolls to 
the side....  Elbows also hit.

A roundhouse -- you do a sweep

A rear kick -- defend, don't try anything


------------------------------------
HIT 'EM WHILE THEY'RE DOWN
------------------------------------

NEARLY every time you knock your opponent down you should try for a stomp...

To do a basic stomp, simply tap Up+Punch.  To do a slower, but more damaging 
stomp, tap Up and Hold Punch (NOTE: Akira has only the lighter stomp.  Do 
not hold punch with Akira).

The pounces in which you hold Up are all slower, but they do inflict more 
damage.  Make sure you have enough time to land on your opponent if you 
choose to do a slower stomp.

Each character has their stomps described below with holding and tapping 
punch. 
 Note that Akira can do his Jumping Punch only if he taps up, and that 
Kage's three pounces vary with distance, not with holding or tapping.

Name       Tap Up+Punch         Hold Up+Punch
Akira      Jumping Punch        -None-
Jacky      Low Jumping Hammer   Higher Jumping Hammer
Jeffry     Splash               Butt Bomb

Kage       Head Dive(close)     same
           Feet-First (medium)  same
           Knee Dive (far)      same
Lau        Single Stomp         Double Stomp
Pai        Low Knees            Higher Knees
Sarah      Low Jumping Hammer   Higher Jumping Hammer
Wolf       Low Jumping Elbow    High Jumping Elbow
Akira and Pai can do their normal stomp, and they can also simply bend over 
and punch their opponent repeatedly on the ground by alternately pressing 
Down/For +Punch and Down/For.  Timing is critical to obtain multiple hits on 
the ground.



------------------------------------
KICKFLIPPING
------------------------------------

All the characters except for Akira, Jeffry, and Wolf can backflip.  Those 
who can backflip can do a type of attack called kickflipping, which is a 
high backwards flip in which the legs can hit the opponent and do major 
damage besides looking just totally cool.

To perform a kick flip with these characters, tap Back/Up+Kick.
Kage can perform a kickflip as well as a back handspring with double foot 
kick.


Kage, Lau, Pai, and Sarah can do kickflip combos by going P,P,P,B/U+K.
Sarah can also do on with only two punches.

Some hints for future kickflippers --
Works best to wait for your opponent to walk towards you, totally unaware of 
the disaster that awaits them, and then kickflip them at the last second
it also works well when your opponent is jumping in at you.


------------------------------------
STAB 'EM IN THE BACK
------------------------------------

If your opponent jumps over you, or somehow get turned around, run at them 
as soon as you can (if you have a known back side throw).  As you are still 
running, execute the move for your throw, and you'll grab them before they 
even have a chance to turn around :)

Note, though, that you can not run at a person and grab them on the front as 
easily as you can on the back side.

This can be a dangerous attack since your opponent can do a turn around 
attack by simply pressing either punch or kick... but if you're quick 
enough, you can get to them before they can do a turn around attack.


------------------------------------
Feints
------------------------------------

There are many type of feints in VF.  Below are summarized a few that you 
can use to take your opponent off guard.


Pulling back a kick
------------------------------------
To pull back a kick, press the kick button, and then press the DEF button 
before your kick has been raised above your knee.  What you do after that is 
up to you, but your opponent will probablly block.  This will give you an 
opportunity to strike w/ a {C} or {S} attack depending on how they defend.


Don't finish out a double/triple motion move
------------------------------------
That is to say, do only a double kick for Sarah's triple kick, or only do 
one Backfist for Jacky.  If you've been doing a lot of double/triple motion 
moves in prior rounds, this can be a very effective tactic.  As they are 
defending, expecting the next move, hit them w/ a {C} or {S} again.

Do a different combo/double motion move that looks simmilar Switch from 
using Lau's 3 punch sweep to his crescent to his kickflip.  Start doing 
Sarah's triple kick instead of just a double kick.  
Do Jacky's double roundhouse.  The key is to keep mixing things up, and if a 
move looks a lot like anothermove that you have, then mix those two up 
especially.


------------------------------------
Punch and Throw Techniques
------------------------------------
If an opponent tends to try to close distance with you by move forward, try 
punch and throwing him.  Do a single punch, crouching or standing, followed 
QUICKLY by the motion for the throw you want to do.  If the punch connects, 
there is a good chance they will still be in range for a throw.  "Heavy" 
fighters, such as Jeffry and Wolf, are particularly vulnerable, since the 
punch will hardly move them at all.

The punch is fast enough to interrupt any attack the opponent may be 
attempting, and the throw if done correctly will come out while they are 
still reeling from the punch.  Even if the opponent blocks, the throw will 
connect so long as you are close enough.

Typical Punch & Throw techniques are Kage's Punch&Toss (P,B+P), Wolf's Punch 
& Twirl (P,B,D,F+P) and Lau's Punch&Face Slam (P,B,F+P).

As a final note, try doing Jeffry's ultimate combo: the Toe Kick&Piledriver 
combination (D+K,D,F/D,F+ALL).  With a follow-up pounce it automatically 
kills any opponent in three nasty moves.


------------------------------------
Hit 'em in the air
------------------------------------
Sometimes characters play a little hand-ball with their opponents by 
repeatedly punching, uppercutting and otherwise bouncing them along in the 
air.  Lau is the true master of this technique, able to bounce opponents up 
to eight times in a single combination of moves.  But everyone can do it to 
some degree.

If you manage to catch the opponent in the air, make them pay.  Experiment 
tacking on different moves after your favorite combos.  Knees are 
particularly good at knocking opponents skyward, and their exist many 
pseudo-combinations involving a knee attack (For+Kick) followed immediately 
by something else.  Jeffry's Knee&Dashing Uppercut combo is a perfect 
example. (For+Kick,For,For+Punch,Punch).


------------------------------------
Fake Out for a Boot to the Head
------------------------------------

One of the more artistic methods of beating computer opponents is to jump 
over the computer's head and do a heavy kick to the head.  There are two 
sure-fire methods of doing this attack versus any computer opponent.

The first is to jump over the opponent's head.  After you land, immediately 
jump backwards back over the opponent.  DO NOT TURN AROUND BEFORE JUMPING.  
You should be flying backwards through the air.  As you pass over the 
opponent, press For+Kick.  You will do a heavy kick into the back of the 
opponent's head.

A second more mystifying method starts by jumping over the opponent's head.  
After landing, press For and press and hold forward to begin running toward 
the edge, away from the opponent.  The computer will run after you.  Just as 
you are about to run off the edge, jump straight up into the air.  The 
computer will run underneath you, and skid to a halt on the edge.  It's 
momentum will take it underneath and in front of you.  Press For+Kick, and 
you will do a heavy kick to the head before the computer has a chance to 
recover, kicking it out of the ring!!  This will work on 
every opponent, including Dural.

CHARACTER PLAYING GUIDE
------------------------------------
Here is a general character playing guide which will help you with some 
strategies for specific players.  Each character's guide is divided into 3 
sections: Strengths, Weaknesses and Beating the Computer.

------------------------------------
Jacky -- "Ballet of the Fighter"
------------------------------------

Jacky's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Jacky is a favorite among advanced players because of his wide variety of 
attacks and combinations.  Jacky is perhaps the most flexible of the 
characters, able to easily attack standing opponents, crouching opponents, 
jumping opponents, opponents behind him and opponents who just knocked him 
down.  Many of his combinations attack both high AND low, such as his 
Punch&Foot sweep or his Double Punch, Elbow & Kick.  His Punt Kick is deadly 
versus crouching opponents, and opponents who are not cautious getting off 
the ground.  Finally, his pounce is quick and deadly.

Jacky's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
It's tough to find weaknesses in Jacky because of his flexible arsenal of 
moves.  But when compared to the other characters, his weakness is that he 
is not the "best" in any one thing.  He is good all around, but he does not 
have the best range, best speed, best power, best throws, or best combos.  
He is good all around, but if your playing style is geared to specializing 
in a particular type of attack, other characters would be better.  For 
instance, if you love making throws, Jeffry or Wolf are better.  If you are 
good with quick, light attacks, Lau or Pai or Sarah are better.  If you play 
a positional game of hitting and running, Kage is better.  Jacky is good at 
all these things, but he is not a specialist.

Beating the computer Jacky:
------------------------------------
It is extrememly difficult to lose to the computer Jacky.  In fact, it is SO 
hard to lose you may want to take the opportunity to practice some difficult 
throws or moves on him while you have the chance.  Show off for the crowd a 
little, they'll appreciate it.


------------------------------------
Jeffry -- "A Pillar of Strength"
------------------------------------

Jeffry's Stregnths:
------------------------------------
Power and throws are Jeffry's strengths.  He and Wolf do the most damage 
with basic punches and kick, and Jeffry has EIGHT (!!) throws to smash 
opponents flat on the mat.  If an opponent pauses or kicks over Jeffry's 
head, a good Jeffry player can do a throw & Body Splash pounce for an easy 
50% of their life bar.  Scariest of all is Jeffry's Toe Kick o' Doom combo, 
the most powerful combination in the game.  This toe kick followed by a LONG 
range Cruicifix Piledriver and a Butt Bomb will always, ALWAYS, KO the poor 
opponent in three devastating moves.  Jeffry's Backbreaker is also (not 
surprisingly) greatly feared as one of the most damaging single moves in the 
game.  Finally, Jeffry's Uppercuts and Rushing Uppercuts have deceptively 
long ranges and can hit crouching opponents or opponents knocked into the 
air by another attack.

Jeffry's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Jeffry is one of the slowest characters.  His recovery from missed attacks 
is relatively slow.  Butt Bombs usually miss, although the Body Splash has a 
good chance of hitting.  However, missing either leaves Jeffry prone and 
possibly vulnerable.  Likewise, missing a jumping double kick leaves Jeffry 
flat on his back.

Beating the Computer Jeffry:
------------------------------------
Block his punches, then retaliate with a punch/kick combo or other quick 
move. Punch & throw techniques work very well against Jeffry, since he is 
usually charging right into them.

</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
------------------------------------
Sarah -- "Femme Fatale"
------------------------------------

Sarah's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Sarah has the flexible arsenal of Jacky, but is faster and lighter than her 
brother.  Her Light Pounce (Tap Up+Punch) almost always hits if the opponent 
is knocked down, and her elbow and knee can keep crouching opponents honest.  
Her back kick and quick attacks keep most opponents on their toes.

Sarah's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Sarah's attacks are all somewhat weak, so she must connect more frequently 
than stronger characters to get the KO.  Also, the lack of a foot sweep 
makes standing opponents more difficult to handle.

Beating the computer Sarah:
------------------------------------
Play defensively.  Block her punches or knees, then do a quick attack.  
Punch & kick combos followed by pounces work particularly well.  Avoid 
crouching, since her elbow/kick combo and her rushing knee can hit you 
easily.


------------------------------------
Kage -- "Death from Above"
------------------------------------

Kage's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Kage has the greatest range and best movement of all the characters.  He can 
roll forward and backwards, doing a foot sweep with either.  He can flip 
backwards quite quickly, and can jump twice the height and distance of all 
the other characters.  His flying kick and Double Footed Sweep have 
extremely long ranges, and he can do a kickflip backwards or forwards as the 
situation warrants.  He can even pounce on a character from any distance in 
the ring, and his double-foot heavy jumping kicks roll out safely whether he 
kicks forward or backward.  If he misses a mid-range pounce, he lands on his 
feet and can immediately do a throw, kickflip or other attack if the 
opponent is nearby.  Given all this, Kageis the best positional character in 
the game, and is the best at jockying for better spots on the ring to both 
get Ring Outs and avoid them.

Kage's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Kage has trouble against crouching opponents.  In addition, his long  range 
attacks (including his pounces) are all slow, and take a long time to 
recover from if blocked.  His head dive is virtually worthless, except after 
the Ten Foot Toss, and missing a flying kick can put Kage in quite an 
awkward position.  When playing Kage it is crucial to not overly rely on his 
slower attacks, using his Punch/Kick and Heel Kick/Sweep combos to keep 
opponents off-balance for the occasional Flying Kick or jumping attack.  The 
element of surprise is essential with Kage.

Beating the computer Kage:
------------------------------------
The computer Kage is a sucker for ducking his first kick in a round, and 
getting thrown with Def+P (or B+P in Akira's case).  If you get knocked 
down, roll backwards.  If Kage dives at you (which he often does), do your 
most powerful single attack that hits CROUCHING opponents.  Wolf's 
Shoulder Ram, Akira's Body Check, Jeffry's Toe Kick/Punch Combo, Lau's Knife 
hand/Double Punch/Crescent Kick, Pai's Foot Sweep, Jacky's Punt Kick, 
Sarah's Elbow/Knee Combo, and Kage's Flying Kick are probably the best ways 
to hit Kage after he misses a head dive.  Be careful to block his heel 
kicks, and block low if he starts to roll or slide toward you.  If he misses 
a foot sweep or flying kick, don't hesitate to make him pay.


------------------------------------
Pai -- "Pulling the Strings"
------------------------------------

Pai's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Pai's greatest strength lies in her speed, and in one move: her Back+Punch 
throw.  This throw stops punching and kicking opponents dead in their 
tracks, and completely negates much of the value of some special attacks as 
well, such as Jeffry's Rushing Punches and Uppercuts, Akira's Rushing Palm 
and Lau's Knife Hand.  It can even grab Kage's Flying Kick, believe it or 
not.  This takes away a lot of options for opponents who fight Pai, and 
force them torely on either crouching attacks, or attacks which are often 
slower and harder to recover from.  Pai's speed allows her to then strike 
back, and her pounce is almost always a hit.  In addition, her foot 
sweep is useful if used judiciously, and her punch/kick combos are all 
reasonably powerful.

Pai's weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Pai has serious problems dealing with crouching opponents, since none of her 
"special" attacks hit crouching defenders.  Also, although she is fast, her 
attack power is weak, so she has to connect that much more often to get a 
KO.

Beating the computer Pai:
------------------------------------
Wait for her to come at you with an attack.  Block high.  If she punches 
you, duck after the last punch so that she will either kick over you or you 
will block her low kick.  If she does a low kick, just hit her.  If she 
kicks over your head, do a throw.  Likewise, if she misses a pounce 
be sure to throw her.


------------------------------------
Wolf -- "Rage in the Ring"
------------------------------------

Wolf's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Wolf is as powerful as Jeffry with his basic attacks.  Although Wolf does 
not have as many throws as Jeffry, the throws he has are more than adequate 
to do the job.  If used wisely when opponents are vulnerable, his shoulder 
ram & pounce is devastating.  Essentially, Wolf is a powerhouse who can grab 
or ram opponents for tremendous damage.

Wolf's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Wolf's biggest weakness is his speed.  His punches and uppercuts are 
extrememly slow, and his recovery from attacks is snail-paced.  His arsenal 
is not nearly as flexible as other characters, and blocked shoulder rams 
leave him wide open for retaliation.  Wolf is best played with an eye for 
intimidating opponents into making mistakes, leaving them open for a 
shoulder ram or throw.

Beating the computer Wolf:
------------------------------------
If Wolf starts punching, block it then punch back.  Three punches, followed 
by a crouching punch and low kick, work surprisingly often on him.  One 
tactic that almost always works for a quick hit is to start the round by 
jumping straight up in the air.  Wolf will usually do three punches 
underneath you while you are in the air.  As he does this, hold the joystick 
back and press kick.  You will do a backwards double footed kick into Wolf's 
spine.


-----------------------------------------
Lau -- "Furious Flurry of Fists and Feet"
-----------------------------------------

Lau's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Lau has the fastest punches and kicks in the game.  His punches and kicks 
are so fast, in fact, that if a kick knocks an opponent into the air, he can 
follow it up with two or three more attacks before the opponent lands.  This 
ability to play "handball" with his opponents produces many ring outs, and 
many KO's.  Lau has an eight hit combination, for instance, which does 
tremendous damage and pushes the opponent ridiculous distances across the 
ring.  His face slam does terrific damage, and his foot sweep and punch/heel 
kick combo are both difficult attacks to avoid.

Lau's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Although Lau can string together his punches and kicks quite quickly, he is 
slow to recover after any combo or "heavy" move.  Also, Lau has to be 
careful about not getting thrown by opponents who duck underneath his 
running punches.

Beating the computer Lau:
------------------------------------
Beat the computer Lau exactly as you did Pai.  Just be forewarned that Lau 
mixes up his attacks more than Pai, and has much better timing than Pai.  
Nonetheless, the same defensive strategy suggested for Pai works for Lau.


------------------------------------
Akira -- "Invincible Motions"
------------------------------------

Akira's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Akira has the fastest special attacks in the game.  His rushing palm, body 
check and rushing elbow are all so fast that they can all connect on an 
opponent who has missed anything other than a punch.  These attacks are not 
only lightning fast, but as powerful as dynamite.  The body check can do as 
much as 85% of the life bar on opponents who are close enough, and the 
rushing palm can do upwards of 65% of the life bar on occasion.  His rushing 
elbow can hit crouching opponents, as can his Double Kick and Elbow.  One VF 
player put it best when they said that while Jacky instills the fear of the 
unknown because of his wide variety of attacks, Akira instills the fear 
of the known, because his opponents know EXACTLY what Akira will do but are 
almost powerless to prevent it.

Akira's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Although Akira's attacks are powerful and blindingly fast, he takes longer 
to recover from these attacks than almost any other character recovering 
from a special attack in the game.  Any missed special attack leaves Akira 
wide open for a combo or even a throw on occasion.  And to compound this, 
NONE of his special attacks hit standing defenders.  This is a tremendous 
hinderance, since Akira must resort to low kicks and punches to hit standing 
opponents.
 
Beating the computer Akira:
------------------------------------
Keep in mind that Akira is vulnerable after any special attack.  Keep him at 
bay with single or double punches, and never crouch.  Stand and block all 
his attacks.  If you block an elbow, kick, body check or rushing palm, do 
your most powerful single move.  If Akira knocks you down, roll backwards.  
If he misses the pounce, quickly run forward (For,Hold For) and throw him.


------------------------------------
Dural -- "Superhuman Cybernetics"
------------------------------------

Dural's Strengths:
------------------------------------
Dural, the final Bonus stage character, has some of the best moves from each 
of the other eight characters.  She has some of Wolf and Jeffry's throws, 
Kage's flying Kick, Lau's punching ability, Wolf's Clothesline and Akira's 
Single Kick.  Dural is extremely quick, and difficult to 
throw, and it is almost impossible to pounce on Dural if you knock her down.  
Her attacks all do significant damage, and she throws opponents with eerie 
regularity.

Dural's Weaknesses:
------------------------------------
Dural is susceptible to Uppercuts, Jumping Punches and Crouching Punches.  
Her knee pounce (borrowed from Kage) is very slow, and it takes her a long 
time to stand back up from it.  If she tries it and misses, don't waste 
time; beat her into the ground with the best attack or combination you can 
master.


Beating Dural:
------------------------------------
Play off her weaknesses.  Don't try to throw her, and be prepared to miss if 
you pounce on her once you knock her down.  If necessary, you can beat her 
quite soundly by jumping straight in the air and doing a double-fisted punch 
(Hold Up,For+Punch).


------------------------------------
Sudden Death
------------------------------------

If the final deciding set is a draw, the next round will be a sudden death 
match on a ring about 1/16 the size of a normal ring.  The winner of that 
match wins by KO or knocking his opponent out of the tiny ring, and usually 
one person is knocked out after the first or second hit connects.

This was a very brilliant and innovative idea for the extra draw round.  It 
is appropriate that a such an originally styled fighting game like VF would 
had an equally original draw round.

If it is not the last set, a draw will award one win to both players.  If 
there is another draw in sudden death, the computer awards one of the two 
with a win and therefore the game.


------------------------------------
The Computer
------------------------------------

As you fight the computer you will advance up through the ranks in the
following order:

Jacky, Jeffry, Sarah, Kage, Pai, Wolf, Lau, Akira, Dural

Dural is the final opponent that you will fight, and it is a metallic 
looking female who has all the moves of every character.  You will get ONE 
chance to beat it, and the round will go to one more set than is normal.  So 
if your machine is set to 2 out of 3, you must defeat Dural 3 out of 4, and 
so on.  The tough part is that you will only get ONE chance to defeat Dural, 
and if you lose, then it's Game Over for you, buddy.  Have someone join in 
to save you if you're losing.  One nice touch is that after the game is over 
(if your last battle was with Dural), the credits run by and the instant 
replays of the final rounds that you played against all the computer 
opponents to get up to the end are replayed.  The last one is of Dural 
KO'ing you, unless you beat Dural :)

The one shortcoming is that there appear to be no story-telling endings.
After beating it numerous times (even without continuing) it does seem safe 
to say that Sega did not include a very important psychologically satisfying 
feature in this game.


------------------------------------
Game Adjustments
------------------------------------

As mentioned at the beginning of this FAQ, VF can be adjusted so that the 
player must win 2, 3, 4, or 5 sets to win a game.  This is done from the 
inside of the game through the test mode.  It can be set one way for player 
vs. player modes, or differently for player vs. computer.  the factory 
setting is two out of three for both the player vs. player and player vs. 
computer modes.  
difficulty can also be set.  The different levels effect ring size and the 
amount of health you start with.

Difficulty    Ring Width       Energy   (1P)   Time Bar Color
-------------------------------------------------------------
Easy          1500             198      158    Red
Normal        1400             180      144    Yellow
Hard          1300             162      129    Green
Hardest       1200             144      115    Blue

The Time Bar Color is the color of the thin line beneath your Time in the 
bottom right hand corner of the screen.  Note that the difficulty is self-
adjusting, becoming harder or easier as players win or lose.

Not too sure what the 1P is meant for, but I would guess that is has 
something to do with when one player is playing the computer.  Normal is the 
default factory setting.


------------------------------------
A word from our Sponsor
------------------------------------
here's the latest from Sega:

They're beginning to plan a large marketing push for VF.  This will include 
promos for tournaments and the like.  To do this, they'll be shipping VF T-
shirts, posters, banners, keychains, and even fortune cookies (with VF moves 
in them) to help promote the game.  Look for this stuff to start appearing 
soon.

Everything in the demo is possible (ie Sarah's crescent).  Every move that 
the computer does is also possible.

There are storylines for each of the characters.

How about VF2? "Definitely, but that's privileged information for the time 
being."  Additionally, a rumor surfaced recently about VF2 being field 
tested in Japan.  (Always take such rumors with a grain of salt, 
however....)


------------------------------------
The Rumor Mill
------------------------------------

This is the place where rumors are old rumors are dispelled and new ones
originate.  if I'm missing anything, and I'm sure I am (contrary to popular 
belief I am not perfect), feel free to e-mail me and let me know.

THROW REVERSALS-
------------------------------------
still only a rumor.  I've never seen these done, but I've heard a lot of
people claim to have seen Jacky and Wolf in particular do this.  supposedly 
the attacker begins a throw, but then the defender counters it and sends 
them on the floor.  sort of like Pai's defensive grab.  Some people have 
said they think it is with the kick button and then back or down.  Someone 
saw Wolf grab his opponents kick, and then punch them in the face while 
holding their leg.

Another person saw Pai begin a defensive throw on Jacky, but then Jacky
re-reversed it back on Pai.


JEFFRY'S LONG DISTANCE HURL
------------------------------------
It has been widely rumored that Jeffry can throw opponents half way across 
the ring after his Ultimate Press (B,B+P), instead of just dropping them on 
the ground at his feet.  I can verify that this is possible, since I did it 
myself at least once.  In fact, Jeffry threw the hapless Jacky so far away, 
that my followup pounce didn't reach him!!!  Unfortunately, how I did it or 
if it was a glitch of some sort remains a mystery....


MUTANT COLORS-
------------------------------------
Lately a lot of people have been discussing the suupposed glitch of when the 
plyer's colors and body parts (arms and legs) are all screwed up and out of 
order.  Game play is still normal.  Is there a pattern, or is it random?


SECOND COLORS-
------------------------------------
You get them when you play same character/same character matchups, but can 
you select them purposely?  some people have claimed to have gotten them, 
but no methods are yet confirmed.

Someone was playing Akira vs. Akira, and he was the second player.  He chose 
a gray Akira, somehow, and so he and his friend were playing an entire game 
with 2 gray Akiras...

Here's one way to get the second colors (Player 2 only).  When you start a 
new game, have player 1 move his cursor over a character.  Now have Player 2 
move his cursor over that same character.  Have player 2 choose that 
character.  Now the first player can choose whoever he wants, but the second 
player will have the secondary color.


TRICKS -
------------------------------------
You can get the credits of the programmers to come up on the screen by 
holding down a START button during the demo.  When it comes to the standard 
demo w/ Sarah kicking Kage, the credits will come up.  Keep holding the 
START button to keep the credits coming, or else they will freeze.

Also, you can get Kage to _roll_ while the demos are running.  Just spin the 
player one joystick, and he'll roll either backward or forward, it's up to 
you. On the beginning of the computer intro, you can get Kage to roll off 
the mat almost before Sarah even tries to kick him.  After you finish a game 
against the computer, thelast round which you lost will then be played 
during the intro.  If you got to Dural, the round where you beat Akira 
will be shown.  What a great way to rub in a loss, especially if the 
computer had a real good comeback on you :)


KAGE'S FACE MASK
------------------------------------
It seems that after about 3,000 plays, the mask on Kage falls off instead of 
just his headband.  You can see his teeth and a scar on his cheek.


USING DUPLICATE COLORS
------------------------------------
In order to play with both players having the same colors, have one player 
select a character.  The other player should now highlight, but not select, 
the character to the LEFT of that character. For example, if you both want 
to play Pai, then the second person should highlight Akira.  (If you both 
want to play Akira, highlight Jacky).  Now press Right+All three buttons 
simultaneously.  When play begins, you will both be using Player 1's colors 
(eg. both Pai's will have blue uniforms.)


PLAYING AS DURAL
------------------------------------
It is possible to play as Dural, although the timing to do so is a bit 
tricky.
 First, you must beat the computer Dural and have 2 games worth of credits 
in the machine ready to go.  After beating the game, have one player press 
start and pick a character.  As soon as that character finishes smiling, but 
before the game actually starts, player 2 should press start to interrupt 
the process.  If your timing is perfect, and the stars are perfectly 
aligned, and you've been a good boy or girl, player 2 may come in as Dural.

Should you be fortunate enough to get to play as Dural, here are Dural's 
(known) special moves: Wolf's Suplex (Def+Punch), Wolf's Clothesline 
(For,For+Punch), Jeffry's Body Press Throw (Back+Punch), Kage's Rolling Kick 
(For,For+All), Kage's Knee Pounce (Up+Punch), Akira's Kick (For,For+Kick), 
Pai's DDT (For, Down+Punch)

Good luck!

------------------------------------
PUBLIC OPINION
------------------------------------

Public opinion isn't always right, but it does help us to get a feel for 
what the average Joe is getting out of this game.  Surveys are helpful to 
new players and veteran fighters alike, for they help to open our eyes to 
the world around us.  In seeking to have more stuff in this guide that's not 
just general facts or my own opinion, this chapter has been included to let 
us all get an idea what the general Virtua Fighter's player is thinking.

This is open to any VF player who can get his/her response in to me (not 
just internet people :)   Please continue to respond, and Enjoy!
