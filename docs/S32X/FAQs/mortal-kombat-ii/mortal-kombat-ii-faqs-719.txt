Section 4: Movie Endings
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Mortal Kombat II:
-----------------

  Reptile has always loyally served as Shang Tsung's protector.  While 
maintaining a very low profile in the first tournament he discovered Tsung's 
plot to force the remaining members of his near extinct race into slavery 
under Shao Kahn's rule.  Reptile then devises a plan of his own. He enters 
the Outworld tournament, defeats Shao Kahn and turns 
against Shang Tsung, ending his master's scheme. Now his race can live on in 
their own peaceful existence.


Ultimate Mortal Kombat III:
---------------------------

  Reptile is ordered by Shao Kahn to find and kill Kitana. He is successful 
in completing his task but upon returning, finds himself shunned by the 
Emperor. Shao Kahn promised Reptile that if he was successful that he would 
resurrect Reptile's race. Shao Kahn never had any intentions of fulfilling 
his promise. Enraged, Reptile turns against his master and defeats him in 
battle. But by killing his master, Reptile destroys the one chance to ever 
know his true race.


Mortal Kombat IV:
-----------------

  For the first time, Mortal Kombat Endings have picked up sound and motion, 
unfortunately, they come in one of the last installments of the Mortal Kombat 
Anthology.

  Reptile and Quan Chi stand in the Snake Stage. Reptile bows to Quan Chi and 
gets down on one knee in servitude. As the conversation progresses the camera 
pans around the two in a circle.

<Reptile> Quan Chi, I have served our Lord Shinnok well in the destruction of 
Earth warriors.

<Quan Chi>  Yes, you are most proficient in all your efforts.

<Reptile> Now I wish to return in time to my home world before it was 
destroyed at the hands of Shao Kahn.  As the new ruler supreme of all 
reality. Shinnok alone has the power to grant my request.

<Quan Chi>  You dare make such a perpetuous request of your lord and master?

<Reptile>  Is it a simple request for one of such great power.

<Quan Chi>  It is also not worth his attention.

[Reptile stands up and yells at Quan Chi in defiance.]

<Reptile> I demand it! If it were not for warriors such as myself his attack 
against Raiden's forces would have failed!

<Quan Chi>  Perhaps you should convey your feelings to Shinnok yourself!

<Reptile>  What?

[Shinnok teleports in front of Reptile and grabs him by the throat,lifting 
him off the ground.]

<Shinnok> Infidel! You are in no position to demand anything!  I could kill 
you with a mere thought!

<Reptile>  [choking] But, we had a deal!

[The camera pans out and shows Shinnok choking Reptile.]

<Shinnok>  A deal? I am not a God of my word, Reptile! All deals are off!

[Shinnok releases a blast of energy. Reptile explodes into pieces.]
