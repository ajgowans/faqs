I. OVERALL AND CHARACTER PLOT
-----------------------------

     Five hundred years ago, Shang Tsung was banished to the Earth realm.
With the aid of Goro he was to unbalance the furies and doom the planet to
a chaotic existence.
     By seizing control of the Shaolin Tournament, he trued to tip the
scales of Order toward Chaos.  Only seven warriors survived the battles
and Shang Tsung's scheme would come to a violent end at the hands of Liu Kang.
     Facing execution for his failure and the apparent death of Goro,
Shang Tsung convinces Shao Kahn to grant him a second chance.
     Tsung's new plan is to lure his enemies to compete in the Outworld
where they will meet certain death by Shao Kahn himself.
     Now the Kombat continues...


Liu Kang
--------

     After winning the Shaolin tournament from Shang Tsung's clutches, Liu
Kang returns to his temples.  He finds his sacred home in ruins, his
Shaolin brothers killed in a vicious battle with a horde of Outworld
warriors.  Now he travels into the dark realm to seek revenge.


Kung Lao
--------

     A former Shaolin Monk and member of the White Lotus Society.  He is
the last descendent of the great Kung Lao, who was defeated by Goro five
hundred years ago.  Realizing the danger of the Outworld menace, he joins
Liu Kang in entering Shao Kahn's contest.


Johnny Cage
-----------

     After Shang Tsung's tournament, the martial arts superstar
disappears.  He follows Liu Kang into the Outworld.  There he will compete
in a twisted tournament which holds the balance of Earth's existence, as
well as a scrpit for another blockbuster movie.


Reptile
-------

     As Shang Tsung's personal protector, the elusive Reptile lurks in the
shadows, stopping all those who would do his master harm.  His human form
is beleived to disguise a horrid reptilian creature whose race was thought
extinct millions of years ago.


Sub-Zero
--------

     Thought to have been killed in the Shaolin tournament, Sub-Zero
mysteriously returns.  it is beleived he traveled into the Outwrold to
again attempt to assassinate Shang Tsung.  To do so, he must fight his way
through Shao Kahn's tournament.


Shang Tsung
-----------

     After losing control of the Shaolin tournament, Shang Tsung promises
his ruler Shao Kahn to shape events that will lure the Earth warriors to
compete in his own contest.  Conviced of this plan, Shao Kahn restores
Tsung's youth and allows him to live.


Kitana
------

     Her beauty hides her true role as personal assassin for shao Kahn.
Seen talking to an Earth realm warrior.  Her motives have come under
suspicion by her twin sister, Mileena.  But only Kitana knows her true
intentions.


Jax
---

     His real name is Major Jackson Briggs, leader of a top U.S. special
forces unit.  After receiving a distress signal from Lueutenant Sonya
Blade, Jax embarks on a rescue mission.  One that leads him into a ghastly
world where he believes that Sonya is still alive.

Mileena
-------

     Serving as an assassin along with her twin sister, Kitana, Mileena's
dazzling appearance conceals her hideous intentions.  At Shao Kahn's
request, she is asked to watch for her twin's suspection.  she must put a
stop to it at any cost.


Baraka
------

     He led the attack against Liu Kang's Shaolin Temple.  Baraka belongs
to a nomadic race of mutants living in the waste-lands of the Outworld.
His fighting skills gained the attention of Shao Kahn, who recruited him
into his army.


Scorpion
--------

     The Hell-spawned specter rises from the pit.  After learning of
Sub-Zero's return, he again stalks the ninja assassin, following him into
the dark realm of the Outworld where he continues his own unholy mission.


Raiden
------

     Watching events unfold from high above, the thunder god realizes the
girm intentions of Shao Kahn.  After warning the remaining members of the
Shaolin tournament, Raiden soon disappears.  He is believed to have
ventured into the Outworld alone.



II. BASIC MOVES
---------------


Face Punch  :  HIGH PUNCH
Body Punch  :  LOW PUNCH
Face Kick   :  HIGH KICK
Body Kick   :  LOW KICK
Block       :  BLOCK

Jump Kick   :  Up + HIGH or LOW KICK
Jump Punch  :  Up + HIGH or LOW PUNCH
Roundhouse  :  Back + HIGH PUNCH
Foot Sweep  :  Back + LOW PUNCH
Uppercut    :  Down + HIGH PUNCH
Crouch Punch:  Down + LOW PUNCH
Crouch Kick :  Down + LOW KICK
Turning Kick:  Jump over opponent.  When you pass the center of his body,
                press either KICK.  The character will turn and kick at the
                opponent.
Throw       :  Forward + LOW PUNCH(Close to opponent)
Avoid Throw :  Diagonally down away from opponent + BLOCK
Close Move  :  Any attack button(Close to opponent)

     Each character has their own Close Move.  For example, Using HIGH
PUNCH with Baraka will cause him to backhand his opponent, while Liu Kang
will do a double forearm.  Note that Jax has the only Close Move that will
stun the opponent, leaving them open for attack.



III. NOTE ON FINISHING MOVES
----------------------------


     As in Mortal Kombat I, each character has their own fatality, or
move that will kill the opponent, usually very violently.  In Mortal
Kombat II, each character has four other finishing moves:  Babality,
Friendship, Pit 2/Tomb, and Dead Pool.

Babality
--------
     When completed, the opponent will be changed into a baby.

Friendship
----------
     Instead of a violent death to the opponent, the chosen character will
do a cute(and sometimes humorous) special effect.

Pit 2/Tomb
----------
     As in Mortal Kombat I, the Pit has returned, where players can knock
their opponents onto the ground below.  Also in Mortal Kombat II, there is
a room known as the Kombat Tomb, where the ceiling is a bed of spikes and
the player can knock his opponent onto the ceiling.

The Dead Pool
-------------
     Another stage in Mortal Kombat II is the Dead Pool, where the
combatants fight on a small strip over a large acid pool.  After defeating
your opponent, you can knock them into the acid, which eats their body,
leaving a skeleton which floats by.


     Note that the Pit 2/Tomb move can only be done on either the Pit II
stage or the Kombat Tomb stage.  in order to perfom the Babality of
Friendship move, you must finish your second winning round WITHOUT using
either PUNCH button.
     To knock the opponent off into the Dead Pool, simply uppercut your
opponent while pressing down and holding LOW PUNCH and LOW KICK.
     (NOTE:  To make the opponent slide of the spikes on the ceiling in
the Kombat Tomb, push both joysticks down as soon as the crescendo(the
quick notes that inform you a fatality is about to happen) hits.  Continue
to hold the joysticks down until the opponent begins to slide.)
     (NOTE:  Johnny Cage's and Shang Tsung's Friendships were altered in
3.1 due to the fact that the conflicted with other moves.  In 2.1, Cages'
was : Down - down - down - HIGH KICK.  Shang Tsung's was: Hold BLOCK(back
- back - down - back - HIGH KICK).)




IV. HIDDEN CHARACTERS
---------------------

     Congratulations!  You have found the passage from the Outworld to the
Earth realm.  Now you must battle with an undiscovered warrior from Mortal
Kombat One.  Prepare yourself to return to Goro's Lair.


Jade
----

     In order to compete against Jade, the green female assassin, you must
see either her or the grey ninja Smoke in the Living Forest stage.  Then,
when fighting the last opponent before the mystery stage (the question
mark before Shang Tsung), you must defeat your opponent in one round
by using the LOW KICK button ONLY.


Smoke
-----

     To fight against Smoke, the grey ninja, you must see him or Jade in
the Living Forest.  Then, during the Portal stage (the room with the big
black swirl with the four sorcerers floating in the background), you must
make Dan Forden appear.  Dan Forden is the little figure that
occasionally appears on the bottom right hand corner on the screen and
says 'Toasty!' when you uppercut your opponent.  When he appears, push the
joystick down and press your START buton.


Noob Saibot
-----------

     To fight the black ninja, Noob Saibot, you must get fifty wins in a row.


Smoke and Jade clues
--------------------

     On 3.1 occaisonally before a match, Smoke or Jade will pop out for a
brief moment and give you a clue on how to fight them.

Smoke clues                            Jade clues
