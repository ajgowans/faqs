11. SUPER NINTENDO DOOM
=======================
o Episode 1, KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEAD:

  Once you beat the big badasses
  and cleaned out the moon base
  you're supposed to win, aren't
  you?  Aren't you?

  Where's your fat reward and
  ticket home?  What the hell
  is this?  It's not supposed
  to end this way!

  It stinks like rotten meat,
  but looks like the lost Deimos
  base.  Looks like you're stuck
  on The Shores of Hell.  The
  only way out is through.

  Continue the DOOM experience
  and play The Shores of Hell
  and its sequel, Inferno!

o Episode 2, THE SHORES OF HELL:

  You've done it!  The hideous
  cyberdemon lord that ruled
  the lost Deimos moon base has
  been slain and now you are
  triumphant!  But...where are
  you?  You clamber to the edge
  of the moon and look down to
  see the awful truth.

  Deimos floats above Hell
  itself!  You've never heard
  of anyone escaping from Hell,
  but you'll make them sorry
  they ever heard of you!
  Quickly, you rappel down to
  the surface of Hell.

  Now, it's on to the final
  chapter of DOOM! -- Inferno.

o Episode 3, INFERNO:

  The loathsome spiderdemon that
  masterminded the invasion of
  the moon bases and caused so
  much death has been beaten for
  all time.

  A hidden doorway opens and you
  enter.  You've proven far too
  tough for Hell to contain, and
  now Hell at last plays fair --
  for you emerge from the door
  to see the green fields of
  Earth!  Home at last.

  I wonder what's been happening
  on Earth while you battled the
  evil unleashed.  It's a good
  thing that no Hell-spawn could
  have come through that door
  with you ...

12. SEGA GENESIS 32X DOOM
=========================
o Sega 32X Doom:

    traps were no match
    for you.  You have
    proven yourself the
    best of all!
