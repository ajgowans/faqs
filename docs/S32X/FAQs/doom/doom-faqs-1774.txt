0. INTRODUCTION
===============
o This document provides information on various Classic Doom, Ultimate Doom and
  Doom II games, and compares the game-console and handheld versions to the
  original PC editions, and to each other.

o Unless otherwise noted, all Doom (Doom 1) and Doom II games covered in this
  document are "Classic" Doom games, running (or simulating to some degree) a
  version of the "id Tech 1" game engine.  This was the engine used in the
  first PC Doom game, and various subsequent Doom/Doom II titles and products
  prior to the release of Doom 3 in 2004.

o In this document, for purposes of comparison, Doom 64 (for Nintendo 64) is
  considered a Classic Doom game.  While the map levels, graphics, audio, and
  some aspects of gameplay are very different from the equivalent things in the
  original PC games, Doom 64 does use a modified id Tech 1 engine, and shares
  many similarities with the PC Classic Doom games.

o Apple Macintosh ("Mac") and other computer-based editions of the PC Doom
  games exist, however they are identical in most aspects to the PC games and
  so are generally not addressed in this document.  Other editions of Classic
  Doom/Doom II games not addressed here may be included in future updates.

o This document does not cover the "Final Doom" or "Master Levels" games/
  mapsets for PC and various consoles.  A similar document comparing these
  games can be accessed at: http://classicdoom.com/fdoomcmp.htm

o In the game descriptions included in this document, "Pros" are notable
  features of the indicated game version, some of which may set it above other
  versions covered here; "Cons" are generally features that existed in the
  original PC game(s) but are missing from the indicated version, or may
  otherwise cause a version to be rated below other versions covered here;
  "Miscellaneous" notes cover those features which do not necessarily fall
  under the other categories.

o This document is 79 characters wide, and is best viewed in a monospaced font.

1. CLASSIC DOOM GAMES: GENERAL
==============================

  elements:

  Monsters     |Weapons        |Ammo                  |Items and Artifacts
  -------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------

               |               |                      |Stimpack
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: These elements exist in all Doom games including Nintendo 64 Doom 64
  (which, unlike other console versions, is not a copy of an original PC game).
  "Monsters" include enemy types found in all Doom, Ultimate Doom, and Doom II
  games.  Doom 64, and every Doom II game (or Episode) will also include these
  monster/enemy types: Arachnotron, Hell Knight, Mancubus, and Pain Elemental.
  In Doom 64, the pink "Demon" monster is referred to as a "Bull Demon".
  Note that not all monsters, items, etc. appear in all games at all difficulty
  levels.  Also, some elements found on a given map during a single-player game
  may be absent from the same map during a multiplayer game, and vice versa.
  In Sega 32X Doom, a BFG 9000 weapon is only available when using cheat codes.
  For more about Doom cheat codes, access: http://classicdoom.com/doomcode.htm

o In all Doom/Doom II games, a player character may walk, turn, run, "jump"
  (run across small gaps), and side-step/strafe.  In almost all Doom games,
  these maneuvers can be done both in first-person mode, and while the Automap
  screen is displayed.

o All Doom/Doom II games can experience speed fluctuations during gameplay.
  (This is most noticeable with early game-console ports.)  In general, overall
  game speed will drop/rise with an increase/decrease in sprites and textures
  displayed on the screen.

o The following are limitations in all console and handheld Doom/Doom II games:
  Deathmatch games cannot include monsters; No in-game ability to import
  external map levels, customized graphics or sound effects; No way to adjust
  graphics resolution for a given screen size; Cannot place numerical markings
  on the Automap.

o Many non-computer Doom/Doom II games exclude some of the maps that exist in
  the original PC games, and/or include maps not found in the PC games.  (Some
  game-console versions also have new hidden exits added to some map levels.)
  Because of this, the exact playing order of map levels may differ from that
  of the comparable PC game.

o In all Doom games, monsters can turn and/or move in any one of at least 8
  lateral directions.  In the Super Nintendo and Sega 32X games, monsters
  often appear to be walking backwards, or "crab-walking" sideways, because
  artwork is supplied only for their forward-facing surfaces.  (No sprites are
  included to give the appearance of turning or facing away from the player.)

o Many console Doom games allow cheats to be invoked with an ordinary gamepad/
  controller.  Various cheats may also be loaded into many console/handheld
  Doom games with separately sold devices (such as a Game Genie or Game Shark)
  that plug into the game system.

2. COMPUTER-BASED DOOM/DOOM II GAMES
====================================
o Various IBM-PC 486 computers, and PC-compatible 486 and Pentium computers,
  were used as the test systems for the PC games described in this document
  (version 1.9 of PC Ultimate Doom and version 1.9 of PC Doom II: Hell on Earth
  were tested, as well as various earlier versions of all PC Doom and Doom II
  games).  For testing multiplayer games, these computers were connected to
  similar systems via various network and/or modem connections.

o Pros: In general, more features and options, and greater versatility than all
  game-console or handheld versions of Doom or Doom II.  2 players may play
  simultaneously via modem connection; Up to 4 may play via network connection.
  On a modern PC, gameplay is somewhat faster/smoother than in most console/
  handheld versions.  Ability to use and configure a variety of input devices
  (keyboard, mouse, joystick, gamepad, etc.) for game play.  Doom II-based PC
  games include more monster types than are available in many console/handheld
  Doom or Doom II games.  A game in progress may be saved at any point (to any
  of several save-game slots) and restored later to the same point.  Saved
  games retain copious information (player location, health, weapon, ammo and
  armor status, live/dead status of all monsters on the map level, etc.).
  Supports 9 screen sizes, which also allows the first-person view to be
  expanded to fill the entire screen.  Deathmatch games may include monsters.
  PC Doom 1's entire first Episode is still available as shareware.  Thousands
  of external map levels are available for use with these games.  Built-in
  ability to record or watch single-player or multiplayer gameplay sessions.
  Later PC Doom/Doom II game releases include extensive documentation and
  reference material with the software.  Separate utilities exist which allow
  players to create or edit new map levels, new artwork and/or new sounds for
  existing Doom/Doom II games.  A variety of free third-party Doom engines have
  been released, which add improved graphics, better multiplayer support and
  other features to the retail PC games.  Wide variety of built-in cheat codes.

o Cons: Some infrequently-encountered flaws exist in the original commercial PC
  Doom/Doom II games, including areas on some levels where players may become
  inadvertently trapped, a program bug that creates nearly-intangible monsters,
  a bug that can allow a player character to become stuck partially inside
  solid objects when reloading saved games, and a bug in Doom II where the game
  can crash if a map-30 save-game file is reloaded.

o Miscellaneous: Games by id Software.  Disk or CD format; Also available via
  direct download through some retail sites.  Decent graphics resolution and
  quality; Very good in some hardware/software configurations.  The commercial
  edition of Doom ("Doom 1") for the PC includes 27 map levels, divided into
  three 9-map Episodes.  A later reissue of the game, titled "The Ultimate
  Doom: Thy Flesh Consumed", includes the original three Episodes and a newer
  fourth Episode which includes 9 more map levels.  Doom II ("Doom 2: Hell on
  Earth") for the PC has 32 map levels built in, and adds new monsters and a
  double-barrelled shotgun not found in Doom 1 or Ultimate Doom.  Occasionally
  when a Pain Elemental monster (in Doom II) dies, the Lost Souls generated by
  its explosion may be flung through nearby walls, where they may become
  trapped (this has little effect on the game, since Lost Souls do not count
  towards a Kills score).  Unlike some console/handheld versions, a player can
  only cycle between fist and chain saw while a Berserk power-up is in effect.

3. SONY PLAYSTATION (PS1) DOOM
==============================
o A Sony PlayStation, model SCPH-1001, equipped with one standard PlayStation
  controller (model SCPH-1080), was used as the test system for the Custom
  PlayStation Edition of Doom described in this document.  For testing
  multiplayer games, the system was connected to an identical system via the
  PlayStation Link cable (model SCPH-1040).

o Pros: Features most of the map levels (or equivalents) from the PC games "The
  Ultimate Doom" and "Doom II" (Doom 2: Hell on Earth).  Large variety of
  monster types (17) compared to many other game-console and handheld versions.
  Link ability (for compatible systems) allows 2-player Deathmatch and Co-Op
  games.  The first-person view and status bar combination fills the entire
  display space on the screen (some other console versions of the same era do
  not support this).  Map level, skill level, health, armor, weapon and ammo
  information is translated to a password code which is given after successful
  completion of each map level (some other console Doom games cannot save such
  information externally).  The last password entered or generated on the
  password screen may be re-entered with a single button press (useful when,
  for example, a player is killed and wishes to restart on the same map with a
  non-default status).  Extensive controller customizing is allowed (the Fire
  button can swap functions with Speed button or Activate button, etc.).  PS1
  Doom games can also be played (single-player, only) on PS2 and PS3 consoles
  via backward compatibility.

o Cons: The 24 maps from Jaguar Doom are incorporated (with minor edits) into
  the 33-map "Ultimate Doom" Episode (most of the maps in Atari Jaguar Doom are
  edited/simplified versions of the original PC Doom maps).  Minor errors exist
  in a few map levels (secret room impossible to access, difficulty in picking
  up an item, etc.).  From powering up the PlayStation, there is a relatively
  long wait (over a minute) before the player can actually start playing.  Game
  cannot make use of a memory card (sold separately).  Game does not save
  controller or sound configuration settings.  Some monster/enemy types from PC
  Doom II are missing from this version, including the Arch-Vile, "SS Officer",
  and the "Baphomet"/Boss entity.  No crushing ceilings in the "Ultimate Doom"
  maps.  Occasionally, objects in the foreground are partially overlaid by
  background wall or floor textures.  Weapons are cyclic-access only (although
  weapon choices may be cycled while the game is paused).  The status bar can
  only display the ammo level of the currently selected weapon (in PC and some
  other games, all ammo levels for all weapons can be displayed at all times).
  All of the built-in cheat codes are rather long and complex (for example, an
  invincibility cheat code is 3 button-presses on the Jaguar, 5 on the PC, 10
  on the PlayStation).  No "Gamma Correction" feature or equivalent.

o Miscellaneous: Port by id Software and Williams Entertainment, Inc.  CD
  format.  59 map levels, 8 of which are not found in PC Doom/Doom II games.
  Good graphics resolution and quality.  Gameplay speed is adequate, but is
  somewhat slower than a PC Doom/Doom II game played on a modern computer.
  Game information stored in a password code may be inaccurate (health, armor
  and ammo level numbers tend to be rounded).  Features music tracks (and other
  background audio effects) not found in PC Doom games.  Features new colored
  lighting effects.  Health potions and Spiritual Armor bonuses add 2% to a
  player's health or armor (versus 1% in the PC games).  In PC Doom II, the two
  shotgun types are both represented as weapon 3 in the status bar; In PS1
  Doom, the shotgun types are separated into weapons 3 and 4.  No "Nightmare"
  skill level.  Some Doom II monsters (Heavy Weapon Dude, Revenant, etc.)
  appear in the "Ultimate Doom" maps when playing at the highest skill level
  ("Ultra Violence").  Monster and weapon sounds tend to differ from the sounds
  used in the PC games.  In this game, "blurred" objects are translucent and
  faded, but otherwise maintain their normal colors and surface features (in
  the PC games, "blurred" objects, when visible, are a translucent gray, with a
  flat, flowing/scrambled surface).  Another version of the Spectre appears in
  this game: the "Nightmare Spectre", which appears visibly darker, and is
  harder to kill than the normal Spectre.  The Nightmare Spectre is a not a
  1-to-1 replacement for the missing Arch-Vile monster.  Very tall rooms/areas
  from equivalent maps in the PC game(s) are lower in this version.  An "X-ray
  vision" cheat code not found in the PC games is included.  An animated "wall
  of fire" exterior background is used in some map levels.  Some monsters and
  monster projectiles tend to move slower than their PC-game counterparts.
  Graphics "noise" may sometimes be seen along the top or bottom edges of
  walls.  On occasion, the "marine face" in the status bar explodes when the
  player character dies.  On occasion, when a Pain Elemental monster dies, the
  Lost Souls generated by its explosion may be flung through nearby walls,
  where they may become trapped.  Lost Souls that are trapped behind walls may
  still be visible, but may be impossible to kill (this normally has no effect
  on the game, since Lost Souls do not count towards a Kills score).  The voice
  effect that accompanies "victory text" is not heard if Music Volume is turned
  down.  Some monsters on the original PC maps are replaced with different
  monsters on the equivalent maps in this version.  In 2-player games, both
  player characters wear a green uniform.  In Cooperative games, Frags are not
  indicated in the tally screens.  The "WOLFENSTEIN" and "GROSSE" secret map
  levels from PC Doom II do not appear in this game.  The "Commander Keen"
  character from PC Doom II is not included.  The "Lots of Goodies" cheat code
  will not add keys if they are not necessary.

  Notes: Map equivalency is based on general map layouts, not map names.
  The PC Doom/PC Ultimate Doom map in Episode 3 Mission 7 is referred to as
  "GATE TO LIMBO" in the tally screens, and "LIMBO" in the Automap.
  The PS1 "HELL KEEP" map does not match the PC "HELL KEEP" map.  (It does,
  however, match an equivalent map in the Saturn, Jaguar, 3DO and GBA Doom 1
  games.)

4. SEGA SATURN DOOM
===================
o A Sega Saturn unit, model MK-80000A, equipped with one standard Sega Saturn
  Control Pad (model MK-80116), was used as the test system for the NTSC Sega
  Saturn Doom game described in this document.

o Pros: Features most of the map levels (or equivalents) from the PC games "The
  Ultimate Doom" and "Doom II" (Doom 2: Hell on Earth).  Large variety of
  monster types (17) compared to many other game-console and handheld versions.
  The first-person view and status bar combination fills the entire display
  space on the screen (some other console versions of the same era do not
  support this).  Map level, skill level, health, armor, weapon and ammo
  information is translated to a password code which is given after successful
  completion of each map level (some other console Doom games cannot save such
  information externally).  The last password entered or generated on the
  password screen may be re-entered with a single button press (useful when,
  for example, a player is killed and wishes to restart on the same map with a
  non-default status).  Extensive controller customizing is allowed (the Fire
  button can swap functions with Speed button or Activate button, etc.).

o Cons: No multiplayer ability (NTSC edition).  Overall game speed is slower/
  choppier in than in the PC games and some other game-console versions.  The
  24 maps from Jaguar Doom are incorporated (with minor edits) into the 33-map
  "Ultimate Doom" Episode (most of the maps in Atari Jaguar Doom are edited/
  simplified versions of the original PC Doom maps).  Minor errors exist in a
  few map levels (secret room impossible to access, difficulty in picking up an
  item, etc.).  Game cannot make use of a memory cartridge (sold separately).
  This game does not save controller or sound/music configuration settings.
  "Strafing"/side-stepping tends to be somewhat slower here than in many other
  versions.  Weapons are cyclic-access only, and can only be cycled in one
  direction.  Some monster/enemy types from PC Doom II are missing from this
  version, including the Arch-Vile, "SS Officer", and the "Baphomet"/Boss
  entity.  No crushing ceilings in the "Ultimate Doom" maps.  The status bar
  can only display the ammo level of the currently selected weapon (in PC and
  some other game versions, all ammo levels for all weapons can be displayed at
  all times).  Background objects or surfaces may sometimes overlap foreground
  objects/surfaces.  No "Gamma Correction" feature or equivalent.

o Miscellaneous: Port by Rage Software (NTSC edition).  CD format.  59 map
  levels, 8 of which are not found in PC Doom/Doom II games.  Decent graphics
  resolution and quality.  Sega Saturn Doom is very similar to the earlier
  PlayStation (PS1) Doom game (map levels, monsters, sound effects, music, and
  passwords used are all virtually identical).  Saturn Doom graphics are
  similar to the PS1 Doom graphics, but lack some of the enhanced lighting and
  color effects used in PS1 Doom.  Game information stored in a password code
  may be inaccurate (health, armor and ammo level numbers tend to be rounded).
  Health potions and Spiritual Armor bonuses add 2% to a player's health or
  armor (versus 1% in the PC games).  In PC Doom II, the two shotgun types are
  both represented as weapon 3 in the status bar; In Saturn Doom, the shotgun
  types are separated into weapons 3 and 4.  No "Nightmare" skill level.  Some
  Doom II monsters (Heavy Weapon Dude, Revenant, etc.) appear in the "Ultimate
  Doom" maps when playing at the highest skill level ("Ultra Violence").
  Monster and weapon sounds tend to differ from the sounds used in equivalent
  PC games.  In this game, "blurred" objects are translucent and faded, but
  otherwise maintain their normal colors and surface features (in the PC games,
  "blurred" objects, when visible, are a translucent gray, with a flat,
  flowing/scrambled surface).  A second version of the Spectre appears in this
  game: the "Nightmare Spectre", which looks like the normal Spectre, but is
  harder to kill.  The Nightmare Spectre is a not a 1-to-1 replacement for the
  missing Arch-Vile monster.  Very tall rooms/areas from equivalent maps in the
  PC game(s) are lower in this version.  Some monsters and monster projectiles
  tend to move slower than their PC-game counterparts.  The player character's
  basic running speed (compared to other moving objects in the environment) is
  somewhat faster here than in other versions.  In general, each weapon's
  "rapid-fire" rate is higher here than in other Doom games.  Graphics "noise"
  may sometimes be seen along the top or bottom edges of walls.  On occasion,
  when a Pain Elemental monster dies, the Lost Souls generated by its explosion
  may be flung through nearby walls, where they may become trapped.  Lost Souls
  trapped behind walls may still be visible, but may be impossible to kill
  (this has little effect on the game, since Lost Souls do not count towards a
  Kills score).  The voice effect that accompanies "victory text" is not heard
  if Music Volume is turned down.  Some monsters on the original PC maps are
  replaced with different monsters on the equivalent maps in this version.
  Player may select stereo (default) or monophonic audio.  Stereo sounds may
  occasionally phase-shift, giving false impressions of sound sources (for
  example, during continuous firing of the player's chaingun, some of the
  reports may seem to originate from a point to the player's left or right).
  Pausing the game does not interrupt music.  "DEMO" will flash on the screen
  while demo games are shown.  3 demo games are shown during Attract mode
  (including demos from 2 "secret" map levels), then the third demo is repeated
  once before cycling back to the first.  In most Doom/Doom II games that end
  victoriously with a "parade" (or "Cast of Characters"), the parade repeats
  until the player resets or restarts the game; In Saturn Doom, the parade runs
  through one time, and then the game returns to the Main Menu screen.  The
  "WOLFENSTEIN" and "GROSSE" secret map levels from PC Doom II do not appear in
  this game.  The "Commander Keen" character from PC Doom II is not included.
  The "Lots of Goodies" cheat code will not add keys if they are not necessary.

5. NINTENDO 64 DOOM 64
======================
o Note that Doom 64, unlike other console/handheld Doom games, was not a direct
  port or conversion of an existing PC Doom game.  It does, however, share many
  of the same features found in all other Classic Doom/Doom II games.

o A Nintendo 64 Control Deck, model NUS-001, equipped with one standard
  Nintendo 64 Controller (model NUS-005), was used as the test system for the
  Doom 64 game described in this document.

o Pros: Comparatively smooth, high-resolution graphics produced through dynamic
  antialiasing.  The "pixelation" effect (a drop in graphics resolution seen in
  other Doom games as the player character approaches a surface or object) is
  notably reduced here.  Features some new graphical effects (fog/mist, fading
  objects, animated skies, etc.).  First-person view fills the entire space on
  the screen (with or without the "status bar" displayed).  The "bar" of the
  "status bar" is invisible: only the numerals used for health, ammo and armor,
  and icons used for keys, will actually obstruct any part of the first-person
  view.  The status bar may be switched off, allowing only the first-person
  view to fill the screen.  Map level, skill level, health, armor, weapon and
  ammo information is translated to a password code which is given after
  successful completion of each map level (some other console Doom games cannot
  save such information externally).  On the password screen, the last password
  entered or generated may be re-entered with a single button press (useful
  when, for example, a player is killed and wishes to restart on the same map
  with a non-default status).  Doom 64 can make use of a "Controller Pak" (a
  separately-sold memory cartridge), allowing the storage and retrieval of up
  to 16 game passwords.  Built-in screen brightness adjustment option, somewhat
  similar to the "Gamma Correction" feature in PC Doom games.  The Automap is
  dual-mode, allowing the player to view the map with a detailed textured floor
  (using an Area's actual floor textures), or view the map as a plain (PC-Doom
  style) untextured Automap.  Extensive controller customizing is allowed (the
  Fire button can swap functions with Speed button or Activate button, etc.),
  including the ability to choose and/or modify any of 5 preset configurations.
  The player can move within the game using the controller's directional-pad
  buttons, and/or the controller's built-in joystick.  The player character can
  rotate at varying speeds: turning slowly using controller buttons, marginally
  faster using the joystick, or very fast with the joystick if the "Controller
  Stick Sensitivity" is increased through a setting under the game's Options
  Menu.  The game provides a feature for "centering" the position of the game
  screen on the display device, allowing horizontal and vertical adjustments.
  Game messages (such as "PICKED UP A BOX OF SHELLS") may be toggled on or off,
  as can be done in the PC Doom games.

o Cons: No multiplayer ability.  On some display devices the first-person view
  may seem too dark, and/or the status bar data may be difficult to read, even
  when the game's brightness level is set to maximum.  Occasionally objects in
  the foreground are partially overlaid by background wall or floor textures.
  Weapons are cyclic-access only (but may be cycled in both directions).  Game
  does not save controller, display, or sound configuration settings.  Although
  joystick-based turning speed can be greatly increased through a setting under
  the game's Options Menu, D-pad (or button-based) turning speed cannot.  The
  status bar can only display the ammo level of the currently selected weapon
  (in PC and some other game versions, all ammo levels for all weapons can be
  displayed at all times).  Once in Automap mode, a player must cycle through
  both Automap styles to return to the first-person view (this can be done
  almost instantaneously if desired, but must be done every time the Automap is
  accessed).  At 16 characters long, the passwords are somewhat cumbersome to
  enter, unless they are stored in a separately-sold Controller Pak memory
  cartridge.  The Zombieman and Shotgun Guy enemy types are very similar in
  appearance, and may be indistinguishable during combat.  The delay between a
  player character's death and subsequent resurrection is longer here than in
  other Doom games.

o Miscellaneous: Game by Midway Home Entertainment, Inc. and id Software.
  Cartridge format.  32 map levels, none of which are found in PC Doom/Doom II
  games.  Gameplay speed is adequate, but some aspects of a player character's
  motion (such as running speed) may be marginally slower here than in a PC
  Doom/Doom II game played on a modern computer.  More monster/enemy variety in
  this game than in most Doom 1-based games (several of the Doom 64 monster
  types are based on PC Doom II types).  With some new features and completely
  re-worked graphics, the "look and feel" of this game bears only a distant
  resemblance to all other Doom games.  All enemies have a modified appearance,
  and in some cases are only vaguely similar to their counterparts in other
  Doom or Doom II games.  Virtually all objects and surface textures have been
  changed from their original designs, including weapons, power-ups, walls,
  floors, ceilings, switches and teleporters.  Map levels may have structures
  that simulate crossing paths at different heights (such as a solid "bridge"
  that a player can walk over or under), and similar map features which are not
  found in other Doom games.  Graphics, overall, tend to be darker here than in
  most other versions.  Features new music tracks (and other background audio
  effects) not found in the PC games.  Some features appear in this game that
  appear in no other Doom or Doom II game, including flat horizontally-sliding
  surfaces, wall-mounted monitors that can be used to view distant parts of the
  map, automated traps that launch projectiles, etc.  Doom 64 features a new
  "Boss" monster (referred to in the game as the "Mother of all Demons") which
  is not found in any other Doom game.  The Spider Mastermind monster found in
  most other Doom games is not included.  Another version of the Imp appears in
  this game: the "Nightmare Imp", which is semi-translucent, darker, and faster
  than the normal Imp, and launches high-velocity fireballs.  Arachnotrons fire
  twin, side-by-side plasma bursts (versus single-stream bursts in all other
  games).  Pain Elemental monsters can release 2 Lost Souls at a time (versus a
  maximum of 1 at a time in all other games).  Lost Souls are semi-translucent
  in this game, and tend to attack more quickly than their counterparts in
  other games.  In Doom 64, Baron-Of-Hell projectiles can injure Hell Knights,
  and vice-versa (in other Doom/Doom II games, both projectiles are harmless to
  both monsters).  The "Demon" monster (a pink, muscular, hunched-over, biting
  monster), is referred to as a "Bull Demon" in the game's printed manual.  In
  this game a Spectre Demon will be opaque until it detects a player character,
  whereupon it becomes translucent.  If a translucent Spectre Demon is killed,
  its body becomes opaque.  A new laser-type weapon appears in this game, and
  uses the same "cell" ammunition as a plasma rifle or BFG 9000.  Doom 64
  includes a unique type of power-up (referred to in this document as a "Demon
  Artifact") which acts both as an enhancement for the new laser weapon, and as
  a special key/activator for use within the game's final map level.  Demon
  Artifacts have an appearance somewhat similar to the demon/pentagram graphic
  that is used both in the game's tally screens and on the cover of the game's
  manual.  When any Demon Artifact is picked up, an icon representing that
  particular Artifact appears at the lower-right corner of the Automap screen.
  A double-barrelled "Super Shotgun" (similar to the weapon found in Doom II
  games) appears in this game.  The double-barrelled shotgun and the rocket
  launcher both have a "kick" when firing, giving a slight backwards push
  against the player character.  In this game, the plasma rifle tends to make a
  continuous buzzing noise whenever it is selected as the current weapon.  In
  this game, the chain saw has a pair of blades, side by side (versus a single
  blade in all other Doom games).  In all other Doom games, only players and
  monsters may be teleported from place to place; In Doom 64, other objects
  (power-ups, weapons, and structures) may also be moved from place to place,
  or fade in and out of existence.  Occasionally monsters will spontaneously
  "fade in" to a location on the current map (an effect which is similar to
  teleportation).  Game information stored in a password code may be inaccurate
  (health, armor and ammo level numbers tend to be rounded).  Monster and
  weapon sounds tend to differ from the sounds used in the PC games (in fact
  most sound effects are identical to those used in the PlayStation/PS1 Doom
  games, released prior to Doom 64).  The sound effect used in PS1 Doom for an
  item re-spawning during a Deathmatch game is used in this game to indicate
  that a monster or item/object is "fading into" (or "spawning into") a nearby
  location.  In this game, "blurred" objects are translucent and faded, but
  otherwise maintain their normal colors and surface features (in the PC games,
  "blurred" objects, when visible, are a translucent gray, with a flat,
  flowing/scrambled surface).  Explosive barrels are not mentioned in the game
  manual, but do appear in this game, as they do in all other Doom games.  The
  "marine face", seen in the status bar of all other Doom/Doom II games, is not
  in the status bar in this game.  "Secret areas" are usually announced (via
  on-screen messages) as a player character enters them.  While walking/running
  in Automap mode, the player icon does not turn to change direction; instead,
  the Automap rotates around the icon, which is always facing north.  In this
  game, the "radiation shield" power-up appears as a green "biohazard" symbol,
  instead of as the white, full-body "radiation suit" seen in all other Doom
  games.  The physical location of an item on a given map can vary with the
  skill level that the map is played on (for example, the blue keycard in the
  STAGING AREA map is in an open area when the game is played on skill 1, but
  is located in a small, closed room on skill 4).  Doom 64 uses skill level
  names unique among console Doom games: "BE GENTLE!", "BRING IT ON!", "I OWN
  DOOM!", and "WATCH ME DIE!".  Some surfaces with 1-way transparency are used
  in this game (a feature missing from most other non-computer versions).  In
  Doom 64, entering a valid map 1 password, or using a special locked exit on
  map 32, will reveal a hidden "Features Menu", which allows access to various
  cheat functions.  On occasion, the first-person display will shake as an
  indication of a major change in the current map level (changes in the map's
  topography, structures, etc.).  When firing a weapon, the first-person view
  can jump or vibrate with the weapon's recoil.  Every 30 seconds of idle time
  after a player character dies, the game will display one of 12 "taunts" (such
  as "HAHAHAHA!" or "HAVE YOU HAD ENOUGH?").  Both shotgun types are reloaded
  without the relatively elaborate reloading animation seen in all other Doom/
  Doom II games (however the weapon reloading times remain comparable to those
  of the other games).  In most Doom and Doom II games the plasma rifle is
  swung up and to the side for a moment at the end of a firing sequence; in
  this game the weapon always faces forward.

  or Doom II game.

6. ATARI JAGUAR DOOM
====================
o An Atari Jaguar 64-Bit Interactive Multimedia System, equipped with one
  standard Jaguar controller, was used as the test system for the Atari Jaguar
  Doom game described in this document.  For testing multiplayer games, the
  system was hooked to an identical system via the Jaglink Interface cable.
  Multiplayer games were then tested with identical systems hooked together
  via Catbox interface devices (sold separately by ICD, Inc.).

o Pros: 2-player ability (although multiplayer function may be unstable).  The
  first-person view and status bar combination fills the entire display space
  on the screen (some other console versions of the same era do not support
  this).  Some controller customizing is allowed (the Fire button can swap
  functions with Speed button or Activate button, etc.).  Memory built into the
  game cartridge will automatically store controller configuration settings,
  the sound volume setting, the current skill level setting, and also stores
  the map level numbers of all Areas that were successfully conquered (except
  Area 24).  When first starting up the game, a player may choose to start play
  on any of 23 map levels previously conquered (this is a quick process, as
  there are no passwords to keep or re-enter), and may choose a different skill
  level to play it at.  During a game in progress, weapons are direct-access.
  The built-in cheat codes may be entered quickly and easily (for example, an
  invincibility cheat code is 3 button-presses on the Jaguar, 5 on the PC, 10
  on the PlayStation).  The Jaguar Doom game comes with a plastic overlay which
  fits into the top of the game controller, providing labels and weapon icons
  for the buttons on the controller's keypad.

o Cons: Most of the maps in this game are edited/simplified versions of the
  equivalent PC Doom 1 maps.  Games in progress cannot be saved (but a player
  may start a new game on any of 23 map levels previously conquered).  As
  stated in the printed manual, occasional "Network Errors" can occur during
  Deathmatch and Cooperative games, causing the game in progress to suddenly
  start over again on the current map.  Only 7 monster types in the game (tying
  with the Sega 32X and GBA Doom 1 games for least variety).  No Spectre Demon.
  No Cyberdemon or Spider Mastermind monsters.  No Blur Artifacts.  No
  light-amplification visors.  No crushing ceilings.  No music during gameplay.
  Somewhat lower graphics resolution or quality than some other large-screen
  console Doom versions.  The status bar can only display the ammo level of the
  currently selected weapon (in PC and other game versions, all ammo levels for
  all weapons can be displayed at all times).

o Miscellaneous: Port by id Software.  Cartridge format.  24 map levels, 2 of
  which are not found in PC Doom games.  Adequate graphics resolution and
  quality.  Gameplay speed is adequate, but can be somewhat slower than a PC
  Doom game played on a modern computer.  This game's mapset, in whole or in
  part, also appears in the PlayStation, Saturn, 3DO, Sega 32X and GBA Doom 1
  games or Episodes.  Rocket and barrel explosions can penetrate relatively far
  through solid walls and doors (allowing a player to kill some enemies without
  ever directly encountering them).  Health potions and Spiritual Armor bonuses
  add 2% to a player's health or armor (versus 1% in the PC games).  Picking up
  an Invulnerability Artifact tints the screen bluish-pink, as opposed to the
  white-out effect seen in many other versions.  In 2-player games, both player
  characters wear a green uniform.  In Deathmatch games, the Frag counts for
  both players are displayed in each player's status bar.  Corrosive floors
  (slime, etc.) will decrease a player's health quickly (faster in this version
  of Doom than in most other versions running at a comparable skill level).
  When the "Happy Ammo" cheat code is used, the player attains an ammo level of
  500 rounds for every weapon (versus a specific individual ammo level for each
  weapon in the PC games).  Game manual is written in English, French, German.
  Game manual states that cartridge memory will not accept more than 100,000
  changes to stored information (however this would still allow, for example,
  50 changes a day for more than 5 years).

  Jaguar equivalent exists for the PC "DIS" map.

  (It does, however, match the "TOWER OF BABEL" map in the 3DO and GBA Doom 1
  games, and the "HELL GATE" map in the PS1 and Saturn games.)

  however, match an equivalent map in the PS1, Saturn, 3DO and GBA Doom 1

7. 3DO (PANASONIC AND OTHERS) DOOM
==================================
o A Panasonic REAL 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, model FZ-1, equipped with one
  standard Panasonic 3DO controller (model FZ-JP1X), was used as the test
  system for the 3DO Doom game described in this document.

o Pros: Some controller customizing allowed (the Fire button can swap functions
  with Speed button or Activate button, etc.).  Ability to choose between 4
  window sizes (or 6, when using a cheat code) for the first-person view.  3DO
  system memory automatically stores controller configuration settings, the
  sound volume setting, the current skill level setting, the selected window
  size for the first-person view, and also stores the map level numbers of all
  Areas that were successfully conquered (except Area 24).  When first starting
  up the game, a player may choose to start play on any of 23 map levels
  previously conquered (this is a quick process, as there are no passwords to
  keep or re-enter), and may choose a different skill level to play it at.

o Cons: Games in progress cannot be saved (but a player may start a new game on
  any of 23 map levels previously conquered).  No multiplayer ability.  Overall
  game speed can be very choppy, and animation noticeably slows down and speeds
  up with variances in the number of on-screen textures and sprites.  This game
  uses the Jaguar Doom mapset (most of the maps in Jaguar Doom are edited/
  simplified versions of the original PC Doom maps), and includes no other
  maps.  No Cyberdemon or Spider Mastermind monsters.  No light-amplification
  visors.  No crushing ceilings.  Weapons are cyclic-access only.  First-person
  view does not fill the entire space above the status bar.  Game does not
  utilize all available display space on the screen.  The status bar can only
  display the ammo level of the currently selected weapon (in PC and some other
  versions, all ammo levels for all weapons can be displayed at all times).

o Miscellaneous: Port by Logicware and Art Data Interactive, Inc.  CD format.
  24 map levels, 2 of which are not found in PC Doom games.  Adequate graphics
  resolution and quality.  Gameplay speed, overall, is below the average speed
  of most other Doom games.  Features many of the music tracks from PC Doom,
  re-mastered with new and more distinctive instrumentation.  A built-in cheat
  code allows the first-person view window to be expanded two more times beyond
  the default maximum size (however, larger windows further slow down the
  game).  The game box for 3DO Doom advertises "full screen display", and the
  first-person view is indeed maximized within a window; but the window itself
  (when expanded to any size) is always bordered by static artwork.  Rocket and
  barrel explosions can penetrate relatively far through solid walls and doors
  (allowing a player to kill some monsters without ever directly encountering
  them).  Health potions and Spiritual Armor bonuses add 2% to a player's
  health or armor (versus 1% in the PC games).  In this game, "blurred" objects
  are a translucent gray with a plain, flat surface (in the PC games, "blurred"
  objects, when visible, are a translucent gray, with a flat, flowing/scrambled
  surface).  If the "Map All Things" cheat code is used, monster orientations
  are not indicated as they are in all other game versions that support this
  cheat code; all object indicators point in the same direction.  The "marine
  face" in the status bar always explodes whenever the player character dies.
  Music from the first map level accompanies the tally screens.  No "Attract
  mode"; no demo games.  When the "Happy Ammo" cheat code is used, the player
  attains an ammo level of 500 rounds for every weapon (versus a specific ammo
  level for each weapon in the PC games).

  Notes: Map equivalency is based on general map layouts, not map names.
  The PC Doom/PC Ultimate Doom map in Episode 3 Mission 7 is referred to as
  "GATE TO LIMBO" in the tally screens, and "LIMBO" in the Automap.
  The 3DO "DIS" map is equivalent to the PC "FORTRESS OF MYSTERY" map; No 3DO
  equivalent exists for the PC "DIS" map.
  The 3DO "TOWER OF BABEL" map does not match the PC "TOWER OF BABEL" map.  (It
  does, however, match the "TOWER OF BABEL" map in the Jaguar and GBA Doom 1
  games, and the "HELL GATE" map in the PS1 and Saturn games.)
  The 3DO "HELL KEEP" map does not match the PC "HELL KEEP" map.  (It does,
  however, match an equivalent map in the PS1, Saturn, Jaguar and GBA Doom 1
  games.)

8. SUPER NINTENDO DOOM
======================
o A Super NES ("SNES") Control Deck, model SNS-001, equipped with one standard
  Super NES controller (model SNS-005), was used as the test system for the
  SNES Doom game described in this document.  For testing multiplayer games,
  the system was connected to various similar systems via the X Band network,
  using a Catapult X Band modem device (model 00100).

o Pros: The basic map layouts tend to match the equivalent PC-Doom 1 maps with
  above-average accuracy (higher accuracy, overall, than is found in most other
  early console versions).  Simplified 2-player online Deathmatch ability via
  an X Band Network connection.  SNES Doom includes both the Spider Mastermind
  and Cyberdemon monsters from the original PC games (one or both of these are
  missing from GBA Doom 1 and some large-format console versions).  The Automap
  is actively updated at all times, whether displayed or not (in most other
  Doom/Doom II games, the Automap will not update while displayed).  A player
  character with 200% health will not automatically pick up a Soul Sphere on
  contact (in most other Doom/Doom II games, a Soul Sphere is always picked up
  on contact).  Weapon choices can be cycled while the game is paused.

o Cons: Games in progress cannot be saved.  Comparatively low-resolution
  graphics (most noticeable with distant objects); lowest overall resolution of
  all large-screen Doom games.  Some control "lag" (a delay between controller
  input and a reaction in-game).  Cannot play Episodes 2 or 3 using low skill
  levels.  For multiplayer games, a separately-sold "X Band" modem device, and
  a subscription to the X Band Network, is/was required for each player's game
  system.  Cooperative games are not supported.  Deathmatch games are scaled
  down in this version (no sound effects, items do not re-spawn, an enemy
  player character simply disappears from the Area when killed, exiting a map
  level displays the main menu, where both players must select which map to
  restart the game on, and weapons, ammo, etc., cannot be carried between map
  levels).  Most vertical surfaces tend to be somewhat "sticky", occasionally
  slowing or halting the player character on contact.  A player's shotgun in
  SNES Doom can only affect a single target when fired (in other Doom games,
  multiple targets in close proximity can be affected).  Shotguns or ammo clips
  dropped by killed enemies do not appear on the floor/ground.  A player may
  still pick up weapons after ammo levels are at maximum (for example, a player
  may pick up multiple shotguns, even after reaching the maximum carry limit of
  100 shells).  Newly acquired weapons or ammo items contain a standard amount
  of ammunition at all skill levels (in the PC games, the standard amount of
  ammo for each item is doubled when playing at the lowest or highest skill
  levels).  No controller customizing allowed.  Weapons are cyclic-access only
  (although weapons may be cycled while the game is paused), and weapon choices
  can only cycle in one direction.  No real textures for ceilings or floors
  (including corrosives and teleporters).  Monsters can only display a front
  side (and are essentially always facing towards the player).  No Spectre
  Demon.  Cannot save game configuration settings.  Game does not utilize all
  available display space on the screen.  Sounds from events at medium or long
  ranges may be truncated, or may not be played.  Although monsters can hurt
  each other, they cannot deliberately fight with each other.  No screen-flash
  warning as an Invulnerability Artifact or radiation suit begins to wear out.
  When the player character is attacked, the "marine face" in the status bar
  does not indicate direction of attack (as it does in other Doom games).
  Unlike other Doom versions, pivoting and strafing functions in this game are
  mutually exclusive.  The status bar can only display the ammo level of the
  currently-selected weapon (in PC and some other versions, all ammo levels for
  all weapons can be displayed at all times).  End-of-Episode story text is not
  always shown when finishing Episodes at low skill levels.

o Miscellaneous: Port by Sculptured Software, Inc.  Cartridge format.  22 map
  levels, all of which are found in PC Doom 1.  Gameplay speed is adequate, but
  will be slower than a PC Doom game played on a modern computer.  No "Attract
  mode"; no demo games.  A bug in the game can allow the player to instantly
  acquire additional weapons once a chain saw has been picked up.  In most Doom
  versions, a killed player restarts a map level with 100% health, 0% armor, a
  pistol and 50 bullets; but in SNES Doom, a killed player restarts with 100%
  health, and whatever armor, weapons and ammo that the player originally
  brought into the level.  While walking/running in Automap mode, the player
  icon does not turn to change direction; instead, the Automap rotates around
  the icon, which is always facing north (this is also how Automap "scrolling"
  is handled).  Some monsters are easier to kill than their counterparts in
  other versions of the game.  When cycling through weapons, the chain saw
  weapon slot is located between the shotgun and chaingun (in PC Doom the fist
  and chain saw share slot 1).  Unlike other Doom games, Blur Artifacts in SNES
  Doom can render the player undetectable to "waiting" monsters at medium or
  long range; A monster that detects a player at short range can even return to
  "wait" mode if the player moves away.  In this game, "blurred" objects are
  translucent and faded, but otherwise maintain their normal colors and surface
  features (in the PC games, "blurred" objects, when visible, are a translucent
  gray, with a flat, flowing/scrambled surface).  Hitting the Activate/Use
  button can still trigger the "grunt" sound effect, even when the player
  character is nowhere near a wall, switch, or door.  Compared to other Doom
  games, many sound effects in SNES Doom are mismatched with their events, or
  are used for multiple events (for example, a monster's "alert sound" can also
  be used for it's "growl" sound while patrolling).  Some action sequences
  (such as monster deaths, explosions, etc.) use fewer frames of animation than
  the equivalent sequences in other Doom games.  No exploding-monster effect
  (usually seen in PC Doom games when, for example, an Imp or Former Human is
  hit by a rocket).  Teleportation is instantaneous, without the motion-damping
  effect seen in other versions.  No "green spark" effect when a player or
  monster goes through a teleporter.  Impacts of bullets or shotgun pellets on
  walls are not visible.  No panels or switches are activated by projectile
  impacts, as they are in other versions.  An Artifact or power-up can be
  picked up when the player walks over it, but can also be picked up if the
  player is jumping (running) through the airspace above it.  A weapon icon
  appears in the player's status bar to show which weapon is currently held.
  Monster projectiles may affect monsters in ways contrary to what is seen in
  other Doom or Doom II games (a Cacodemon's projectiles can injure other
  Cacodemons, a Cyberdemon can be damaged by its own rockets, etc.).  Unlike
  other Doom games, a Cyberdemon in SNES Doom can use a melee/scratch attack at
  close range (although the normal rocket-firing animation is displayed).  The
  Cyberdemon tends to fire 2 rockets in a row, versus 3 in a row in all other
  versions.  Cyberdemon rockets appear to fly backwards.  A player's chaingun
  fires fewer bullets than what is indicated by the firing sound.  In SNES Doom
  a minimal burst of chaingun fire is typically 1 bullet (with 2 reports),
  versus 2 bullets in most other Doom games.  The plasma rifle fires its
  projectiles at a lower rate than in most other Doom games.  A BFG 9000 will
  use up to 40 energy cells per shot, but can be fired when less than 40 cells
  remain (most Doom/Doom II games always require a minimum of 40 cells).  Some
  projectiles move at faster speeds than in other Doom games.  In most other
  Doom games an elevator/lift will automatically reverse if a player/monster
  prevents it from rising to its highest position; In the SNES game, a blocked
  elevator will simply halt in place, and only move again when the obstacle is
  removed.  Crushing ceilings may not cycle upwards while a player/monster is
  being crushed (unlike certain crushing ceiling types in PC Doom/Doom II).
  Some secret doors/panels are better camouflaged in this game than in PC Doom.
  Players and monsters do not move laterally as a result of impacts or nearby
  explosions, as they do in other Doom games.  Phobos/Deimos/Hell landscapes
  are used as the background for the tally screens between map levels, showing
  the player's progress through the various stages of each Episode (this art is
  omitted from some other non-computer Doom versions).  After a player finishes
  Episode 2, an Episode-3 game begins automatically.  Maps in Episode 3 use the
  same sky/background used in Episode 2 (PC Doom uses a "Hell" sky/background
  for Episode-3 maps).  No scrolling/sliding textures, as are found in other
  Doom games.  No built-in volume controls (but music and sound effects can be
  switched on/off separately).  Most of the original PC Doom story text appears
  in this game.  Both armor-vest types are referred to as "MEGAARMOR" (in other
  games this term is used only for the blue 200%-armor vest).  No built-in
  cheat codes.

  Notes: The PC Doom/PC Ultimate Doom map in Episode 3 Mission 7 is referred to
  as "GATE TO LIMBO" in the tally screens, and "LIMBO" in the Automap.
  The "E#M#" designators used here for SNES Doom maps are for reference only,
  and are not displayed in the actual game.

9. SEGA GENESIS 32X DOOM
========================
o A Sega Genesis System Console, model 1601, equipped with one standard Sega
  Genesis "6-button" controller (model MK-1653), and one Sega Genesis 32X
  module (model MK-84000A), was used as the test system for the Sega 32X Doom
  game described in this document.

o Pros: Player can always start a game on any of 15 map levels.  The Automap is
  actively updated at all times, whether displayed or not (in most other Doom/
  Doom II games, the Automap will not update while displayed).  Some controller
  customizing allowed (the Fire button can swap functions with Speed button or
  Activate button, etc.).  With a "6-button" controller attached, weapons can
  be accessed directly, or weapon choices can be cycled in both directions.

o Cons: Requires both a Sega Genesis system and the "32X" expansion module.
  This version has the least map levels of all Doom games, and most of the maps
  are edited/simplified versions of the original PC Doom 1 maps.  Games in
  progress cannot be saved (but a player may always start a new game on any of
  15 maps).  No multiplayer ability.  No BFG 9000 weapon available without
  using a cheat code.  Monsters can only display a front side (despite the fact
  that screen shots on the game box and the 32X module box show side views of
  monsters).  Only 7 monster types in the game (tying with the Jaguar and GBA
  Doom 1 games for least variety).  No Spectre Demon.  No Cyberdemon or Spider
  Mastermind monsters.  No Blur Artifacts.  No light-amplification visors.  No
  crushing ceilings.  With a standard Sega "3-button" controller, weapons are
  cyclic-access only, and weapon choices can be cycled in only one direction.
  Cannot save game configuration settings.  First-person view does not fill the
  entire space above the status bar, and game does not utilize all available
  display space on the screen.  Although monsters can hurt each other, they
  cannot deliberately fight with each other.  Some rooms on some maps are
  inaccessible.  The few built-in cheat codes can be difficult to implement
  (the code button combinations may have to be pressed several times before a
  code will take effect).  The use of cheat codes can prevent access to some
  maps, and also prevents the game's full ending sequence from being shown.
  The status bar can only display the ammo level of the currently selected
  weapon (in PC and some other game versions, all ammo levels for all weapons
  can be displayed at all times).  Infrequent, brief flashes of graphics
  "noise" may sometimes appear across the first-person view or Automap screen.

o Miscellaneous: Port by id Software.  Cartridge format.  17 map levels, all of
  which are found in PC Doom games.  Decent graphics resolution and quality.
  Gameplay speed is adequate, but can be somewhat slower than a PC Doom game
  played on a modern computer.  Maps 16 and 17 can only be accessed if the game
  was started on map 1, and if cheat codes were not used during the game.  In
  order to see the game's entire ending sequence, a player must start on map
  level 1 and play the game all the way through without using cheat codes (a
  game won any other way will result in the credits being shown, and then the
  game simply halts with a plain textured screen and a "DOS prompt").  Contrary
  to what is stated in the game manual, a player cannot enter map 1 from map
  15; map-level sequence does not "wrap around".  Rocket and barrel explosions
  can penetrate relatively far through solid walls and doors (allowing a player
  to kill some monsters without ever directly encountering them).  Health
  potions and Spiritual Armor bonuses add 2% to a player's health or armor
  (versus 1% in the PC games).  Picking up an Invulnerability Artifact causes a
  drop in graphics chroma, as opposed to the white-out effect seen in many
  other versions.  Picking up a Berserk Pack will cause a relatively bright,
  sustained flash of red, which may be mistaken for the effect seen when the
  player character takes sudden, heavy damage.  The shotgun-loading sound is
  played (sometimes at very low volume) for a teleportation event, instead of
  the teleport sound heard in most other versions.  Map level names are not
  used, only map numbers.  Map numbers are only indicated in the tally screens,
  not while playing a map level.  In the Automap, the player icon (an arrow)
  looks like the one used in the PC games, as opposed to the green triangle
  used in most other versions.  There is an option in Automap mode to turn on a
  grid which overlays the map, and can be used as a reference for scale (a
  feature otherwise found only in the PC games).  Rockets fired by the player
  appear to fly backwards (the nose of the rocket faces the player as the
  rocket moves away).  All monsters, items and Artifacts located in very dark
  areas remain well lit at all times.  Not all teleporters function (but all
  important ones do).  Because graphics are only provided to show the front
  side of objects, some monsters in "wait" mode may seem blind when a player
  approaches them from behind (a monster will always appear to look at a player
  even when it is not actually facing toward the player).  When the "Happy
  Ammo" cheat code is used, the player attains an ammo level of 500 rounds for
  every weapon (versus a specific ammo level for each weapon in the PC games).

  Notes: The PC Doom/PC Ultimate Doom map in Episode 3 Mission 7 is referred to
  as "GATE TO LIMBO" in the tally screens, and "LIMBO" in the Automap.
  Map level names are not used in Sega 32X Doom.

10. NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE DOOM
==================================
o A Nintendo Game Boy Advance, model AGB-001, and a Nintendo Game Boy Advance
  SP, model AGS-001, were used as test systems for the GBA Doom game described
  in this document.  For testing multiplayer games, these system were connected
  to identical systems via one or more Nintendo Game Boy Advance Game Link
  cables (model AGB-005).

o Pros: Multiplayer link ability, allowing 2 players in Cooperative games, and
  2 to 4 players in Deathmatch games.  Includes 8 Deathmatch-only bonus maps
  not found in other commercial Doom games.  Some flaws have been corrected in
  some maps which were copied from earlier console Doom games.  A game in
  progress may be saved to any of 4 save-game slots in the Doom Game Pak, and
  save-game data includes controller, lighting and audio settings.  Supports 2
  lighting-style choices, "Dynamic" (normal), and "Static" (low light levels
  are increased, and lights that normally flash are always on).  Has 6-level
  "Brightness" adjustment option (somewhat similar to the "Gamma Correction"
  feature in the PC Doom games), which controls the maximum brightness of both
  Dynamic and Static lighting modes.  Includes an "Autorun" option (player
  always runs).  In the status bar, current ammo levels and limits are always
  displayed for all weapons (in some other/earlier console Doom games, only the
  currently-selected weapon can have an ammo level displayed).  Some controller
  customizing allowed (any of 6 preset button configurations may be selected).

o Cons: The original Game Boy Advance does not have built-in lighting, making
  games hard to view without constant external light hitting the screen at the
  correct angle (later GBA models, like the GBA SP, do have built-in lighting).
  Saved games may occasionally become corrupted, and fail to reload correctly.
  Cooperative games have a 2-player limit, even when 3 or more GBAs are linked.
  This game uses a slightly modified version of the Jaguar Doom mapset (most of
  the maps in Atari Jaguar Doom are edited/simplified versions of the original
  PC Doom maps), and has no other single-player maps.  The player character can
  potentially become trapped behind a wall or barrier on certain maps.  Only 7
  monster types in the game (tying with the Jaguar and Sega 32X games for least
  variety).  No Spectre Demon.  No Cyberdemon or Spider Mastermind monsters.
  No Blur Artifacts.  No light-amplification visors.  No crushing ceilings.
  Weapons are cyclic-access only.  In some of the preset button configurations
  weapon-swapping can be awkward, and weapon changes can occur unintentionally
  while performing certain maneuvers.  Some rooms in some map levels are
  inaccessible.  The sound effect used to indicate a player taking damage is
  also mistakenly used whenever a player lands unhurt after falling a short
  distance.  Frag counts in Deathmatch games are only displayed in the Automap
  view.  No tally screen is displayed, and no opportunity to save the game is
  given, when a player accesses the exit to the "MILITARY BASE" map level.

o Miscellaneous: Port by David A. Palmer Productions.  Cartridge format.  32
  map levels, 10 of which are not found in PC Doom games.  Decent graphics
  resolution and quality for the GBA screen.  Gameplay speed is adequate, but
  will be somewhat slower than a PC Doom game played on a modern computer.  The
  game's overall speed can be affected by the built-in lighting options, where
  Dynamic Lighting may lower the frame-rate, and Static Lighting may raise it.
  No "Attract mode"; no demo games.  No "Ultra-Violence" skill setting; the
  highest skill is "Nightmare".  Player can select the fist weapon at any time,
  whether or not a chain saw or Berserk Pack has been acquired.  When monsters
  or players are killed, their corpses disappear after a brief delay.  Monster
  and player blood is green instead of red.  All monsters, items and Artifacts
  located in very dark areas remain well lit at all times.  Sounds produced by
  distant events may be played at an undiminished volume, and/or may penetrate
  walls or areas that are "soundproof" in other Doom games.  When a pink Demon
  is killed, it makes the same sound as a dying Imp (in most other Doom games,
  Imps and Demons will make separate sounds).  No exploding-monster effect
  (usually seen in PC Doom games when, for example, an Imp or Former Human is
  hit by a rocket).  Rocket and barrel explosions can penetrate relatively far
  through solid walls and doors (allowing a player to kill some enemies without
  ever directly encountering them).  Teleportation is almost instantaneous,
  without the motion-damping effect seen in most other versions.  In a reversal
  of the Automap coloring used in most other Doom games, GBA Doom's Automap
  displays "viewed" surfaces as gray lines, and "unseen" surfaces (often added
  to the Automap when a Computer Area Map item is acquired) are displayed in
  red.  The Automap screen allows 5 preset zoom levels.  Health potions and
  Spiritual Armor bonuses add 2% to a player's health or armor (versus 1% in
  the PC games).  Picking up an Invulnerability Artifact tints the screen blue,
  as opposed to the white-out effect seen in many other Doom versions.  In this
  game, muzzle flashes from player weapons do not brighten nearby surfaces, as
  they do in other Doom games.  Unlike most other Doom games, Lost Souls are
  calculated in the Kills score displayed in the tally screens.  The tally
  screen shows both the time spent on the map, and the map's Par Time.  Phobos/
  Deimos/Hell landscapes are used as the background for the tally screens
  between map levels, showing the player's progress through the various stages
  of each Episode (this art is omitted from some other non-computer Doom
  versions).  The "YOU ARE HERE" indicators in the tally/landscape screens do
  not always point to the correct locations.  When the "Happy Ammo" cheat code
  is used, the player attains an ammo level of 500 rounds for every weapon
  (versus a specific individual ammo level for each weapon in the PC games).
  In this game the player's fist makes an impact noise when striking a wall or
  other inanimate object (in most other versions, fist impacts on inanimate
  objects are silent).

  Notes: Map equivalency is based on general map layouts, not map names.
  The PC Doom/PC Ultimate Doom map in Episode 3 Mission 7 is referred to as
  "GATE TO LIMBO" in the tally screens, and "LIMBO" in the Automap.
  The GBA "DIS" map is equivalent to the PC "FORTRESS OF MYSTERY" map; No GBA
  equivalent exists for the PC "DIS" map.
  The GBA "TOWER OF BABEL" map does not match the PC "TOWER OF BABEL" map.  (It
  does, however, match the "TOWER OF BABEL" map in the Jaguar and 3DO games,
  and the "HELL GATE" map in the PS1 and Saturn games.)
  The GBA "HELL'S KEEP" map does not match the PC "HELL KEEP" map.  (It does,
  however, match an equivalent map in the PS1, Saturn, Jaguar and 3DO games.)
  GBA Doom maps 25 through 32 are only accessible in Deathmatch games.

11. NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE DOOM II
=====================================
o A Nintendo Game Boy Advance, model AGB-001, and a Nintendo Game Boy Advance
  SP, model AGS-001, were used as the test systems for the GBA Doom II game
  described in this document.  For testing multiplayer games, these system were
  connected to identical systems via one or more Nintendo Game Boy Advance Game
  Link cables (model AGB-005).

o Pros: This game has more maps and monster types than the "DOOM II" Episodes
  of PlayStation Doom or Saturn Doom.  Multiplayer link ability, allowing 2
  players in Cooperative games, and 2 to 4 players in Deathmatch games.  Games
  in progress may be saved to any of 4 save-game slots in the Doom II Game Pak,
  and game data includes controller, lighting and audio settings.  Includes a
  6-level "Gamma" adjustment option to control the overall brightness of the
  game screen.  Controller customizing includes 4 preset button configurations,
  a 5-level "Sensitivity" adjustment option to control the player character's
  pivoting speed, and an "Always Run" option (player always runs).  In the
  status bar, current ammo levels and ammo limits are always displayed for all
  weapons (in many console Doom games, only the currently selected weapon can
  have an ammo level displayed).  The "Happy Ammo" cheat code will provide a
  backpack (in most other Doom games, a backpack is not provided, or a player's
  existing backpack is removed).

o Cons: The original Game Boy Advance does not have built-in lighting, making
  games hard to view without constant external light hitting the screen at the
  correct angle (later GBA models, like the GBA SP, do have built-in lighting).
  On rare occasions the game may freeze, requiring that the GBA be powered down
  and restarted.  Occasionally when a player weapon is fired at a close target,
  it auto-aims toward the ceiling/sky or floor/ground.  In some of the preset
  button configurations, weapon-swapping can be awkward, and weapon changes may
  occur unintentionally while performing certain maneuvers.  Weapons are
  cyclic-access only.  The auto-aim ability of monsters can remain unaffected
  when the player picks up a Blur Artifact.  Damage to a player's armor may not
  always be accurately represented in the status bar.  The scoring system for
  "Kills" is inaccurate under certain conditions (for example, unlike the PC
  games, GBA Doom II will count Lost Souls as score-affecting enemies, yet does
  not actually give credit to the player for killing them).  When the player
  character is attacked, the "marine face" in the status bar does not indicate
  direction of attack (as it does in other Doom games).  The Frag counts in
  Deathmatch games are only displayed in Automap view.  Cooperative games have
  a 2-player limit, even when 3 or more GBAs are linked.  Unlike the PC Doom
  games, a player's reverse-running speed is slower than forward-running speed.

o Miscellaneous: Port by Torus Games.  Cartridge format.  34 map levels, all of
  which (in whole or in part) are found in PC Doom II: Hell on Earth.  Decent
  graphics resolution and quality for the GBA screen.  Overall gameplay speed
  is adequate, but is somewhat slower than a PC Doom II game played on a modern
  computer.  No "Attract mode"; no demo games.  No "Ultra-Violence" skill
  setting; the highest skill is "Nightmare!".  Some GBA Doom II maps reflect
  certain features found in maps from older versions of PC Doom II.  In this
  game some maps have minor alterations, such as elevators replacing stairs,
  and strategically placed walls/barriers, or deleted windows, in order to
  reduce the maximum number of objects that need to be drawn at any given time.
  Some maps in this game have major alterations, such as deleted buildings; but
  in general there are fewer large omissions here than in some other console/
  handheld Doom II games.  The PC Doom II maps INDUSTRIAL ZONE and THE CHASM
  are each split into 2 "half" maps in this game.  When computing collision
  detection in this game, most non-structural objects have a comparatively
  narrow diameter, and this can allow some objects (such as players and/or
  monsters) to move very close together, or to push past one another, where
  they could not in PC Doom II.  Unlike most other Doom games, the monsters in
  this game cannot open doors.  Monsters and players may occasionally cross
  above/below one another (a player can even stand on top of a monster, which
  is something that does not occur in other commercial Doom games).  Some
  monsters on some map levels are "blind" or "deaf" where equivalent monsters
  in the PC maps are not.  A monster's "sensory range" is foreshortened in this
  game (monsters cannot see or hear as far as they can in PC Doom II or most
  other Doom games).  An active monster may halt in place if enough distance
  accrues between the player and monster.  Monsters can remain inactive even
  while being attacked by a player at long range.  When a monster is killed,
  its corpse will flicker and disappear after a brief delay.  Arch-Viles may
  resurrect killed monsters even after the monster corpses have disappeared.
  Mancubus monsters are not able to aim vertically, and will always launch
  their fireballs in a wide, predetermined pattern.  Revenants will only fire
  homing missiles, which are smokeless (in PC Doom II, Revenants can fire 2
  missile types: a smoking homing missile, and a smokeless non-homing missile).</pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
  Unlike most other Doom games, monsters such as Imps or Demons cannot scratch
  or bite a player from very high/low adjacent areas.  Floating/flying monsters
  may not always change altitude to attack a target, or may fail to rise again
  after dropping in pursuit of a target.  Monsters may continue to try to
  attack killed players.  Some monster sound effects are missing, including the
  walking sounds for Arachnotrons and Cyberdemons.  Common bullet-firing sounds
  are used when the Chaingunner enemy fires (in PC Doom II, a shotgun sound is
  used).  The sounds used during an Arch-Vile attack are reversed from sounds
  heard in PC Doom II (in this game, the "boom" sound of a completed attack
  precedes the "burning" sound of an attack in progress).  Some player/monster
  weapons have slightly modified firing strengths or rates.  Weapons tend to
  have less horizontal auto-aim ability, and some projectiles are "narrower",
  than their counterparts in PC Doom II.  In GBA Doom II, a minimal burst of
  chaingun fire is typically 1 bullet, versus 2 bullets in most other Doom
  games.  The function of the BFG 9000 is somewhat different here than in most
  other Doom games (the weapon's secondary-attack pattern and range has been
  altered).  Bullet and shotgun pellet impact patterns differ somewhat from
  those in other Doom games.  Monster blood is green instead of red.  Player
  characters do not bleed when injured; the blood-spatter sprites are replaced
  here by "bullet puffs" (small gray sprites used for bullet or shotgun pellet
  impacts on solid surfaces).  No exploding-monster effect (usually seen in PC
  Doom games when, for example, an Imp or Former Human is hit by a rocket).
  Rocket explosions and plasma bursts can trigger impact-activated switches (in
  most other Doom/Doom II games these projectiles will not affect switches).
  Unlike other Doom games, close-range explosions caused by player rockets will
  not push against the player.  In this game muzzle flashes from player weapons
  do not brighten nearby surfaces, as they do in other versions.  Unlike the PC
  Doom games, players can change lateral direction and speed while falling or
  moving through the air.  Hitting the Activate/Use button can still trigger
  the "grunt" sound effect, even when the player character is nowhere near a
  wall, switch, or door.  Certain messages in this game, such as "Find the
  switch to open this door", do not appear in other Doom games.  Some surfaces
  with 1-way transparency are used in this game (a feature missing from many
  other non-computer versions).  "Secret areas" are usually announced (via
  on-screen messages) as a player character enters them.  Monsters which are
  killed by other monsters are not included when calculating the Kills score
  (in all other Doom games, monster deaths are attributed to players regardless
  of how the kill occurred).  Newly acquired weapons or ammo items contain a
  doubled amount of ammunition at all skill levels (in the PC Doom games, the
  standard amount of ammo for each item is doubled when playing at the lowest
  or highest skill levels).  In GBA Doom II, almost all retrievable items on a
  given map level are tallied in the Items score (in most other Doom/Doom II
  games, many retrievable item types are not tallied).  Unlike PC Doom games, a
  player may pick up more than one Computer Map item.  The tally screen shows
  both the time spent on the map, and the map's Par Time.  All major items and
  power-ups will re-spawn in Deathmatch, including Invulnerability Artifacts,
  Blur Artifacts and Megaspheres (in PC Doom games, not all item types will
  re-spawn).  Some symbols and images from the secret maps in PC Doom II are
  altered in the equivalent maps here.  Objects suspended from ceilings (bodies
  or body parts on chains, etc.) do not appear, as they do in the equivalent PC
  Doom II maps.  In most Doom/Doom II games the plasma rifle is swung up and to
  the side for a moment at the end of its firing sequence; in this game the
  weapon always faces forward.  Some item names are misspelled (MEDIKIT spelled
  MEDKIT), or are spelled differently in different places (ARMOR/ARMOUR).

  Notes: In PC Doom II, map 11 is referred to as "CIRCLE OF DEATH" in the tally
  screens, and "'O' OF DESTRUCTION!" in the Automap.
  In GBA Doom II, maps "INDUSTRIAL ZONE" and "THE CHASM" are each split into 2
  separate maps (parts "A" and "B").
  The map numbers used here for GBA Doom II maps are for reference only, and
  are not displayed in the game.

12. TAPWAVE ZODIAC DOOM II
==========================
o The term "Zodiac" in this document applies to either of 2 similar handheld
  Tapwave devices: Zodiac 1 and Zodiac 2.

o A Tapwave Zodiac 2, model T2907USA ("first edition"), was used as the test
  system for the Zodiac Doom II game described in this document.

o Pros: Zodiac Doom II is a nearly direct copy of the v1.9 PC Doom II game, and
  so includes all of the original PC maps and monsters, and almost all of the
  original art, textures, music, etc.  This Zodiac game has fewer changes or
  omissions than GBA Doom II and some other non-computer Doom/Doom II games.
  Decent gameplay and screen-refresh rate.  A game in progress may be saved at
  any point and restored later to the same point.  Saved games retain copious
  information (player location, health, weapon, ammo and armor status, live/
  dead status of all monsters on the map level, etc.).  Game supports 9 screen
  sizes, which also allows the first-person view to be expanded to fill the
  entire screen.  Some analog-control customization allowed ("Move sensitivity"
  and "Turn sensitivity" adjustment options). Includes an "Autorun" option
  (player always runs).  Games played at "Nightmare" skill include re-spawning
  monsters (a feature missing from some non-computer versions).

o Cons: No multiplayer ability.  Although analog-control sensitivity can be
  adjusted, precise movement of the player character can be difficult to
  maintain (for example, it can be overly easy to pivot while attempting to
  move in a straight line).  Some infrequently-encountered flaws exist in the
  original commercial PC Doom II game which were ported unchecked into this
  game, including a program bug that creates nearly-intangible monsters, and a
  bug that can allow a player character to become trapped partially inside
  solid objects when reloading saved games.  Save-game files are stored in RAM,
  and so are preserved only if the RAM remains powered (power can diminish even
  while the unit is "off"), or the files are manually copied to separate media.
  Weapons are cyclic-access only, and weapon choices can be cycled in only one
  direction.  Occasional errors occur when cycling through available weapons
  (weapon cycle may "wrap around" at the wrong point, etc.).  Map name/number
  is not displayed on the Automap screen.

o Miscellaneous: Port by MachineWorks NorthWest LLC.  Memory-card format (SD
  type); formerly also available as a direct download from www.tapwave.com.  32
  map levels, all of which are found in PC Doom II: Hell on Earth.  No "Attract
  mode"; no demo games.  Some sound effects in this game are "pitch shifted" at
  random, which adds some variety to game sounds (this is a feature found in
  the earliest PC Doom releases, but later abandoned).  Cheat codes are allowed
  in games played at "Nightmare" skill.  A "walk through walls" cheat code is
  included (a cheat otherwise found only in the PC games, and Apple iOS Doom).

  screens, and "'O' OF DESTRUCTION!" in the Automap.

13. MICROSOFT XBOX CLASSIC DOOM GAMES
=====================================
o Note: This section refers to Classic Doom games for Microsoft's first Xbox
  console, which is sometimes referred to as the "Original Xbox" or "Old Xbox".

o The Xbox game "Doom 3: Limited Collector's Edition" includes the bonus games
  Ultimate Doom: Thy Flesh Consumed, and Doom II: Hell on Earth.  The Xbox game
  "Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil" includes those same two Classic games, and an
  additional Master Levels game (essentially an extra mapset for Xbox Doom II).
  This document addresses the Classic Ultimate Doom and Doom II games for Xbox;
  For more information about various Master Levels games/Episodes/maps, access:
  http://classicdoom.com/fdoomcmp.htm

o A Microsoft Xbox, model F23-00097, equipped with one standard Xbox controller
  (model K04-00001), was used as the test system for the Xbox Ultimate Doom and
  Xbox Doom II games described in this document.  For testing split-screen
  multiplayer games, additional controllers (K04-00001, K86-00001, third-party)
  were added to the system.

o Pros: The Xbox Ultimate Doom and Doom II games are nearly direct copies of
  the equivalent v1.9 PC games, and so include all of the original PC maps and
  monsters, and almost all of the original art, textures, music, etc.  In
  general, these games have fewer changes or omissions than many other console
  Doom/Doom II games.  Both games support split-screen Deathmatch/Cooperative
  gameplay for 2 to 4 players.  Very fast gameplay and screen-refresh rate in
  both single-player and multiplayer games.  Single-player games in progress
  may be saved at any point and restored later to the same point.  Saved games
  retain copious information (player location, health, weapon, ammo and armor
  status, live/dead status of all monsters on the map level, etc.).  Games
  support 9 screen sizes, and the first-person view can be expanded to fill the
  entire screen.  Games played at "Nightmare" skill will include re-spawning
  monsters (a feature missing from some non-computer versions).

o Cons: Some infrequently-encountered flaws exist in the original commercial PC
  Doom/Doom II games which were ported unchecked into these games, including
  areas on some maps where players may become inadvertently trapped, a program
  bug that creates nearly-intangible monsters, a bug that can allow a player
  character to become stuck partially inside solid objects when reloading saved
  games, and a bug in Doom II where the game can crash if a map-30 save-game
  file is reloaded.  In addition to the flaws ported from the PC games, these
  Xbox games may sometimes freeze or crash where the original PC games would
  not.  Cheat functions can be accidentally activated during play (some common
  gameplay actions have button-use patterns that match certain cheat codes).
  No controller customizing is allowed.  No built-in ability to adjust sound
  effects volume or music volume.  No ability to independently scroll the
  Automap (the Automap display is always in "Follow mode").  No ability to
  select skill level for multiplayer games; Deathmatch and Co-Op games can only
  be played at skill 3 ("Hurt Me Plenty").  Items do not re-spawn in Deathmatch
  games.  Weapons are cyclic-access only (although weapon choices can be cycled
  in both directions).  Some enemy types are not in "fast" mode in games played
  at "Nightmare" skill.  A player cannot get a 100% Kills or Secret score on
  Ultimate Doom map E4M1 ("HELL BENEATH"), due to a switch that was disabled
  when this map was ported from PC Ultimate Doom.  No "Gamma Correction"
  feature or equivalent (however the first-person view tends to be brighter
  than in some other console versions).

o Miscellaneous: Ports by Vicarious Visions.  Xbox DVD format.  The Ultimate
  Doom game contains 37 map levels, 1 of which is not found in PC Ultimate
  Doom; The Doom II game contains 33 map levels, 1 of which is not found in PC
  Doom II: Hell on Earth.  Graphics resolution and quality are virtually
  identical to the original PC games.  In "split screen" mode, the individual
  player screens retain the aspect ratio of a full-sized screen; As such, the
  first-person views do not expand to fill all available space on the display
  device for 2- or 3-player games.  All Episodes of the Ultimate Doom game use
  only one sky/background texture for each map (versus a variety of backgrounds
  in the PC game).  Music tracks in both games play at a slightly different
  rate than the equivalent tracks in the original PC games.  When cycling
  through weapons in Doom II, the double-barrelled "Super Shotgun" weapon slot
  is located between the chain saw and fist (in PC Doom II games, both shotgun
  types share a weapon slot between the pistol and chaingun).  The player can
  select the fist weapon at any time, whether or not a chain saw or Berserk
  Pack has been acquired.  In the first 3 Episodes of the Ultimate Doom game,
  Phobos/Deimos/Hell landscapes are used as the background for the tally
  screens between map levels, showing the player's progress through the various
  stages of each Episode (this art is omitted from some other non-computer Doom
  versions).  Some sound effects in both games are "pitch shifted" at random,
  which adds some variety to game sounds (this is a feature found in the
  earliest PC Doom releases, but later abandoned).  Cheat codes are allowed in
  games played at "Nightmare" skill.  The bonus maps in these games originally
  appeared earlier as third-party WAD files for the PC games.

14. MICROSOFT XBOX 360/XBLA DOOM
================================
o "Doom" for the Xbox 360 is available in disc form, bundled in "Doom 3: BFG
  Edition", and may also be downloaded from the Microsoft Store (an online
  service for various Xbox consoles/devices).  The online version is offered in
  2 forms: "Free Trial", where players can try the game's first map for free,
  and "Full Game", a paid version where all content is unlocked.

o Although this Xbox 360 game is titled "Doom", the actual product is the
  4-Episode update/reissue of Doom, called "The Ultimate Doom".

o A "Premium" Microsoft Xbox 360, model MSK-XBOX360CONSOLE(B), equipped with
  one standard Xbox 360 wireless controller (model X809478-001), was used as
  the test system for the Xbox 360 Doom game described in this document.  For
  testing split-screen multiplayer games, additional identical controllers were
  added to the system.  For testing online multiplayer games, the console was
  connected through the Xbox Live service to an identical console.

o Pros: This Xbox 360 game is a nearly direct copy of PC Ultimate Doom v1.9,
  and so includes all of the original PC maps and monsters, and virtually all
  of the original art, textures, music, etc.  In general, this Xbox 360 game
  has fewer changes or omissions than many other console Doom/Doom II games,
  including the earlier Ultimate Doom port for Original Xbox (bundled with Xbox
  Doom 3 games).  Graphics resolution for this game is higher than that of most
  other commercial Ultimate Doom games (including the original PC version),
  improving the sharpness and detail of sprites and textures at longer ranges.
  Supports split-screen Deathmatch and Cooperative gameplay for 2 to 4 players,
  and full-screen Deathmatch/Cooperative games over Xbox Live.  Very fast
  gameplay and screen-refresh rate in both single-player and same-console
  multiplayer games.  Single-player games in progress may be saved at any point
  and restored later to the same point.  Saved games retain copious information
  (player location, health, weapon, ammo and armor status, live/dead status of
  all monsters on the map level, etc.).  Game supports 11 screen sizes (but
  does not allow the first-person view to be expanded to fill the entire
  screen).  Games played at "Nightmare" skill include re-spawning monsters (a
  feature missing from some non-computer versions).  Patches or updates to this
  product may become available online via Xbox Live.  This game supports 10
  save-game slots per storage device, and the storage device can be specified
  or changed when saving/loading games.  This game can also be played on Xbox
  One consoles via backward compatibility.

o Cons: Some infrequently-encountered flaws exist in the original commercial PC
  game which were ported unchecked into this game, including areas on some
  levels where players may become inadvertently trapped, and a program bug that
  can allow a player character to become stuck partially inside solid objects
  when reloading saved games.  In addition to the flaws ported from the PC
  game, this Xbox 360 game may sometimes freeze where the original PC game
  would not.  No controller customizing allowed.  No ability to independently
  scroll the Automap (the Automap display is always in "Follow mode").  Online
  multiplayer games are currently only available to paying members of Xbox Live
  Gold; the free/Silver membership does not support online play.  Deathmatch
  games are confined to single maps (exit switches/portals are deactivated).
  Weapons are cyclic-access only (although weapon choices can be cycled in both
  directions).  Some enemy types are not in "fast" mode in games played at
  "Nightmare" skill.  No "Gamma Correction" feature or equivalent (however the
  first-person view tends to be brighter than in some other console versions).

o Miscellaneous: Port by Nerve Software and Vicarious Visions.  Available as a
  download (about 23 megabytes) through the Xbox Live online service.  36 map
  levels, all of which are found in PC Ultimate Doom.  As with other Xbox Live
  titles, this game supports the "Achievements" system, which allows players to
  track various accomplishments in the game, for both themselves and other
  players of the game on Xbox Live.  In "split screen" mode, the individual
  player screens retain the aspect ratio of a full-sized screen; As such, the
  first-person views do not expand to fill all available space on the display
  device for 2- or 3-player games.  In Cooperative-mode games, whenever one
  player acquires a key, the same key appears in the inventory of all other
  players.  A player can select the fist weapon at any time, whether or not a
  chain saw or Berserk Pack has been acquired.  In the first 3 Episodes of the
  game, Phobos/Deimos/Hell landscapes are used as the background for the tally
  screens between map levels, showing the player's progress through the various
  stages of each Episode (this art is omitted from some other non-computer Doom
  versions).  Music tracks are remastered in 5.1 Surround Sound, and so sound
  marginally different than the equivalent tracks in the original PC game.
  Some sound effects in this game are "pitch shifted" at random, which adds
  some variety to game sounds (this is a feature found in the earliest PC Doom
  releases, but later abandoned).  No built-in cheat codes.

  Notes: In both games, the Episode 3 Mission 7 map is referred to as "GATE TO
  LIMBO" in the tally screens, and "LIMBO" in the Automap.

15. MICROSOFT XBOX 360/XBLA DOOM II
===================================
o "Doom II" for Xbox 360/XBLA includes 2 games/Episodes ("Hell on Earth" and
  "No Rest for the Living") in a single package.  This is available in disc
  form, bundled in "Doom 3: BFG Edition", and may also be downloaded from the
  Microsoft Store (an online service for various Xbox consoles/devices).  The
  online version is offered in 2 forms: "Free Trial", where players can try the
  first map of either Episode for free, and "Full Game", a paid version where
  all content is unlocked.

o A "Premium" Microsoft Xbox 360, model MSK-XBOX360CONSOLE(B), equipped with
  one standard Xbox 360 wireless controller (model X809478-001), was used as
  the test system for the Xbox 360 Doom II game described in this document.
  For testing split-screen multiplayer games, additional identical controllers
  were added to the system.  For testing online multiplayer games, the console
  was connected through the Xbox Live service to an identical console.

o Pros: This Xbox 360 title features a nearly direct copy of PC Doom II v1.9
  (and so includes all of the original PC maps and monsters, and virtually all
  of the original art, textures, music, etc.), and also includes an additional
  and separate 9-map Episode, "No Rest for the Living".  In general, Xbox 360
  Doom II has fewer changes or omissions than other console/handheld Doom II
  games, including the Doom II port for Original Xbox (bundled with Xbox Doom 3
  games).  Graphics resolution for this game is higher than that of most other
  commercial Doom II games (including the original PC version), improving the
  sharpness and detail of sprites and textures at longer ranges.  Supports
  split-screen Deathmatch and Cooperative gameplay for 2 to 4 players, and
  full-screen Deathmatch/Cooperative games over Xbox Live.  Very fast gameplay
  and screen-refresh rate in both single-player and same-console multiplayer
  games.  Single-player games in progress may be saved at any point and
  restored later to the same point.  Saved games retain copious information
  (player location, health, weapon, ammo and armor status, live/dead status of
  all monsters on the map level, etc.).  Game supports 11 screen sizes (but
  does not allow the first-person view to be expanded to fill the entire
  screen).  Games played at "Nightmare" skill include re-spawning monsters (a
  feature missing from some non-computer versions).  Includes an "Auto-run"
  option (player always runs).  Patches/updates to this product may become
  available via Xbox Live.  This game supports 10 save-game slots per storage
  device, and the storage device can be specified or changed when saving/
  loading games.  Weapons are cyclic-access (in 2 directions), and some may
  also be accessed directly by category type (bullet, pellet, energy, etc.) via
  the controller's D-pad.  Gameplay sessions are automatically recorded
  (although recordings can be flawed), and the 10 highest-scoring sessions on
  the Xbox Live Leaderboards are preserved, and may be watched again from the
  Leaderboard menu screen.  This game can also be played on Xbox One consoles
  via backward compatibility.

o Cons: Some infrequently-encountered flaws exist in the original commercial PC
  game which were ported unchecked into this game, including areas on some
  levels where players may become inadvertently trapped, and a program bug that
  can allow a player character to become stuck partially inside solid objects
  when reloading saved games.  In addition to the flaws ported from the PC
  game, this Xbox 360 game may sometimes freeze where the original PC game
  would not.  No controller customizing allowed.  No ability to independently
  scroll the Automap (the Automap display is always in "Follow mode").  Online
  multiplayer games are currently only available to paying members of Xbox Live
  Gold; the free/Silver membership does not support online play.  Deathmatch
  games are confined to single maps (exit switches/portals are deactivated).
  Some enemy types are not in "fast" mode in games played at "Nightmare" skill.
  No "Gamma Correction" feature or equivalent (however the first-person view
  tends to be brighter than in some other console versions).  Recorded gameplay
  sessions ("demos") may de-sync when replaying, causing player characters to
  appear to move and shoot at random.  In 2012 a re-issue of this Doom II game
  made changes to the "Hell on Earth" secret levels, including replacing all
  "SS Officer" enemies with Zombiemen, and that change can cause de-syncs in
  Cooperative games if both players are not using the same version of the game.

o Miscellaneous: Port and additional content by Nerve Software.  Available as a
  download (about 35 megabytes) through the Xbox Live online service.  41 map
  levels, total, 32 of which are found in original PC Doom II: Hell on Earth.
  As with other Xbox Live titles, this game supports the "Achievements" system,
  which allows players to track various accomplishments in the game, for both
  themselves and other players of the game on Xbox Live.  In "split screen"
  mode, the individual player screens retain the aspect ratio of a full-sized
  screen; As such, the first-person views do not expand to fill all available
  space on the display device for 2- or 3-player games.  In Cooperative-mode
  games, whenever one player acquires a key, the same key appears in the
  inventory of all other players.  A player can select the fist weapon at any
  time, whether or not a chain saw or Berserk Pack has been acquired.  Recently
  finished gameplay sessions on the player's Xbox 360 will temporarily replace
  the built-in demos that are shown during any idle time between games.  Music
  tracks are remastered in 5.1 Surround Sound, and sound marginally different
  (in addition to being slower) than the equivalent tracks in the original PC
  game.  Many sound effects in this game are "pitch shifted" at random, which
  adds some variety to game sounds (this is a feature found in the earliest PC
  Doom games, but later abandoned).  The red plus-shaped symbol on health
  power-ups has been replaced in this version by a red-and-white pill symbol.
  No built-in cheat codes.

16. SONY PLAYSTATION 3 DOOM
===========================
o "Doom" for the Sony PlayStation 3 ("PS3") is bundled in the software packages
  "Doom 3: BFG Edition" and "Doom Classic Complete".  These are available for
  purchase as digital downloads from the PlayStation Store (an online service
  for various Sony consoles/devices).  "Doom 3: BFG Edition" is also available
  in physical-disc form.

o Although this Sony PS3 game is titled "Doom" in places, the actual product is
  the 4-Episode update/reissue of Doom, called "The Ultimate Doom".

o The PS3 game bundle "Doom Classic Complete" includes Ultimate Doom, Doom II:
  Hell on Earth, Doom II: No Rest for the Living, Final Doom (TNT/Evilution,
  and The Plutonia Experiment), and the Master Levels as a stand-alone Episode.
  This document addresses the Classic Ultimate Doom and Doom II games for PS3;
  For more information about various Final Doom and Master Levels games access:
  http://classicdoom.com/fdoomcmp.htm

o A Sony PlayStation 3 ("PS3"), model CECHK01, equipped with one standard PS3
  DualShock 3 Sixaxis wireless controller (model CECHZC2U), was used as the
  test system for the PS3 Doom game described in this document.  For testing
  split-screen multiplayer games, additional PS3 controllers were added to the
  system.  For testing online multiplayer games, the console was connected
  through the PlayStation Network ("PSN") to an identical console.

o Pros: This PS3 game is a nearly direct copy of PC Ultimate Doom v1.9, and so
  includes all of the original PC maps and monsters, and virtually all of the
  original art, textures, music, etc.  In general, this PS3 game has fewer
  changes or omissions than many other console Doom/Doom II games.  Graphics
  resolution is higher than that of most other commercial Ultimate Doom games
  (including the original PC version), improving the sharpness and detail of
  sprites and textures at longer ranges.  Supports split-screen Deathmatch and
  Cooperative gameplay for 2 to 4 players, and full-screen Deathmatch/
  Cooperative games over PlayStation Network ("PSN").  Very fast gameplay and
  screen-refresh rate in both single-player and same-console multiplayer games.
  Single-player games in progress may be saved at any point and restored later
  to the same point.  Saved games retain copious information (player location,
  health, weapon, ammo and armor status, live/dead status of all monsters on
  the map level, etc.).  Game supports 16 screen sizes (but does not allow the
  first-person view to be expanded to fill the entire screen).  Games played at
  "Nightmare" skill include re-spawning monsters (a feature missing from some
  non-computer versions).  Includes an "Always Run" option (player is always in
  Run mode), and an option to turn controller vibration on/off.  Patches or
  updates to the product may become available via PlayStation Network.  Game
  allows storage and management of a large number of save-game files (far more
  than other versions), and the displayed file information includes map name,
  Difficulty, play time, and a timestamp for the file itself.  All weapons are
  cyclic-access (in 2 directions), and some may also be accessed directly by
  category type (bullet, pellet, energy, etc.) via the controller's D-pad.
  Deathmatch games may be set to an unlimited time duration (versus a 20-minute
  maximum in some other console versions).  Cooperative games have a "Friendly
  fire" option that can be toggled on/off.

o Cons: Some infrequently-encountered flaws exist in the original commercial PC
  game which were ported unchecked into this game, including areas on some
  levels where players may become inadvertently trapped, and a program bug that
  can allow a player character to become stuck partially inside solid objects
  when reloading saved games.  No controller customizing allowed.  The process
  of saving or loading a save-game file is unusually slow.  No ability to
  independently scroll the Automap (the Automap display is always in "Follow
  mode").  Deathmatch games are confined to single maps (exit switches/portals
  are deactivated).  Some enemy types are not in "fast" mode in games played at
  "Nightmare" skill.  No "Gamma Correction" feature or equivalent (however the
  first-person view tends to be brighter than in some other console versions).

o Miscellaneous: Port by id Software and Bethesda Softworks.  36 map levels,
  all of which are found in PC Ultimate Doom.  As with other PS3 titles, this
  game supports the "Trophies" system, which allows players to track various
  accomplishments in the game, for both themselves and other players of the
  game on PSN.  In "split screen" mode, the individual player screens retain
  the aspect ratio of a full-sized screen; As such, the first-person views do
  not expand to fill all available space on the display device for 2- or
  3-player games.  In Cooperative-mode games, whenever one player acquires a
  key, the same key appears in the inventory of all other players.  A player
  can select the fist weapon at any time, whether or not a chain saw or Berserk
  Pack has been acquired.  In the first 3 Episodes of the game, Phobos/Deimos/
  Hell landscapes are used as the background for the tally screens between map
  levels, showing the player's progress through the various stages of each
  Episode (this art is omitted from some other non-computer Doom versions).
  Music tracks are remastered in 5.1 Surround Sound, and so sound marginally
  different than the equivalent tracks in the original PC game.  Some sound
  effects in this game are "pitch shifted" at random, which adds some variety
  to game sounds (this is a feature found in the earliest PC Doom releases, but
  later abandoned).  The red plus-shaped symbol on health power-ups has been
  replaced in this version by a red-and-white pill symbol.  No built-in cheat
  codes.

17. SONY PLAYSTATION 3 DOOM II
==============================
o "Doom II" for Sony PlayStation 3 ("PS3") is bundled in the software packages
  "Doom 3: BFG Edition" and "Doom Classic Complete".  These are available for
  purchase as a digital download from the PlayStation Store (an online service
  for various Sony consoles/devices).  "Doom 3: BFG Edition" is also available

  then in Doom II games for PS3, and in some repackages/updates of the PC game.
  All editions of this Episode include the same 9 maps.

18. APPLE IOS DOOM CLASSIC
==========================
o "iOS" is an operating system by Apple Incorporated for their mobile devices
  (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, etc.).  "Doom Classic" for Apple iOS (also called
  "Apple iOS Doom" or "iOS Doom" in this document) is a modified port of the
  4-Episode PC game Ultimate Doom.

o A third-generation 32GB Apple iPod touch, model PC008LL, was used as the test
  device for the Apple iOS Doom game described in this document.  For testing
  multiplayer games this device was connected wirelessly to a second, identical
  iPod touch.

o Pros: This game is a close copy of PC Ultimate Doom v1.9, and so includes all
  of the original PC maps and monsters, and virtually all of the original art,
  textures, music, etc.  In general, this game has fewer changes or omissions
  than many other console/handheld Doom games.  Multiplayer ability, allowing
  2 to 4 players in Deathmatch and Cooperative games via short-range wireless
  connection.  Extensive control customization allowed.  Comparatively smooth,
  high-resolution graphics produced via dynamic antialiasing.  The "pixelation"
  effect (a drop in graphics resolution seen in other Doom games as the player
  character approaches a surface or object) is notably reduced here.  Very good
  gameplay and screen-refresh rate.  A game in progress may be saved at any
  point (but only a single save-game slot is available) and then restored later
  to the same point.  Saved games retain copious information (player location,
  health, weapon, ammo and armor status, live/dead status of all monsters on
  the map level, etc.).  During a game in progress, weapons are direct-access
  (after a single tap on the touchscreen to bring up a weapons menu).  Built-in
  ability to listen to alternative audio on the device (music files, etc.) when
  playing the game.  In the status bar, current ammo levels and ammo limits are
  always shown for all weapons (in some console Doom games, only the currently
  selected weapon has an ammo level displayed).  On the Automap screen, zooming
  and scrolling functions are very quick and responsive.  Apple iOS Doom has
  the greatest number and variety of built-in cheat codes among all commercial
  Classic Doom/Doom II games.

o Cons: Some infrequently-encountered flaws exist in the original commercial PC
  Doom/Ultimate Doom game which were ported unchecked into this game, including
  areas on some map levels where players may become inadvertently trapped.  No
  documentation, background story, or gameplay information is included with the
  download.  Because the touchscreen itself is used as the control interface,
  some part of the first-person view is always obscured during active gameplay.
  Only one save-game slot is available, and this slot is automatically written
  to whenever a player moves between map levels, overwriting any manually-saved
  game.  No ability to play in Automap mode (gameplay is always paused while
  the Automap screen is displayed).  When running, the game may override the
  device's optional "Auto-Lock" and "Passcode Lock" settings (used for putting
  the device in a sleep/password-protected mode if it remains unattended for a
  specified amount of time).

o Miscellaneous: Port by John Carmack and the PrBoom project team.  Available
  as a downloadable application (or "App") via Apple Inc.'s iTunes/App Store.
  36 map levels, all of which are found in PC Ultimate Doom.  Unlike most other
  commercial Doom games, a player may choose any map to start a new game on.
  This game keeps a running tally of certain player achievements on each map,
  including whether or not the player played that map, got a 100% Kills or
  Secrets score, and/or beat that map's Par Time.  No "Nightmare" skill level.
  Automap screen provides more color-coded information than the original PC
  games, including specific color designation for key-locked doors, secret
  areas, and differentiation for object types when using Automap cheat codes.
  In this game, "blurred" objects are translucent and faded, but otherwise
  maintain their normal colors and surface features (in the PC games, "blurred"
  objects, when visible, are a translucent gray, with a flat, flowing/scrambled
  surface).  A player can select the fist weapon at any time, whether or not a
  chain saw or Berserk Pack has been acquired.  In the first 3 Episodes of the
  game, Phobos/Deimos/Hell landscapes are used as the background for the tally
  screens between map levels, showing the player's progress through the various
  stages of each Episode (this art is omitted from some other non-computer Doom
  versions).  Some sound effects are "pitch shifted" at random, which adds some
  variety to game sounds (this is a feature found in the earliest PC Doom
  releases, but later abandoned).  An option has been added to allow a player

  Unlike other console/handheld Doom games, Doom 64 is not a copy of a PC game.
  GBA Doom II uses 2 separate "half-maps" for each of 2 copied PC Doom II maps.
  The Xbox 360 and PS3 entries above address only the "Hell on Earth" Episodes.
  Starting in 2012 Zombiemen replace "SS Officers" in some versions of Doom II.

  Notes: This table gives an overview of the Classic-game Episodes appearing in
  the retail Doom products referenced in this document.  (For more information,
  see the relevant game sections and map-comparison tables in this document.)
  PC Doom (1993 release) has 3 Episodes of 9 maps each, for a total of 27 maps;
  PC Ultimate Doom includes those same 3 Episodes, plus a fourth 9-map Episode
  (Thy Flesh Consumed), for a total of 36 maps.  Note that the "Ultimate Doom"
  column in this table refers only to the 9 maps of Episode 4.
  In the "Doom II" column above, "HOE" is "Hell on Earth" (the original 32-map
  Episode), and "NRFTL" is "No Rest for the Living" (a newer 9-map Episode).
  The "Original-Xbox Doom 3" games listed here are "Doom 3: Limited Collector's

  Notes: "PC DOOM GAMES" includes Doom 1, Ultimate Doom, Doom II, and Doom 95;
  "XBOX DOOM GAMES" refers only to Old/Original-Xbox Classic Doom games.
  The PS3, SNES and Xbox 360 games have no built-in cheats so are not included.
  The "sound mix" ("high-resolution mixing") code, the "mass kill" ("destroy
  all monsters") code, and the "quiet mode" ("monsters cannot detect quiet
  player") code in the PC-games category indicate PC games played with Doom 95.
  In PS1 and Saturn Doom, the add-ammo code only adds keys if they can be used.
  In 3DO Doom, a player cannot warp to another map level during a game in
  progress; However, a cheat code is available that allows a player to start
  new games on any map except map 24.
  In PS1 and Saturn Doom games, maps 55 through 59 cannot be warped to from any
  map.  In Doom 64 a player may only warp to maps 1 through 27, or warp to any
  current map to restart on it.  In GBA Doom a player can only warp to the next
  map from the current map, or warp 10 maps beyond the current map.  In the
  Xbox games secret/bonus maps are not accessible via the Warp/exit-level code.
