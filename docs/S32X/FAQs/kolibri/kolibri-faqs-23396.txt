# 1) Introduction                                       #

The first question I'm sure a lot of people are going to
have, considering the Kolibri was never a widely know of 
game, is just what is Kolibri?  To put it simply it's an 
attempt to try something new with the old side scrolling 
shooting space ship game style.  Instead of a ship you
are a hummingbird fighting giant insects to save nature.
While there are a few side scrolling levels for the most
part you are free roaming solving puzzles or mazes to get
to the end of the level.  

It was never widely heard of thanks to it being released 
for the Sega 32x, a console released as a stop gap between 
the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and the Sega Saturn (competitor 
to the Sony Playstation) which failed for various reasons 
before it even really launched.

It was made by Novotrade, which you may or may not recognize
as the makers of Ecco the Dolphin, which achieved a following
during the Mega Drive/Genesis days, and now has a sequel
on the Dreamcast and Playstation 2.  There are many similar
feeling themes with the Ecco the Dolphin series of games.

Kolibri, like Ecco, probably isn't for everybody.  You have to
have the ability to work though very hard puzzles to enjoy 
it.  However I hope my hints will help people playing not to
get totally stuck (It took me 4 months playing off and on
with no help to figure out all the levels) 

I started playing since I'm a big fan of the Ecco the Dolphin
games, and I've heard Kolibri mentioned by Ecco fans many times.
Since I've started playing I've become a convert and become
hooked enough to figure out the entire game with no instructions
or help,  Which in itself shows how different it is to most 
shoot em ups of this type - I don't usually play this type of
game.  I just wish they had developed some of the elements like
the storyline more - I think it could have be even better 
with the changes to the genre taken further, but that said
I still love the game.

Well if you think it's worth taking a look, there are 
instructions further on about how you might get to play.
Or if you are playing it, my information should hopefully
make things a lot more fun if you are lost as to how some
things work (It took me ages to work some stuff out without
a manual) or pulling your hair out on a puzzle...

# 2) Storyline                                          #
#########################################################

EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HERO

Earth is a living organism. Each lifeform on Earth is a 
cell of the greater whole. Deep inside the planet, a 
mysterous ancient crystal hums, radiates and energizes 
Earth with its powerful life force.

THe ancient crystal is a gift from afar, Eons ago, deep 
in an unknown sector of the universe, a more highly evolved 
living planet exploded. The crystal with its mysterious 
life force was hurled into space. It rocketed towards 
Earth and buried itself deep in the planet's core.

With this new energy, the young Earth began to breathe. 
The crystal was the heart that Earth needed to become 
alive! For millions of years, the crystal worked beneath 
Earth's crust, fueling evolution with its harmonious energies.

A twin to the cyrstal had also been hurled into space. 
This dark cyrstal had been irradiated by the massive 
planetary explosion. It spent ages falling through the 
vastness of space, festering, pulsing and swelling with 
infection. Finally, the malignant crystal sped Earthward 
and crashed into the planet.

Now with room to spread, the dark crystal spewed its 
malignant force into the Earth. Like the worst pestilence, 
the cancerous growth invaded nature. It devoured Earth's 
lifeforms, changing them into gray, diseased shadows. Each 
lifefom, each cell of Earth's being, became a cancerous 
growth. Starved of the ancient crystal's strength, nature's 
works of art sickened. Earth began to die.

EARTH CRYSTAL'S LAST GASP

Deep underground, the Earth crystal felt the death pangs. 
The engulfing disease moved swiftly, nearly oblitating the 
crystal's power. With its dying strength, the Earth crystal 
burrowed to the surface.

At that moment, Kolibri the hummingbird flew by. Sensing 
pure life, the Earth crystal infused the small bird with 
its strength, Kolibri became the antibody, empowered to 
combat the malignant evil.

LEAVING HOME MEADOW

Kolibri's world is about to change. As the little hummer 
cruises his home meadow, use the D-pad to explore with him. 
Drink from the orange flower that has no other hummingbirds 
defending it to start the game. While Kolibri refreshes 
himself with nectar, fate steps in...

Kolibri must destroy the mutated lifeforms that infest 
Earth. He must defeat the dark crystal's evil and restore 
the Earth crystal's harmonious energy.

One of the Earth's smallest creature has become her 
mightiest hope. But as what cost?

# 3) Controls                                           #
#########################################################

By default the controls are (in game);

D-pad - Move in pressed direction
	(Explains itself I think)
A Button - Special
	 Has three possible uses;
	1) It can be used in front of a pollen laden flower 
	to drink from it, producing a health power up. 
	(Early levels only)
	2) If you find a Wall Breaker Pod you can fire one 
	wallbreaker per wallbreaker pod picked up. Their 
	main use is to destroy a special barrier in some 
	levels that blocks off parts of the level (Common 
	puzzle later on) but if you have more than one of 
	them the spare ones can be used as a super weapon 
	which bounces around the screen taking out 
	everthing on it.
	3) If you pick up a energy field pod you can press 
	and hold A to powerup a shield about you. You will 
	lose the shield as soon as you release A and it 
	takes a few seconds to charge up. Once it is in 
	place every one of the 'sparks' will automatically 
	attack enemies of shots about it hit you protecting 
	you. It's great for getting through hard spots but 
	you only get one per pod so use them wisely!
 
B Button - Fire Weapon
	Fires the weapon you currently have. The exact
	effect resulting depends on what weapon you have.
	See the Items/Weapons section for more details.
	Also you can hold it down for rapid fire and while 
	held you won't change direction while moving (unless 
	changed under options)
C Button - Speed Burst
	When pressed makes you move in sudden burst in the 
	direction pressed on the d-pad.  

Start Button - pauses game

# 4) Options                                            #
#########################################################

When you start the game there are 3 options you can take;

Start a new game
	(Starts a new game from the start)
Options
	(Allows you to change how the game plays)
Password
	(Enter a password to start at a later level)

Options and Password both take you to a sub menu
(Press start to return the main menu when done)
 Under Options you can set;
  1) Game difficulty
	(Easy, Normal or Hard)
  2) 1 or 2 players
	(With two players there are two Humming birds
	that share one screen and work together)
  3) ABC button actions
  4) Hold direction while firing / Change direction while
	firing
	(This controls if you want to change the direction
	you point if you press another direction while
	you are holding fire down)
  5) Burst speed (fast/normal)
  6) Choose to turn on or off Music and Sound Effects
  7) Sound Test
	(Select a track with left/right and press A to play)

On the password screen you can enter a password you got given 
at the start of a level to start there rather than at the
start of the game.  If it is accepted you will return to the 
main menu and the "Start a new game" option will have the level 
name of the password you entered in it.

# 5) Items/Weapons                                      #
#########################################################

It should be noted I don't know official names for any
of these so I'm making them up as I go.

Good Items;
   Earth Crystal
	Gives you the power to fight at the start of the game 
	and after that whenever you encounter it in a level 
	constantly showers out weapon pods so it is very handy 
	for getting the weapon you want, as you can always pick 
	your favourite weapon by waiting long enough.
   Milestone
	 Looks like an overgrown version of the Earth crystal. 
	If you touch it you will see an imprint of Kolibri 
	appear in it - this means you will restart at that 
	point in the game if you die rather than the start of 
	the level. However you can only save once so save carefully.
   Wall Breaker Pods
	In certain levels these can be found. If you pick them 
	up you can use them to pass a barrier later in the level
	(Use A is fire them)
   Health Pod
	Looks like a black ball with two orbiting fireballs,
	restores one unit of health.  Can be found by destroying
	enemies or in flowers in early levels.
   Pollen Flower
	Looks like any other flower but has 'pollen' coming from
	the tip (you'll know it when you see it). Press A in
	front of it and a Health Up will fly out of it for you
	to grab.
   Ring 
	When picked up surrounds Kolibri and protects you from 
	one hit (maximum of one can be held at a time) 
   Energy Field Pod
	 Looks like a ball with a chromosome in it (Sort of like 
	a crushed X if you don't know what a chromosome is) you 
	can press and hold A to powerup a shield about you. You 
	will lose the shield as soon as you release A and it 
	takes a few seconds to charge up. Once it is in place 
	every one of the 'sparks' will take one hit for you. It's 
	great for getting through hard spots but you only get one 
	per pod so use them wisely! Also note you can save them up 
	but the number you have *isn't* saved in your password so 
	if you die you lose them all.
   Slow-Mo Pod
	Looks like a bubble of water that bursts when you touch 
	it. This slows enemy movement speed which can greatly help 
	in avoiding incoming fire and taking out enemies.
   Hummingbirds
	In several early levels there are fellow hummingbirds 
	present, they don't do anything though.
   Butterflies 
	In several early levels there are butterflies present, 
	they don't do anything though.
Bad Items;
   Toad
	Can be hard to spot as it blends into the background.
	Probably technically an enemy but I'll include it here
	as it can't move and isn't like other enemies as it is
	instant kill and impossible to escape if it gets you
	hooked with it's tongue.
   Chameleon
	Just like the Toad but easier to see and with a longer 
	range tongue.
   Chain Ball
	Red Globe with a spiky tail that spins around it.
	Not exactly an enemy, but I'll call it bad as it can
	hurt you.  It's use is to break through barriers on
	some levels.  It explodes if hit by most weapons but 
	if hit by the weapon that sends out non honing rings, or
	the weapon that fires a single slow honing blue ball, 
	it can be pushed along rather than exploded, if it is
	hit lightly.  That can be used to push it up against
	a barrier before using it to destroy it by blowing it up.
   Water Drops
	These fall from the roof of caves - small ones do nothing
	but a large one will crush you.  As soon as you see
	small ones watch out, as a large one may suddenly fall next.
   Rock Barrier
	These can be destroyed with either a fireball, or with a
	exploded chain ball, depending on the barrier to reach
	new areas.
   Homing Globe
	Looks like a powerup but filled a darkish golden colour.
	Flying snake like enemies release these - they follow you
	around slowly, hurting you if you they hit you.

Weapons;
   Default
	This is the weapon you start with. It fires a tiny
	ball that goes the direction you point (non honing)
	at a slow rate. Needless to say useless, get another
	weapon as soon as you can! 
   Laser
	You get this from a see-through powerup with a 
	pulsating orange loop in the middle.  It fires
	shots that hone in on enemies automatically, it's
	quite powerful and my personal favourite.
   Blue Ball Single Shot
	You get this from a see-through powerup with a
	yellow triangle in the middle. It shoots a rapid
	firing series of blue balls with yellow centers.
	Not very powerful but it can be used to push an 
	item in later puzzles without blowing it up before you
	want it to.  This has an advantage over the Fire rings
	as it can push that item up and down - not just left 
	to right.
   Yellow bombs
	You get this from a powerup that is filled dark red.
	It sends out a stream of shots that explode a few
	bird lengths from you, sending out a semi circle of
	smaller shot which makes it almost impossible for
	anything to get past it - but it only goes one direction
	at a time, so you have to be on the alert to use it well. 
   Fire Chain
	You get this from a see-through powerup with a
	blue line running through it.  As soon as you get it
	you will see a string of glowing balls form and string 
	out from you.  They will automatically detach
	and fire at any enemy near you before returning to you.
	It has a *big* bonus of staying if you get another 
	weapon so you can use it with another to double your
	firepower.
	(Another personal favourite)
   Blue Multishot
	You get this from a see-through powerup with a
	blue ball flying about inside it.  This fires out a three
	way multishot of blue balls at high speed but
	they don't hone in on enemies automatically.
   Fire Rings
	You get this from a see-through powerup with a
	yellow circle inside it.  It sends out in the direction
	you face a series of rings. They don't hone in but
	it has a secondary use - it can be used to push an 
	item in later puzzles without blowing it up before you
	want it to.

# 6) Hints / How to Play                                #
#########################################################

How to play;

There are a few things that aren't so obvious when you first
play.  Firstly Kolibri's health bar is hidden most of the 
time and only shows up when you either get hurt or gain 
health.  When you do you will see a series of miniature 
Kolibris flying about you - the number of them shows the 
number of hit points you have left (up to a maximum of 4)

There are a number of different level types on Kolibri;
 Starting out you are in a storyline level - there are no
 enemies that hurt you, bar a toad that can eat you.  The 
 other hummingbirds are hording all the flowers and won't 
 let you near them.  Find the flower by itself and feed there
 (Special - by default A), the screen will go dark and you 
 will see meteorites crashing to Earth, then crystals fly 
 into you from the good crystal as you are recruited to fight
 against the evil crystals.

 The first few levels are to get back the flowers - you need
 to explore the levels and destroy all insects by the flowers
 so the hummingbirds can come back to them (the flowers
 get their colours back when freed)  After every flower group
 is freed you have completed the level.

 Next you have area type level when you need to eliminate every
 enemy in a section of the level before a giant bug blocking
 your path becomes fightable allowing you access to the next
 section.

 You then have the generic scrolling levels where you just
 have to follow the screen and survive all the hazards you come
 across until the end of the level.

 Finally we have free roaming puzzle levels where you have to 
 explore the level and solve puzzles to access to new areas.
 They generally come in two types but there are a few other puzzles
 out there but they are more rare.  The first of the two types are
 firstly having to find a group of Wall Breaker pods
 and then finding a barrier and using them (press A) to destroy it.
 The second type is pushing a Chain Ball around it with either  
 Fire Rings or blue single shots. If you hit it very 
 lightly with only one or two shots every few seconds it will 
 move without blowing up (hitting the tail seems to increase
 the chances you will blow it up) When you get it pushed up against 
 a barrier, blow it up with another a stream of fast shots
 destroying the barrier.        

 Use special items that you can get in later levels such as 
 Energy Fields and Wall Breakers to get through sections you find
 hard to fight through.

# 8) Walkthrough                                        #
#########################################################

Introduction
	Not Strictly a level but people new to the game 
	get lost here.  Go to the flower with no humming
	birds near it at the bottom to the right and feed
	from it (A) to start the game running.

1) Warning Signs
	You start near a good crystal - get your favourite
	weapon from it and then just eliminate the enemies
	holding the flowers along the bottom of the level
	to clear the first level.
2) Rescue 
	Head up slightly and grab a ring then head
	down and clear enemies off the flowers as you 
	go.  Then go across the bottom and up the left side 
	clearing enemies as you go.  Once you get all the 
	flowers cleared you will exit the level. 
3) Eruption 
	This level is divided into a series of areas with 
	enemies then a Bloat Bug that blocks your path until
	you destroy all the enemies in the previous area.  
	Just go up/down and left/right shooting enemies - when
	they are all gone the Bloat Bug will fly at you and you will
	be able to fight it - destroy it to get access to the
	next level.  Repeat the process until you get to 
	the end of the level (fly into the arrows against 
	the right screen).
4) Infestation
	This level auto scrolls to the right - you exit the 
	level when it reaches the far right.  You just have 
	to survive to get there through many waves of enemies.
5) Expiry
	This is the first puzzle type level in the game. Start 
	by flying from the right of the level where you start
	to the left (be careful not to get pulled down by the
	current going down by the waterfall half way)  At the
	far left you will find a Slow-Mo Pod and a group of
	Wall Breaker Pods.  Collect the pods and then
	head right back to the waterfall and head down it.  At
	the bottom there is a Earth crystal and an air current
	blowing from the left.  Head into it and burst with C
	to fight through it's middle (it's hard but possible - 
	the hardest thing is avoiding the chameleon near the 
	passage top.  Once though head down and left then press
	A next to the barrier to use the Wall Breaker to break 
	through and exit the level.  (Just below the barrier
	for the exit is some Energy Field Pods if you want to 
	get them.)
6) Metastasis 
	This level is like 'Infestation', but more complicated
	as the screen goes up and down as well as forwards and
	back as it scrolls about the level.  There are several 
	toads and other new dangers to avoid as you travel about.
	Practice will get you through to the end of the level.
7)  New Infection 	
	Fly down at the first chance you get and head down 
	avoiding the toad and chameleon, keep going till you hit the 
	bottom and grab a ring.  Then follow the bottom to the
	right, up slightly then continue as far right as you
	can go.  You will see a group of Wall Breakers at the bottom 
	just below a series of water drops falling from the 
	roof.  Watch out! There is a large one that falls right 
	through the Wall Breaker Pods, dodge it and get the pods.
	Return to near the start where you first headed down and
	this time head right.  Follow the upper roof until you
	see a barrier - press A to use the Wall Breakers to break
	through it and exit the level.
8)  Deep Seeding 	
	Head up and to the right. Avoid the plant and get whatever
	weapon you want from the Earth crystal.  Continue up and
	shoot through the barrier to get the ring.  Don't pass
	the chameleon yet - head right just below it until you
	find the Wall Breaker Pods and then return to here. To get past
	the chameleon you need to move to just out of it's range
	so it will try to it you, and miss - then quickly zoom
	past while it's tongue is rolling back.  There is a Slow-Mo
	Pod to the left and some Energy Field Pods above if you
	want them. Then head to the right and be very careful
	once you pass the toad - water drops will start to fall 
	including a few large ones you must avoid.  Dodge through
	them and at the end of the passage go down, use the Wall
	Breakers to pass the barrier.  Then head right, and up to 
	the very top to exit the level.
9)  Plains Infection 	
	This level is a return to simple side scrolling action.  Just
	grab a weapon at the Earth crystal at the start and grab all 
	the rings you see to help you survive until the end.
10) Terra Lesion 	
	A return to the area based level type of play.  Wipe all the
	enemies out as you proceed so you can fight the Bloat Bug and 
	access the next area.  Repeat until you reach the end.
11) Terra Decay 	
	This level is free roaming but you must stick with a mission
	to complete the level.  Follow the enemy (Spikey) you see in 
	front of you at the start of the level (you can't hurt him) 
	through the level, when he gets to the end the entrance will 
	open for him.  Use that opportunity to follow him through and
	exit the level. 
12) Cold Entrance 	
	A return to the puzzle solving levels.  Head right and shoot
	the enemies to lower the barrier so you can grab the Wall 
	Breaker Pods. Head back left and down the passage you just 
	passed over. Dodge the rock moving backwards and forwards 
	across the passage, get any weapon you want from the Earth 
	crystal. Then continue down, at the bottom head left.  Use 
	the Wall Breakers to destroy the barrier, you will see a 
	bouncing red rock just beyond it - shoot it to push it into 
	the next barrier destroying it. Then head up to the exit.
13) Dark Cavity 	
	Head left and destroy the scorpion, grab a ring from above
	then continue left.  Destroy the enemies to drop the barrier
	you can find a Slow-Mo Pod below it. Continue left, then 
	rush up through the gaps in the rocks avoiding the water 
	drops.  Grab the shield at the top left of the screen. Then 
	head to the right at the top then down (grab the Energy Field 
	Pod behind one of the spiders if you want) and then right 
	again. Head up avoiding the water drops then head left.  
	Destroy the enemies to bring down the barrier and get the 
	Wall Breaker Pods (plus the Energy Field Pods with them if 
	you want) then retrace your steps back right.
	Down, right and up - look carefully behind a spider on the 
	right wall, it is guarding a barrier.  Use the Wall Breakers 
	to destroy the barrier and continue right past it into another
	passage, follow that one right to exit the level. 
	
14) Dark Obstruction 	
	Welcome to one of the largest levels which is thankfully
	make easier by the appearance of the first restart points.
	To start the level you are faced with a new puzzle skill
	to learn.  Just below your starting point you will see a
	Chain Ball (See the bad item section for more information
	on this type of puzzle) Pick your weapon of choice for this
	puzzle from the good crystal to the right,
	Then push the Chain Ball up against the barrier and hit 
	it fast to blow it up destroying the barrier.  Fly to the 
	left into the passage behind it, (grab the Energy Field 
	Pods if you want). Continue left shooting your way through
	three barriers. You will then come into a chamber with a 
	Earth crystal, a group of Wall Breaker Pods under a barrier 
	surrounded by enemies and an up flowing a air current at 
	the far side.  Needless to say fight your way through the 
	enemies get the Wall Breaker Pods and then return to the 
	starting area. Head down avoiding the chameleons and then 
	shoot the enemies on the barrier to get through.  You'll 
	see a second barrier beyond that and a Milestone, save
	and then use the Wall Breakers to break through the lower 
	barrier.   Head downwards, avoid the water drops when they 
	start falling and make your way through the rocks.  At the 
	bottom you will see another of the Chain Balls, you can use 
	it to get into two small areas at the bottom with Energy 
	Fields in them but it's not needed to complete the level.  
	Head left and follow the passage up/left until you reach a 
	passage that consists of a narrow space between two narrow 
	moving lines. Contact with them means damage, you have to 
	watch their motion and at the right instant go through to make
	it.  On the other side is another Milestone - use it 
	then head up.  You will see a structure that looks somewhat 
	like a strand of DNA, what you have to do is time your
	passage up to pass through the gap down the middle of it
	that opens as it moves without touching the sides.  Once
	you get to the top you can get an Energy Field Pod from the 
	left then head into the air current to the right.  Avoid 
	the rocks moving up and down, at the end head up.  Then
	head left against the weak current, then up.  The next 
	chamber has an Earth crystal and two chameleons with Wall
	Breakers below them - you don't have to go past them though, 
	there are more Wall Breakers on the roof of the cavern.  
	After you have collected some Wal Breakers continue left,  
	and let yourself be sucked down by the air current.  You 
	will see you are on top of the 'DNA strand', head right 
	again with the current but this time at the end go down 
	rather than up. Watch the motion of the 'plant' and dive 
	though the gap made when it moves, repeat with the two 
	plants below it and you'll find your self back by the 
	'string' cave entrance. Head down and to the right retracing 
	your path back towards Chain Ball. On the far side are two 
	'plants' that block your path, however their motion opens 
	a gap between then every swing, you have to dart through 
	that gap. Then use the wall breakers to destroy the barrier 
	behind them, continue right to exit the level.

15) To The Light 	
	As the name suggests we are almost through the ant nest.
	Head to the right, avoiding the moving rocks. When you
	get to a shoot able barrier, shoot through it and go into the
	chamber behind it to get some Wall Breakers and some Energy 
	Field Pods, exit the chamber and head up the passage where the 
	barrier was.  Head left past the Earth crystal and into
	the passage at the left avoiding the moving rocks. Continue
	up and back right following the passage till you get to
	a barrier, use the Wall Breakers to break through it.  Retrace 
	your steps to where you got the first lot of Wal Breakers 
	Pods and collect a new lot, return to where the barrier was and 
	continue up the passage and use the Wall Breakers to destroy
	the next barrier.  Continue along the path of the passage as 
	it loops about - (up and down near the roof).  When you get 
	to a fork in the passages, continue right along the top of 
	level. Head down at the end until you reach a barrier, 
	retrace your steps back up and take the first left - there
	are Wall Breaker Pods in there.  Use them to destroy the 
	barrier and continue down, shoot though the next barrier 
	then use the save point. Continue left and down to the Earth 
	crystal.  Continue on and get the ring. From here you 
	will see a series of barriers shut as you continue through 
	the passage and a group of enemies start to follow you as 
	you near those barriers.  Go through the passage slow until
	the enemies on the wall detach and go after you, then dart
	quickly past the barrier so it shuts and leaves the enemies
	on the other side.  It takes a bit of work to get the it
	just right but get through them all and you will be through
	the level.     
16) Infected Forest 	
	Just a side scrolling shooting level to make a break
	from all the puzzle solving.  Shoot your way to the end
	to exit the level.  Note the ruins at the end, you are
	getting close to the main hive of all the evil insects.

17) Old World Infection 
	You are now in the start of the ruins shooting your way to
	the end again. 	Watch the ruins grow larger and larger as
	you continue, almost there. 

18) Penetration 
	You've reached the hive entrance, at the start below you is 
	an Earth crystal and above is a Chain Ball. Firstly head 
	forwards slowly and eliminate the Giant Snakes.  You will then 
	see a barrier in the floor and just past that in the roof a 
	shoot able barrier holding back lots of bouncing spiky things.
	Don't shoot the shoot able barrier or you have just made
	life hard for yourself.  You will see a Spikey fly down and 
	through the barrier - just ignore him for now and return to 
	the start.  You have to use a weapon to push the Chain Ball 
	to the floor barrier and use it to blow it up.  That is easier 
	said than done. Fly to the top left corner and then slowly 
	push it down and along with the blue signle shot weapon,
	you need to be very careful or you will have to try a LOT
	to get it done. Once you get through, head down and destroy 
	the Giant Snake, quickly follow the enemy through the barrier 
	as it opens for him to exit the level.
19) Extraction 		
	Head right avoiding the bar that swings at you, head straight
	down until you reach the bottom and head right past the worm,
	get a ring and grab the Wall Breaker Pods then head back left. 
	You will find how you came in is now blocked, head up and take 
	the upper passage, head up then go right as soon as you can.  
	At the end destroy the barrier with the Wall Breakers and 
	continue down/right. Continue right for a chamber with ringss 
	and Energy Field Pods.  Head back left from there and take 
	the first up passage. Use the save point to the left and 
	continue up. Don't get sucked into the left current instead 
	head up and follow the odd looking Walker enemy.  Fire 
	everything you have into the Walker enemy while avoiding the 
	shots he fires at you every few seconds.  Once the legs blow off
	the 'disc' will fly at you, shoot it down (while avoiding 
	being hit) to reveal a Wall Breaker Pod so you can pass the barrier
	at the end of the passage.  Continue along the passage to 
	exit to the final level.
20) Remission
	The final level of the game and huge one as well. 		
	Head straight right as far as you can, then down at the 
	butterflies, left at the bottom and then up.  You will see
	a Walker enemy.  I find you need a slightly different
	technique than in Extraction to get through here though.
	Ignore the first one and hang back from it, you will see a 
	second one appear behind you in a few seconds. (You may
	find it useful to wait in the area the first appeared
	moving backwards and forwards to check on the first's 
	progress (It won't move off screen) Unleash all
	your fire into the second one - this will slow it down. (If
	you don't it catches up with the first and crushes you 
	between them)  Wait until the first explodes of it's own 
	free will while pushing the second back with your fire.
	Once it does quickly dart past the disc and shoot it down
	to get the Wall Breaker Pod needed to pass the barrier ahead.
	(Make good use of the health Pods released as walkers
	enemies are destroyed) The last bit with both of the 
	enemies very close may seem impossible but with a lot of 
	practice and getting good at predicting where the enemies
	will shoot will get you through.  Also once the first enemy
	blows up you gain access to the chamber ahead with many 
	rings - they can save your life!  Once you are through the
	barrier with the Wall Breakers, head down then right.  You 
	will see enemies on the walls waiting for you like in 'To 
	The Light' - once they start following rush past them fast 
	and keep going until they are off screen (they will stop 
	following you then)  You will be in a chamber with a Earth
	crystal, head up as far as you can.  Then straight left
	at the end go up and get the Wall Breaker Pods near the 
	roof and then use the save point to the right.  Retrace your 
	steps back left, down and right to near the second 
	caterpillar.  Go up the shaft and use the Wall Breakers to 
	pass the barrier to the right.  Go along the shaft, a ball 
	will fall from the ceiling and chase you. Dash as soon as 
	you pass it's place in the roof and you should out run it.  
	Continue along the passage to the right.  When you reach an 
	open area, head left and then down/left (The left/up area 
	has Energy Field Pods and a Milestone in it)  When you get 
	to the area with the Earth crystal head right along the 
	lower passage.  You end up in a chamber with a globe containing 
	a health Pod. I'm yet to figure out how to get it out of the 
	globe though so ignore it and get the Wall Breaker Pods from 
	beyond it.  Retrace your step back past the Earth crystal, 
	up/right until you get to the big chamber, then head down/right 
	and use the Wall Breakers to pass the barrier.  Continue left, 
	you will pass by two passages with Earth crystals, then a barrier 
	will close behind you. Head up and you will see the enemy you can't 
	attack again, follow it until you pass the barrier that 
	opens for it.  To the left is a Milestone and rings.
	Head up and then left, take the passage up. Then left and
	up again.   Up a bit further you will find a large chamber
	with another Milestone.  Go back to the right and continue
	up to the top then head left then up and left again.  At the
	far end you will find a group of Wall Breakers, get them and 
	return to the chamber with the Milestone. Save your game 
	then head up past the plant, you will have to outrun a ball 
	rolling behind you. Just dart (C) as fast as you can and you 
	should make it.   Continue left then up avoiding the arms 
	that swing at you.  Get the ring up the top to the right 
	and continue up.  To the right is three ring behind an 
	lot of bouncy spikes behind a shoot able barrier.  Continue up, 
	and use the Wall Breakers to pass the barrier.  You will then
	have to make your way through a chamber with lots of spike
	arms swinging at you - I find just going fast often works 
	here. Once you are through no shooting! You will enter an 
	area with hundreds of spiked balls above you held back by
	a shoot able barrier - you don't want to unleash them!  You
	then face a few enemies then another spike trap so be 
	careful shooting.  After that you head up a shaft with a 
	falling rock. At the top you go right and after a few more
	enemies is a Milestone. Continue up after saving get
	your favourite weapon from the Earth crystal beyond it and
	prepare to fight the final boss!

	The final boss chamber has several small areas off from
	it with lots of shields - they are essential to get through
	the different boss forms alive (get one EVERY time you
	lose a shield.)  The forms are;
	1) A wall of 'guns' that fire horizontally only, just take 
	out one gun and stay in the gap created to easily pick off 
	the rest of the guns. Once they are all gone the wall behind
	them will blow up and you can fight stage two.
	2) You will first have to fight your way past a few bees.
	You will then see a wall of guns like before except there
	are only three 'guns' and they fire shots that break into
	a lot of small ones a short distance after firing (kind of
	like one of your weapons except that you can shoot those
	shots down.), I find that if you hug the bottom or top
	and fly below the lowest/highest gun there is an area you can 
	sit and have all the shots miss you  bar a few you can shoot
	down.  Use that to shoot down one gun and from there head
	up/down depending on if you started at the top or bottom
	and kill all the guns to get to stage three.
	3) This looks like a ball with Humming birds attached by
	chains to it. You have to shoot them off one by one while 
	avoiding all the shots from them (of which there are a few
	types).  I find a simple up/down motion often works.  Once
	all the hummingbirds are gone shoot the central sphere to
	win the game.  Congratulations you've saved the world!

# 9) Finding a copy of Kolibri                          #
#########################################################

Since the Sega 32X and Kolibri are quite old now there is
no chance of finding them in shops.  That leaves two 
possible ways of playing it;

1) You can pick up a copy of Kolibri and a Sega Genesis/
Mega Drive and the 32x expansion module off ebay.com with
a bit of work - you most likely will have to buy the game
and the 32x separately and they sometimes are hard to
come across.  (I'm trying for a copy this way now but
thanks to many copies not having a manual or auctions
not being open to people outside the US I've not found
anything suitable so far)

2) The second way you can get to play Kolibri is with what 
is called an Emulator.  It's a program that simulates the
hardware of the 32x so 32x games can be played on a pc.
The emulator that I prefer to use is called Gens.  It can
be downloaded from http://gens.consolemul.com/  You should
note though that it requires a little technical knowledge 
like how to download and unzip a file to setup Gens though.
Also even though the emulation itself is legal.  Getting
a copy of the data from the game cartridge (called a ROM) 
downloaded from the net is of questionable legality -
on paper at least it may be legal if you own the actual 32x
cartridge but that's not been proven.  If you still want to
run Kolibri you need to obtain the 32x BIOS files for Gens
(You don't need to know too much about what they do, other
than they are needed and again like the ROM they are of
questionable legality.  Once you have Gens installed and 
configured with the BIOS files you can open a copy of the 
Kolibri ROM with it and play.  (A gamepad for your pc is
recommended)  I can't provide you with links to the ROM and
BIOS files though due to legal issues, if you want to obtain 
them various internet websites may have them, all you
can do is search for them.

# 10) Similarities with Ecco the Dolphin                #
#########################################################

Kolibri was made by Novotrade (Now called Appaloosa) who also
made the Ecco the Dolphin series of video games.  I've noticed
many things in Kolibri that either remind me of something in 
an Ecco game or are very similar themed. (Warning possible 
spoilers here if you've not played through the games) n.b. 
I'm talking about the Mega Drive/Genesis/Sega CD/Mega CD Ecco 
games here - not the Dreamcast/PS2 or any other versions of 
the games.

- Beautiful nature settings and natural creatures feature 
heavily in both Kolibri and Ecco. 

- The style of puzzles in Ecco and Kolibri that some love and
others hate are almost identical.

- Both Ecco and Kolibri feature similar soothing music styles 
(well I think at least - some people dislike both lots of music.) 
 
- In ecco there is a creature the Asterite that looks like
a strand of DNA, in one point in 'Ecco: The Tides of Time' you 
must swim through it's center without touching the sides.  In 
Kolibri their is a DNA like object you must pass exactly the
same way. 

- In both Ecco and Kolibri in some passages there are rows of 
rocks that from move side to side of the passage, that you
must dodge. 
 
- The first level in Ecco (The first game) and in Kolibri is 
just to show the opening story. There are lots of creatures
to look at but no real puzzles to solve or enemies to face,
just an action you have to do. That sets off the event that 
the storyline revolves about. 

- In the 'Dark Future' levels of 'Ecco: The Tides of Time'
there is an Amoeba like enemy.  A logo at the start of 
Kolibri features a very similar looking Amoeba which also
features as an enemy later in the game.   

- In both Ecco and Kolibri in the credits after you beat the
game you thanked for playing the game with almost the exact
same sentence.

The 'Pole Stabber' enemy in Kolibri appears in the Vortex Hive
levels of the Ecco: The Tides of Time BETA version (Not the final
retail.)

In both Ecco and Kolibri the earth/oceans are described as being 
selfaware/alive (in Ecco it's in the good future).

They both feature mysterious crystals.  In Kolibri the Earth/Evil
Crystal, in Ecco the Glyphs.

That's all I've noticed so far - if anybody has noticed any
other similarities please email me.
