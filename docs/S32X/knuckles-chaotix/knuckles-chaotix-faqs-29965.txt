4. Botanic Base

Botanic Base is a tree filled level. It is a beginning stage and as a result 
is fairly easy. The same applies for the boss.
The Boss begins by sending a metal claw down and abducting your Sidekick/
Player 2. This, naturally, is not good, as you are left suspended by the ring 
band. Naturally Dr.Eggman/Robotnik comes in to totment you. Now, hopefully 
you paid attention to training or read the instructions. Pressing the down 
button will stretch the ring and propel you upwards. You can control your 
direction at all times. The idea is that you come crashing down on Eggman's 
head. Of course what is a boss fight without a fight? Eggman will 
occasionally send an electric shock over his body. This will obviously hurt
you on contact. But he hardly uses it. Just make sure you aren't bounching 
all over the place during the attack. All that IQ and he can't even 
put up a good fight.

Of course, if you really struggle with the way above there is another way. It
can be easier or harder, depending on which character you use. Using Charmy Bee
on the boss means you can control the charcter more easily. Just use the dash
towards the boss (from any angle) to score a hit.

Recommended Characters: Charmy Bee


5. Speed Slider

Ooooh a ROCKET. So your heroes are now miles above the floating island. Ouch. 
Anyway some freaky ghostly carnival music will play (how many haunted carnivals
do we need?). Then some platforms start whizzing around, the wind pushed you 
to the right, a plug moves round a central pole and hell breaks loose. First
you have to figure out how to  beat the wind. Jumping can help you out of the 
right side. Be wary of the bottom of the platforms, as they can hurt you. Try 
to have lots of rings, because your partner will get hit lots and you will be
surprised at how easy you can die.

You now have a choice of four methods to repeat.

1: Stay on the right, jump on the plug, go back to the right.
2: Go to the left, stay still. Jump at the plug as you fly past.
3: Keep tapping the left button to stay in the plug's place and hit it.
4: Jump on a platform and jump onto the plug.

I don't recommend 3 because you will take a lot of damage. 4 is the best.
Note that again, Charmy's dash can help you, thoug not so much thanks to
those annoying platforms.

Good luck with this boss, it is a lot harder that Botanic Base, but there
is worse to come. After being defeated the plug disappears to reveal Eggman
on a jetpack. He flies off.

Recommended Characters: None


6.Amazing Arena
The fight starts with a hologram of Eggman. This hologram is real so move!
During the fight robots will make an entrance in the same way as Eggman.
Vector's air dash is useful for this fight. Just stand on the opposite side
of the arena, swapping sides when he swaps sides and hit him as you run to 
the other side. His punch can't reach you on the far side. After defeat of
this simple boss Eggman escapes again.

Recommended Characters: Vector the Crocodile

7.Techno Tower
Ok, you come up in a lift and you see Eggman in one of those mean battle
suits that ake you go "I want one". Anyway, this boss is a piece of cake.
This mean battle suit has one cool feature: swinging arms. As lame as it 
sounds and as slow as they move, he'll catch you off guard unless you
are on your toes. To beat him, you have to hit his red stomach compartment
which houses that ring all the bosses carry for some weird reason. If
you know the reason give me an email at sonicandfffan@gmail.com and you may
end up in the credits :) Anyway, you'll want a good jumper and speedy 
character so use Mighty or Espio. The other thing to beware of is the
two floating "lights". These shoot lasers which move so slow they are
easy to dodge. Easy ;)

Recommended Characters: Mighty the Armadillo, Espio the Chameleon

UPDATE: Samir sent me an email regarding the ring. Not only does it mean
this guy rocks, it also means someone actually read this FAQ, w00t. 
Thanks Samir :D

"I saw the ring the bosses of the game have. I think I know why the ring
is there. For some bosses, the ring may be the power source where you have
to hit Eggman to do some damage. If you beat the boss, the ring will stop
giving power, destroying the robot. I think that is the reason why Eggman's
boss robots have the ring. For a power source."

Sorry if I copied it wrong, but pasting doesn't work well in this font
so it was done by hand X(

 How could I forget, not all the rings in KC are normal. :S

8.Marina Madness
Almost there *phew*. This boss beating buisness is easy, no? Anyway,
this boss has cool music, so sit back and enjoy :D The prospect is
easy, Eggman has a nice crystal shell which hurts upon contact, but
being the genious he is, decides to open it to taunt you and expose
himself. Use this opening chance to get a free hit. He starts a 
bouncing expedition around the screen in hit crystal. Dodge him. He
is slow as always. Then comes the easy bit. After a second exposure
he bounces again, except his shield is now two small shields. Using
your rings as protection, hit him repeatedly. He shouldn't hurt you
that much anyway. Charmy can hurt this boss quite well surprisingly,
thanks to his flying. End of Boss. Now entering final stages.

Reccomended Characters: Anybody except Heavy and Bomb

9. Metal Sonic

Firstly, congratulations on finishing all the levels. Now down to business.
Metal Sonic likes to be a right pain. All the lazy bugger does is sit in
a slot under the level selector. Notice that the levels have turned into
the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. The remaining slot is an X. X marks the spot.
Hit X to destroy the numbers. Hit the numbers to start a trap. Here are
the traps and how to avoid them:

1: MOVE AWAY FROM THE SIDES. The sides will rise and squash you against the
   ceiling. Spikes will appear from the sides and two bumpers appear in the
   center of the arena. Jump, because the bumpers will push you into the 
   spikes. The bumpers will appear twice, so do relax after the first jump.
2: A giant snake-like thing appears. It has a spiky head so watch out. Simply
   run towards the snake and stand behind it on the far right. Repeat for the
   left side as well.
3: Stand on the far left. Rockets will fire from the background and hit the
   foreground. If a rocket appears behind where you are standing, MOVE.
4: Stand on the far left. Circular saws appear. You could jump them, but it
   is a lot easier to stand on the far left, out of range.

Hit the X four times to see the floor collapse and Robotnik + Metal Sonic get 
inside a BIG robot.

Recommended Characters: Anyone except Charmy Bee, Heavy or Bomb.


10. Metallix

Woowee. That is one mean robot. Woowee this is one mean fight. This boss has 
three stages, and believe me, they aren't too difficult.

Stage 1: Ok, the easiest stage. What you must do is run behind metallix
         and bash up his arm joint. Not too hard really.

Stage 2: Now he's in the background and has one arm left. If you remember
         the fight at the end of Sonic 3 with Sonic in death egg, it is
         similar to this. He throws his hand down, all you must do is avoid
         the hand and hit it. Simple. Just stay in the far right (he can't
         hit you there) and spindash to the left when his hand is and the 
         ground. This method is almost foolproof and why I don't recommend
         Charmy Bee, Heavy or Bomb.

Stage 3: Metallix now hovers to your left, above head hight and fires a beam.
         Problem? No. Despite that it is harder than the previous stages.
         Simply stay on the far right. When his beam stops to recharge shoot
         out to the left and jump and his stomach. Do this until he explodes.
         Congratulations, you just beat the game.

Recommended Characters: Anyone except Charmy Bee, Heavy or Bomb.
