CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION
***************************************************************************

  Warning: if you're actually looking for a MK2 FAQ, then skip this section
and move on. If you're interested in a lot of rambling about the history of
my "career" as a FAQ-writer, then read on.

  Until just recently, this FAQ was known as the Unofficial MK2 FAQ, not
the Forgotten FAQ. Known by whom, you ask? Why was it changed? Who really
cares?
  Although my FFI Walkthrough was the first FAQ that I had publicly
released, this was the first one I ever wrote. Why was it never released?
I was on AOL at the time I first wrote this FAQ, and back then they didn't
give the free FTP/WWW space they give now. There were, most likely, places
on the Web that might have hosted it, but I wasn't aware of any.
  So it never got released. I did, however, print copies out for friends.
And yes, lamers existed even back in those days. One day, someone whom I
had given a copy of this FAQ (who shall remain nameless) told me that they
had lost theirs, and asked if I would print them another copy. Being the
nice guy that I am, I printed this person another copy. I found out later
that this person had marked my name off it, wrote their name on it, and
gave it to someone else. It seems to happen to all FAQ writers sooner or
later, I guess...
  So why is it now the Forgotten FAQ? If you check the Version History
section, you'll see that the last update was in December 1995. Which means
it shared hard-disk space with a half-finished FF1 walkthrough that I
started, but never finished, that summer. And after that, I forgot about
this FAQ. By then I pretty much knew all the moves, and started playing
MK2 less and less anyway. In the Summer of '96 I finally finished that
FF1 Walkthrough, put it up on my newfound AOL FTP site, and this one just
sat on the hard disk.
  Until September 9, 1998. MK2 was released for the various consoles on
that day in 1994, and I've sorta started a tradition where I play it every
year on September 9. For some reason, when Ninth came around this year, I
finally remembered having written this FAQ.
  So why bother releasing it? Well, my FTP site is supposed to be where all
my FAQs are, and after all, this _is_ one of my FAQs.
  This FAQ was originally a Microsoft Word document for some reason, but
I've converted it into plain-text for this release. In reformatting, I've
tried to keep things as close to the original as possible, but I did have
to change a few things. I corrected a few unintentional grammar screw-ups,
but left in a few intentional ones. The original (two-line) introduction
got replaced by the long-rambling you see here. The Table of Contents
originally had page numbers, but that's because the pages originally were
numbered. 

  A few historical style notes:
  At the time I wrote this, the only FAQ of any sort that I had read or
seen was Hank Leukart's DOOM FAQ. I had borrowed quite a bit, stylewise,
from that FAQ; check out the Table of Contents, for example. Or the fact
that I pretty much copied his revision numbering system; the Version
History contains references to "minor" and "standard" revisions. And on
top of all that, the original introduction to version 1.0 was almost
identical to the DOOM FAQ intro. "Welcome to the Unofficial MK2 FAQ version
1.0. What does that mean? Well, unofficial means XYZ, MK2 means XYZ..." You
get the picture. Thankfully, that was soon replaced with the shorter
two-line intro that I've since eliminated.
  Also, you may or may not notice that this (and most of my FF1
Walkthrough) were written before I picked up my odd habit of favouring
British spellings.

  You'll also notice that I've written this FAQ to cover the Arcade, SNES,
Game Boy, Sega Genesis, and Sega Game Gear versions. I've only ever had
access to two of those (and only one now), so some of the things may be
wrong. If so, blame Game Players and EGM, since that's where I got most of
this in the first place.
  And if you find that this FAQ looks like it was written by a 14-year-old
AOLer, just remember that it _was_ written by a 14-year-old AOLer. :)

  Despite its origins, this FAQ was reformatted using the MS-DOS Edit. For
best results view with a monospaced font, 75 characters to a line, 8
characters to a tab.

CHAPTER 2 - THE MK2 STORYLINE
***************************************************************************
[2-1] After the Shaolin Tournament...

  Shang Tsung, after being defeated in the Shaolin Tournament at the hands
of Liu Kang, was facing execution at the hands of Shao Kahn, supreme ruler
of the Outworld, blah, blah, blah, he quickly came up with a plan of
revenge so evil that Shao Kahn was persuaded to give him one last chance.
His sorry hide saved, he lures his opponents into the outworld, where they
will face Shao Kahn himself...

[2-2] The Kombatants

Liu Kang
  After defeating Shang Tsung, he returned to his temples only to find them
in ruins, after his Shaolin brothers had lost a vicious battle with a group
of outworld mutants led by Baraka. Now, he travels to the outworld to seek
his revenge...

Kung Lao
  The last descendant of the great Kung Lao, who defeated Tsung so many
years ago, and then was destroyed by Goro, and a former Shaolin monk, Kung
Lao joins Liu Kang against Shang Tsung in the outworld contest.

Johnny Cage
  No one knows what happened to Johnny Cage after he disappeared from the
set of his latest film. Actually, he was following his former ally Liu Kang
into the outworld to defeat Shao Kahn... and get a script for a sequel to
his blockbuster Mortal Kombat.

Reptile
  Shang Tsung's personal protecter, and a member of a reptilian race
thought extinct millions of years ago. Hearing of Tsung's plans to enslave
what is left of his race, he turns against him in the tournament.

Sub-Zero
  When Sub-Zero failed to return from the first tournament, the Lin Kuei
sent another ninja, Sub-Zero's younger brother, to finish the job of
assassinating Shang Tsung.

Kitana
  An assassin for Shao Kahn, she has learned many things about her past.
Including, however, how Shao Kahn took control of the Outworld from her
parents...

Jax
  Major Jackson Briggs, leader of the US Special Forces unit of which Lt.
Sonya Blade was a member, has entered the outworld, where he belives both
Sonya and the criminal Kano are being held prisoner.

Mileena
  Thought to be Kitana's sister, she is actually a clone created by Shang
Tsung. At Shao Kahn's request, she is asked to watch for Kitana's suspected
dissension and put a stop to it, at any cost.

Baraka
  Leader of the outworld mutants that destroyed Liu Kang's temple, Baraka's
fighting skills attracted the attention of Shao Kahn, who recruited him
into his army of destruction.

Scorpion
  Hearing rumors of Sub-Zero's return, he again stalks the ninja into the
Outworld. After witnessing Sub-Zero spare his opponent, he realizes this is
not the same Sub-Zero that murdered him a few years ago.

Raiden
  After learning of Shao Kahn's intentions, the thunder god warns the
remaining members of the Shaolin Tournament about what's going on, and then
ventures into the outworld to take out Shao Kahn himself.

***************************************************************************
CHAPTER 3 - CODES AND SECRET CHARACTERS
***************************************************************************
[3-1] Introduction to Codes

  This section of the FAQ I am devoting to codes. Throughout this section
you will see after every code I mention a string of characters in
parentheses, like this: (ANnSs). This will tell you which systems the code
will work on. The letters stand for:
                        A = Arcade
                        N = Super Nintendo
                        n = Game Boy
                        S = Sega Genesis
                        s = Game Gear
                        ? = Unknown
                          = Not available on this system.
  For example, (AN S ) means a code will work on Arcade, Super Nintendo,
and Sega Genesis only.

[3-2] Codes

*  Random Select (AN S ):
  At the character select screen place the highlight box over the top
corner on your side (Liu Kang for player 1, Reptile for player 2). Then
hold Up and press Start.  Useful when you just can't decide with whom to
kick someone's butt.

*  Disable Throws (AN S ):
  At the character select screen hold Down and High Punch on both
controllers just after both players have chosen their characters.

*  Boss Intro ( N   ):
  When you turn on the game immediately hold down L and R. The normally
black Acclaim screen will be red, and Shao Kahn and Kintaro will put on a
skit for you.

*  Super Endurance ( N   ):
  At the red dragon logo screen hold L and R and push start. This will put
you into 2-player Super Endurance mode. Select four fighters by pushing
left and right to cycle through. Push down to change to the fighter
directly below the one you are currently choosing. Push Select for a random
select. Pushing any other button starts the match. To win a Super
Endurance, you must defeat all of your opponents fighters before they
dispatch all of yours. Also, this is still a best-of-three match.

*  Pong (A? ? ):
  Rumored not to exist in the home versions, one must fight 250 matches in
a row to get to play Pong. Now there seem to be idiots out there who think
Pong is a secret character. Actually, Pong is a very old video game with
two paddles and a ball. The object of the game is to get more balls past
your opponent than they get past you.

*  SNES codes ( N   ):
  Here is a list of codes that can be entered on the SNES character select
screen:

U = Up  D = Down  L = Left  R = Right  S = Select
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code:   |Effect   
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
UULUDS	|More time for Fatalites. Doing Sub-Zero's Freeze resets time
ULUURS	|Start at Jade
UDDRRS	|Start at Kintaro
LUDDRS	|Start at Noob Saibot
RUURLS	|Start at Shao Kahn
DURULS	|Super Power. One uppercut puts opponent in danger
LURDLS	|30 Kredits
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*  Cheat Mode (   S )
  On the Options menu, move the cursor to "Done", but don't select it.
Press Left, Down, Left, Right, Down, Right, Left, Left, Right, and Right.
Okay, it doesn't spell DULLARD (see section on MKI), but if entered
correctly a new option called "Test Modes" will show up on screen.

*  Fergalities (   S )
  On the cheat menu, select the option marked "Oooh, Nasty!" and select
Raiden as your character. In the Armory background push Back, Back, Back,
Block for a fatality and you will do a... fergality?

[3-3] Secret Characters

  In this section I will tell how to reach the secret characters. The
(ANnSs) is still in effect.

[3-3-1]   Smoke (ANnSs)

  To reach Smoke, you must be fighting in the Portal stage. When Dan Forden
(the guy whose face pops up sometimes when someone does an uppercut and
yells, "Toasty!") does his thing on the Portal stage quickly push Down and
Start. On the Arcade and Super Nintendo versions you will be sent to Goro's
Lair to fight Smoke. On all other systems you will still fight Smoke, but
not in Goro's Lair. 
  [NOTE: In the handheld versions, there is obviously no Portal stage. I'm
told in the Gameboy version that this must be done in the Pit II stage. I'd
assume that holds true for the Game Gear version as well, but don't quote
me on that.]
  Smoke is a another one of them fools wearing a Sub-Zero costume, only his
is gray. Throughout the match he will emit puffs of smoke (which is how he
got the name) which do absolutely nothing. He fights using Scorpion's
moves, although he's a lot faster (and smarter).

[3-3-2]   Jade (ANnSs)

  Another Kitana or Mileena wearing green, Jade fights with Kitana's powers
and is much faster. Also, projectile attacks go right through her.
  On the fight right below the "?" on the Battle Plan, win any round using
only Low Kick. Well, you block too. Anyway, don't be a wiseguy and still
try to do a fatality that doesn't use Low Kick if you're trying to get to
Jade. If you do, you've just disqualified yourself.  If done correctly you
get to go to Goro's Lair (on Arcade and SNES).
  According to Gameboy MK2 expert Ninja Smoke, you can fight both Jade and
Smoke by doing the following: at the stage below the "?", which supposedly
is a Pit II match, trigger the battle with Smoke as described in the Smoke
section above. Then, only use your Kick button against Smoke in the winning
round to move on to Jade.

[3-3-3]   Noob Saibot (AN S ):

  Spell Noob Saibot backwards and you get "Tobias Boon" after Midway
programmers (or something) John Tobias and Ed Boon. Neat, huh?
  Win 50 matches in a row and prepare yourself to return to Goro's Lair.
  Noob is another ninja dressed completely in black. Therefore, he is often
described as a "shadow fighter." At any rate, he fights with Scorpion's
powers.

***************************************************************************
CHAPTER 4 - THE MOVES
***************************************************************************
[4-1]   Key

U = Up          D = Down        F = Foward      B = Back
HP = High Punch LP = Low Punch  HK = High Kick  LK = Low Kick
BL = Block                      * = Can be done in air
() = Used to tell how far away from victim you must be to do a move or
     fatality. Distances are as follows:
                (close) = Right up next to 'em
                (1)     = One step back
                (2)     = Just inside sweep range
                (3)     = About the distance you start a match away from
                          foe.
		(EOS)  =  End of screen. As far as you can get away from
                          opponent.
  If no range is given, (for example, most moves and Scorpion's Distant
Toasty) you can do move from anywhere on screen. The exceptions to this are
the Pit/Spike Fatalities, which must be done close.
  Moves that involve D, F; D, B; B, D, F; or F, D, B must be done in a
continuous motion.
  If you do any move or fatality that involves holding BL, make sure to
release BL before pushing any attack buttons or the move or Fatality will
not work.
  If you do any move or Fatality that involves holding an attack button,
make sure you release the button as soon as you are done with the motions
or guess what? No Fatality.
  The moves which will be listed will work on the Arcade and Super Nintendo
versions. Most of the moves will also work on Genesis. Moves on Game Gear
and Game Boy should also be close. Refer to [3-5] for the moves that are
different and how to perform them on these systems.
  Also note that each character has only one normal Fatality on the
handheld systems.

[4-2] Background Fatalities

[4-2-1]   Pit/Spike Fatalities

  On the Pit II and Kombat Tomb stages, do the move I will list as
"Pit/Spike Fatal" for a Fatality. On the Pit II your opponent will be
knocked over and fall right onto a rock face. Ouch. On the Kombat Tomb, you
will knock your foe into the spikes on the ceiling. For added fun, hold
down on both controllers immediately after you perform the Fatality and the
victim will slide of the spikes and hit the ground.
  Note that you can only do the Spike Fatality on the portable versions,
although the only two backgrounds are the Pit II and Kombat Tomb. I do not
know if you can slide someone off in the handhelds.

[4-2-2]   Deadpool Fatalities

  On the Deadpool stage, hold Down LP+LK and do a normal uppercut when it
says, "Finish Him!" If you continue to hold Down a weird sound will issue
from the skeleton.
  Obviously, you can't do a Deadpool Fatality on the ports because there is
no Deadpool on the handheld versions. Oh well.

[4-3] Babalities/Friendships

  To do a Babality or a Friendship, you must not use a punch button in the
winning round. When it says, "Finish Him!" do the move I will list as
Friendship or Babality.

[4-4] Finally, the Moves

Liu Kang:
Bicycle Kick:  Hold LK 5 seconds, release
Low Fireball: F, F, LP
High Fireball: F, F, HP (*)
Flying Kick:  F, F, HK
Dragon-Morph Fatal: D, F, B, B, HK (close)
Uppercut Fatal: Hold BL, rotate 360 degrees counterclockwise (1)

[4-5] Other Systems

[4-5-1] Sega Genesis

  The above moves work on Genesis except for:
Sub Zero - Slide:  B+HK+LK
Reptile - Slide: B+HK+LK
Baraka - Blade Spark:  D, B, LP

[4-5-2] Sega Game Gear

   To do the moves on Game Gear Substitute the following buttons:
		LP =  1
		HP = 1
		LK = 2
		HK = 2

This works except for the following moves:
Liu Kang - Low Fireball:  D, F, 1
Shang Tsung - Morphs: Hold button 2 for 2 seconds and move directional
	Jax: Down/Right
	Kitana: Down
	Liu Kang: Left
	Mileena: Up
	Reptile: Up/Left
	Scorpion: Down/Left
	Sub-Zero: Right

[4-5-3] Game Boy

  To do the moves on Game Boy, substitute the following buttons:
		LP = B
		HP = B
		LK = A
		HK = A

  I have been told that fatalities on the Game Boy version can be done at
any distance with the exception of Reptile's, which must be done from far
away. (Thanks to John "Ninja Smoke" Evans for this.)

[4-5-4] Retained Fatalities

  The two handheld versions of MKII retain only half the normal Fatalities.
Those that were kept are listed below:

Character				Retained Fatalities
********************************************************************
Liu Kang				Dragon-Morph Fatal
Reptile                                 Eat Head Fatal

Scorpion				Toasty Fatal

CHAPTER 5 - MK2 DAMAGE CHART
***************************************************************************
[5-1] Introduction to Damage Chart

  Welcome to the latest addition to the latest edtion of the MK2 FAQ.
Presenting (fanfare) the Damage Chart. This chart lists the amount of
damage, in percentages, done by each move.
  However, since I have rounded off the numbers, the chart is NOT exact.
For example: the chart lists Mileena's Sai throw as taking off 14% damage.
In theory, 7 hits would take of 98% damage and put her opponent in danger.
Actually, it takes a little over 14% damage, and so 7 hits with her Sai
will actually kill her opponent. Most of the damages listed work the other
way, however. What would according to the chart would kill an opponent
usually just puts them in danger.
  FYI, it takes 15 unblocked regular punches, or 54 blocked regular punches
to kill your opponent. Throws take off about 20%, and all special punches
(HP close) take off 14%. Johnny Cage's close kick takes off 12%.

CHAPTER 6 - GLITCHES, COMBOS, TRICKS AND OTHER MISC. ITEMS
***************************************************************************
  Welcome to the chapter on Glitches, Combos, Tricks, and other junk. The
Glitch items all work on SNES. I do not know whether or not these work on
other systems. Most should work on Genesis and Arcade, but I do not know
for sure. The Combos and Tricks should work on any system.

[6-1] Glitches

*  Revenge of the Dead
  If the last thing your opponent does before you lose is a throw, then you
can still get in a move after it says, "Finish Him!" For something really
neat, do a Deadpool Fatality if they throw you into a corner.

*  Backward Spear Slash
  As Scorpion, when it says, "Finish Him!", jump over your opponent and do
the Spear Slash Fatal as you jump. Make sure you push Foward as how you
will be facing when you land. When you land, you will do the Spear Slash to
your opponent's back.
  While we're on the subject of Scorpion's Fatalities, the Toasty Fatal and
Distant Toasty Fatal differ as follows: the normal Toasty can only be done
from a distance of (3); The Distant Toasty can be done anywhere on screen
(even very close, despite the name) and after your foe explodes you will
hear Dan Forden yell, "Toasty!"

[6-2] Combos
  Ok, this section is a little weak right now, but will improve as I learn
more.
  Here are some real simple basic combos that will work with any character.
First foot sweep, then uppercut, roundhouse, or start punching like crazy.
  A hard to completely pull off combo with Kitana is to get 'em in the fan
lift, then jump and give your opponent a fist in the gut. Then quickly do a
Fan Toss in mid-air. If you're quick you'll hit 'em. If you're quicker
still, pull a Square Wave Flight as quick as you land to hit them one last
time.
  As an alternative to the one above, foot sweep, do a quick Fan Lift,
Square Wave Flight, then Fan toss on the way down.
  Reptile: Fire off a forceball. If they get hit or jump over it, nail 'em
with two low punches. Then hit them with a high jump kick, then slide.
  Fighting as Johnny Cage? Four punches of any type followed by a Shadow
Kick is a good combo. Also, Foot sweep, then time a Shadow punch so that
you hit them as they try to get up.
  As Jax, start holding LK while you do Jump Kicks, Gotcha Punches, or
Sonic Waves. If anything connects, you can let go for a free Ground Pound.
Also, if they jump at you, you can Punch or Kick in mid-air and then pull
off a quick Back Crack.  Also, the overhead smash (HP close) will: 1) Cause
damage; 2) Stun your opponent so that you can pull off a Gotcha or a
Quadruple Slam.

 [6-3] Tricks and Other Miscellaneous Items

*  Mixed Fatalites
  As Sub-Zero, do the Freeze part of the Freeze-and-Shatter Fatal. Then do
an Ice Grenade, Babality, or a Deadpool for something really neat. Better
yet, at the Deadpool, Freeze, get close, and do the shatter move, except
immediately after you push HP, quickly hold D+LP+LK+BL. You will do a
Deadpool if done correctly, but the screen will go dark.
  As Shang Tsung, morph into Sub-Zero, do the Freeze part of the fatality,
and then either: 1) Do what's listed above for Sub-Zero, or 2) Keep
Freezing until you change back into Shang Tsung. Then morph into anyone and
do their Fatality. Scorpion's Distant Toasty is a good one to use, as is
Reptile's Torso Ripoff, if you're quick with the controller.
  
*  Cheap Tricks
  For an easy way to defeat Smoke, Noob Saibot, or a computer-controlled
Shang Tsung, pick Raiden, Baraka, Jax, or Reptile and do their projectile
attacks repeatedly. They will just jump right into it over and over again.
Tsung also seems to jump into Sub-Zero's Freezes a lot also. Unfortanuatly,
the Arcade fighters are a bit smarter. They will jump over it and toward
you.
  
*  Toasty?
  Interesting. Kung Lao's Spin counts as an uppercut if it connects, except
it does more damage!

*  Kintaro Tips
  With Jax, do a Gotcha on Kintaro. If you grab him, nail him with all five
Gotcha Punches. Then Kintaro will shoot a fireball. If you jump immediately
after the Gotcha Punches you can get a free Jump Kick. Fire off a Sonic
Wave right after you land for a possible seventh hit.
  With Kitana, do a Fan Lift anytime Kintaro is just walking toward you.
The idiot will walk right into it! A Jump Kick followed by a Fan Toss is
usually a good shot.
  Kintaro seems to shoot fireballs after a missed Fan Swipe with Baraka.
Jump quickly after an intentionally missed Swipe for a free jump kick.
  With Raiden, usually you can do a lightning throw and then a jump kick
and then a lightning throw and then a jump kick and then a... but not for a
whole round.
  If Kintaro blocks a Jump Kick by your Sub-Zero, Jump back twice and do a
Freeze. You will usually catch him in a punch or fireball.
  If Kintaro just jumps in place, get ready to do an uppercut. If you're
Jax, you get a free shot at his 7-hit combo.
  If all else fails, just duck.  If Kintaro Jumps, do a jump kick. If he
gets close, he will try a throw, uppercut, or just roar. If the last two
occur, you can get an uppercut in. However, trying to uppercut his uppercut
takes timing.

*  Shao Kahn Tips
  As Kitana, just do Fan Lifts. Shao Kahn will usually walk or rush into
it.
  As Baraka, just do Shredders. Shao Kahn will usually walk or rush into
it.
  As Jax, you can do just Low Kicks, but that is kind of cheap. Gotcha
Punches work well.
  As Johnny Cage, jump kick, Shadow Kick, jump back, jump kick, Shadow
Kick, jump back...
  As Mileena, just keep Telekicking.
  As Shang Tsung, Do fireballs to back him off, then morph and do
something listed above.
  As anybody, if he taunts, free move for you.

***************************************************************************
CHAPTER 7 - MORTAL KOMBAT I
***************************************************************************
[7-1] Introduction

  Okay, now I have added MKI to this FAQ. Why, you ask? Well, because it
makes my FAQ longer and adds information, therefore making it appear
cooler. And, in my local arcade, anyway, they have the MKI machine next to
the MKII machines, therefore I could, in theory, take this one FAQ and kick
some major... um, well, you know.

[7-2] Game Layout

  By now, everyone should know the MKI layout. First, you pick your fighter
(duh), then you must fight every other fighter in the tournament (double
duh). Then you have to fight yourself in the Mirror Match, and then fight
three Endurance matches, where you must defeat two kombatants in a row
without getting killed yourself. Then you get to fight Goro, and then (an
old) Shang Tsung. Duh.
  Also, every now and again, the "Test Your Might" rounds come up. In
these, you must try to break certain objects for bonus points.


[7-3] The Story

  For ages and ages, the Shaolin Tournament was a contest of honor, and of
glory. But that was before Shang Tsung, an Outworld demon who took not only
the lives of his opponents, but also their souls...
  For a very, very long time, Tsung kept the title of Grand Champion, until
a Shaolin Monk known as Kung Lao defeated him.
  Returning later, he brought along his half-human, half-dragon, pupil
Goro, who then took it upon himself to kick Kung Lao's butt.
  That was 500 years ago...

[7-4] The Kombatants

Johnny Cage
  John Carlton, better known to his fans as Johnny Cage, is a 29-year-old
actor from Venice, California. The martial-arts superstar has entered the
tournament just for the publicity it would create for him.

Kano
  Wanted in 35 countries, this 35-year-old criminal is a member of the
dangerous Black Dragon organization. He believes that Shang Tsung's palace
is made of gold, and has joined the tournament merely to loot it.

Raiden
  Raiden, the thunder god, is rumored to have recieved an invitation from
Shang Tsung personally to join the tournament. Taking on a human form to
compete, he despises Shang Tsung.

Liu Kang
  Also despising Tsung, this 24-year-old Shaolin Monk has joined in to
defeat Shang Tsung, and return the tournament back to its former glory.

Scorpion
  Scorpion has only one mission in this tournament... to destroy the member
of the Lin Kuei clan who murdered him two years before - the ninja known as
Sub-Zero.

Sub-Zero
  True name and origins unknown, Sub-Zero is a 32-year-old ninja hired by
one of Tsung's wealthy enemies for the destruction of Shang Tsung. A task
that is further complicated by the return of Scorpion...

Sonya Blade
  26-year-old Lieutenant Sonya Blade is a member of the U.S. Army Special
Forces, headed by Major Jackson Briggs.  Her team was right on the tail of
Kano, which lead them to Shang Tsung's island. Holding her comrades
hostage, Sonya is forced to fight for their freedom.

[7-5] Scoring

  On some systems, unlike MK2, you get a score in MKI. You get points for
kicking, punching, and killing your opponent.  You get points also for time
remaining at the end of the round, for strength remaining, winning a round
without getting hit, and for breaking the materials in the Test your Might
rounds.
  Scoring for normal moves and bonuses are as follows:

# - Double Flawless is when you win an entire match without getting hit.
Note that Flawless bonuses take the place of Strength Bonuses.

[7-6] The Moves

[7-6-1] Introduction to Moves

  Here are the moves for MKI. I written them for Arcade and SNES only. The
Genesis and Game Gear moves are similar. The Game Boy moves are severly
screwed up, however. I may include them in a later edition..

[7-7] Damage Chart

[7-7-1] Introduction to Damage Chart

  This damage chart is just like the one for MKII, except this one tells
how many points you get for executing the move. It suffers from the same
flaws as the MKII one did, however. See Chapter [4-1] for details.
  Note that you get no points for a blocked move.

[7-8] Secrets, Codes, Tricks, and Glitches

*  Blood Codes:
  On the Genesis, push A, B, A, C, A, B, B on the "Codes of Honor" screen.
On the Game Gear, push 2, 1, 2, Down, Up.
*  Cheat Mode
  On the Genesis, push Down, Up, Left, Left, A, Right, and Down at the game
select screen.
*  Secret Sounds
  On the Genesis version go to the Options screen and select Sound FX #17.
Push Right and A simultaneously and repeatedly until the sounds stop. Wait,
and then you can hear some sounds you couldn't select before. Now go to
Music #16 and repeat the Right and A pressing. Now you can hear a secret
song!
*  Goofy SNES Glitches
  I'll bet you thought Sub-Zero was the only one who could freeze! Not so!
Kano can have the same effect on Goro. Knock him down with a jump kick, and
then throw a Knife. If timed correctly, the knife will go through him, and
Goro will freeze!
  Speaking of Sub-Zero and Goro, if you freeze Goro with Sub-Zero, you can
foot-sweep him and not undo the freeze!
  Still speaking of Sub-Zero, try this: Win your first round any way you
wish, then on your second round use three uppercuts and two foot-sweeps.
Then freeze your enemy. You will hear Tsung yell "Finish Him!" Do the
finishing move, and then check out what happens.

*  Reptile
  Ah, yes, the hidden character. SNESer's have the easiest time getting to
him: At the pit, double flawless, fatality, and no blocking, and there you
are. On the arcade and Genesis versions, you will only get to him by doing
the above only when strange shadows cross the moon. Game Gear and Game Boy
players? Tough luck.

  Version 1.5 (10/18/94)
        - Standard revision. Added Boss Intro code, fixed some goofs in the
          first version (Jax's Sonic Wave is F, D, B, HK, not B, D, F, HK
          like I had.) Added Combo section. Added page numbers to both
          pages and Table of Contents. Slight changes in format.

  Version 2.5 (12/10/94)
        - Major revision. Added a few more codes, added Mortal Kombat One
          section, and cooler still... I have added Damage charts. And for
          added coolness, I have also added the Damage and Score charts for
          MKI as well. Cool, no es verdad? Also, I have added the MK2
          storyline. Excellent.

  Version 2.6 (3/29/95)
        - Pathetic revision. Fixed minor bloopers here and there.

  Version 2.7 (5/28/95)
        - Another crappy revision. Put all SNES Character Select screen
          codes on one table.

  Version 2.8 (12/30/95)
        - Useless revision. Minor change of fonts.

  Version 2.9 (9/12/98)
        - First public release of the MK2 Forgotten FAQ. Converted the FAQ
          into a text file from its original Microsoft Word format. Fixed a
          few things here and there, and rewrote the introduction.

  Version 3.0 (9/9/99)
        - Fifth Anniversary Edition! Only a few very minor errors were 
	  fixed, but I just couldn't resist having a 9/9/99 revision 
	  date. :) A few notes about the Gameboy version were added; thanks
	  to "Ninja Smoke" for those.
