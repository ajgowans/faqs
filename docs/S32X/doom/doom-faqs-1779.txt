0. INTRODUCTION
===============
o This document provides detailed information on the cheat codes or functions
  in Classic Doom and Doom II games across a variety of gaming platforms.

o Other computer-based editions of the PC/Macintosh Doom games exist, however
  their cheat codes are identical in most aspects to those of the PC/Mac games,
  and so are generally not addressed in this document.

o In this document, codes for each game are usually given in a quick-reference
  format, and are then followed by a more detailed explanation.  For the game
  console and handheld games, code information may be followed by a "Key" which
  provides added detail on the controls or buttons used for entering the codes.
  A list of game maps (a "Map level warp guide") is included for all Doom games
  that have a "Warp" cheat code available.

o Unless otherwise noted, this document refers only to Classic Doom/Doom II
  games that are running in single-player mode.  In general, most cheat codes
  for most Doom games will only work in single-player mode.

o "Command-line parameters" (special commands for PC Doom/Doom II games) are
  generally not included in this document.  An exception to this is a Doom 95
  "re-spawn items" parameter, detailed in section 4: PC Doom 95.  (Access
  http://classicdoom.com/doomparm.htm for more about command-line parameters.)

o This document is 79 characters wide, and is best viewed in a monospaced font.
  The master HTML version is located here: http://classicdoom.com/doomcode.htm
  The master text version is located here: http://classicdoom.com/doomcode.txt

1. DOOM/DOOM II CHEAT CODES: GENERAL
====================================
o Most Classic Doom games include codes which can be "toggled": Entering a code
  once to turn on a feature, once again to turn it off.

o Whenever a weapon is acquired, it remains in the player's inventory for the
  duration of the game, unless it is removed as a result of using certain cheat
  codes.  This remains true whether weapons are acquired by picking them up, or
  are acquired through the use of cheat codes.

o Keys are always removed from a player character upon exit of the current map
  level.  This remains true whether or not the keys were acquired through a
  cheat code, or whether or not the player used a Warp code to exit the map.

2. PC/MAC DOOM AND ULTIMATE DOOM
================================
o Cheat codes (typed during a game in progress or during a paused game):

  idbeholda: Gain Computer Area Map item (active until next map level)
  idbeholdi: Gain Blur Artifact (can be toggled on/off)
  idbeholdl: Gain light-amplification visor (can be toggled on/off)
  idbeholdr: Gain radiation suit (can be toggled on/off)
  idbeholds: Gain Berserk Pack (can be toggled on/off)
  idbeholdv: Gain Invulnerability Artifact (can be toggled on/off)
  idchoppers: Gain chain saw (cannot be toggled off)
  idclev##: Warp to map ## (first # is Episode number, second # is map 1 to 9)
  iddqd: Toggle "invincibility" on/off (when toggled on, health is set to 100%)
  iddt: Type 3 times in Automap mode to 1) Reveal map, 2) Add Objects, 3) Reset
  Alt-tiddt: Like iddt but Objects include opponents (game versions before 1.9)
  idfa: Gain all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor (game versions 1.4 and above)
  idkfa: Gain 3 keys, all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor
  idmus##: Use music track ## (## is a number from 11 to 45; full version 1.9)
  idmypos: Flash a message giving player's angle and coordinates in hexadecimal
  idspispopd: Toggle player's ability to walk through walls on/off
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: The above codes are for use with a standard "QWERTY"-mapped keyboard.
  The idbeholda code cannot be toggled off.  A Computer Area Map item will
  remain in effect until the player leaves the current map level.
  The idchoppers code deactivates Invulnerability Artifact power-ups and codes.
  The idclev Warp code will reset a player's status to 100% health, 0% armor, a
  pistol and 50 bullets (all other weapons and ammo are removed, along with any
  backpack), cancels the effects of any other cheat codes which were previously
  invoked (with the exception of the map-related codes iddt and Alt-tiddt, and
  the Doom 95-only codes), and may cancel various command-line parameters.
  In original Doom/Ultimate Doom, Invincibility (iddqd) is disabled in the last
  room of the PHOBOS ANOMALY map (Invulnerability Artifacts are not disabled).
  If a demo is being recorded, typing the Invincibility code (iddqd) will end
  the game.  (When recording, Doom reserves the Q key as a Quick-exit key.)
  Map codes iddt and Alt-tiddt can only be invoked while viewing the Automap.
  During single-player games, typing iddt the first time reveals boundary lines
  (walls, doors, edges, etc.) on the Automap; typing iddt a second time adds
  indicators (green triangles) for all objects and monsters to the Automap;
  typing iddt a third time returns the Automap to normal.
  "Alt-tiddt" indicates holding the "Alt" key down while typing "tiddt".
  During multiplayer games, typing Alt-tiddt the first time reveals boundary
  lines (walls, doors, edges, etc.) on the Automap; typing Alt-tiddt a second
  time adds indicators (green triangles) for all objects, monsters and players
  to the Automap; typing Alt-tiddt a third time returns the Automap to normal.
  Alt-tiddt will engage Talk mode during multiplayer games.  (Pressing Enter
  after typing Alt-tiddt will exit Talk mode without sending a message.)
  The iddt and Alt-tiddt codes will remain in effect unless/until the codes are
  toggled again by the player.  Enhancements to the Automap function can remain
  in effect while the player moves or warps from one map level to another.
  The "add ammo" codes (idfa and idkfa) will provide all weapons to the player,
  and will set ammo levels to the player's current carrying capacity (initial
  ammo-carrying capacity doubles with the player's first backpack).
  In shareware games, the add-ammo codes do not add a plasma rifle or BFG 9000.
  The idmypos code is ineffective if Messages (toggled with F8 key) are Off.
  The idspispopd code disables a player's ability to teleport or pick up items.
  All cheat codes except idclev, iddt and Alt-tiddt are disabled in games
  played on Nightmare skill.  (In Doom versions 1.4 and above, adding the
  "-fast", "-respawn" and "-skill 4" command-line parameters will allow cheat
  codes in a game which simulates some key aspects of Nightmare skill.)
  In game versions prior to 1.9, all cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch and
  Cooperative games, with the exception of the Alt-tiddt code.  In game version
  1.9, all cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch games, but Alt-tiddt will
  still work in Cooperative games.
  Codes that include numbers may cause the player character to switch weapons.
  In Macintosh Doom games, typing a cheat code may fire the currently-held
  weapon, as all cheat codes include the D key, which is the default Fire key.
  (In Macintosh games, Fire may be assigned to another letter/key if desired.)

3. PC/MAC DOOM II AND FINAL DOOM
================================
o All cheat codes for Doom II (Doom 2: Hell on Earth) will also work with Final
  Doom and other Doom II-based software packages.

o Cheat codes (typed during a game in progress or during a paused game):

  idbeholda: Gain Computer Area Map item (active until next map level)
  idbeholdi: Gain Blur Artifact (can be toggled on/off)

  idclip: Toggle player's ability to walk through walls on/off
  iddqd: Toggle "invincibility" on/off (when toggled on, health is set to 100%)
  iddt: Type 3 times in Automap mode to 1) Reveal map, 2) Add Objects, 3) Reset
  Alt-tiddt: Like iddt but Objects include opponents (game versions before 1.9)

  idmus##: Use music track ## (## is a two-digit number from 01 to 35)
  idmypos: Flash a message giving player's angle and coordinates in hexadecimal
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: The above codes are for use with a standard "QWERTY"-mapped keyboard.
  The idbeholda code cannot be toggled off.  A Computer Area Map item will
  remain in effect until the player leaves the current map level.
  The idchoppers code deactivates Invulnerability Artifact power-ups and codes.
  The idclev Warp code will reset a player's status to 100% health, 0% armor, a
  pistol and 50 bullets (all other weapons and ammo are removed, along with any
  backpack), cancels the effects of any other cheat codes which were previously
  invoked (with the exception of the map-related codes iddt and Alt-tiddt, and
  the Doom 95-only codes), and may cancel various command-line parameters.
  The idclip code disables a player's ability to teleport or pick up items.
  In "Doom 2: Hell on Earth" and in "Final Doom", invincibility/invulnerability
  in any form will fail to protect a player on map level 30 if a monster spawns
  (materializes) or teleports into the player's coordinates.
  If a demo is being recorded, typing the Invincibility code (iddqd) will end
  the game.  (When recording, Doom II reserves the Q key as a Quick-exit key.)
  Map codes iddt and Alt-tiddt can only be invoked while viewing the Automap.
  During single-player games, typing iddt the first time reveals boundary lines
  (walls, doors, edges, etc.) on the Automap; typing iddt a second time adds
  indicators (green triangles) for all objects and monsters to the Automap;
  typing iddt a third time returns the Automap to normal.
  "Alt-tiddt" indicates holding the "Alt" key down while typing "tiddt".
  During multiplayer games, typing Alt-tiddt the first time reveals boundary
  lines (walls, doors, edges, etc.) on the Automap; typing Alt-tiddt a second
  time adds indicators (green triangles) for all objects, monsters and players
  to the Automap; typing Alt-tiddt a third time returns the Automap to normal.
  Alt-tiddt will engage Talk mode during multiplayer games.  (Pressing Enter
  after typing Alt-tiddt will exit Talk mode without sending a message.)
  The iddt and Alt-tiddt codes will remain in effect unless/until the codes are
  toggled again by the player.  Enhancements to the Automap function can remain
  in effect while the player moves or warps from one map level to another.
  The "add ammo" codes (idfa and idkfa) will provide all weapons to the player,
  and will set ammo levels to the player's current carrying capacity (initial
  ammo-carrying capacity doubles with the player's first backpack).
  The idmypos code is ineffective if Messages (toggled with F8 key) are Off.
  All cheat codes except idclev, iddt and Alt-tiddt are disabled in games
  played on Nightmare skill.  (Adding the "-fast", "-respawn" and "-skill 4"
  command-line parameters will allow cheat codes in a game which simulates some
  key aspects of Nightmare skill.)
  In game versions prior to 1.9, all cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch and
  Cooperative games, with the exception of the Alt-tiddt code.  In game version
  1.9, all cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch games, but Alt-tiddt will
  still work in Cooperative games.
  Codes that include numbers may cause the player character to switch weapons.
  In Macintosh Doom II games, typing a cheat code may fire the currently-held
  weapon, as all cheat codes include the D key, which is the default Fire key.
  (In Macintosh games, Fire may be assigned to another letter/key if desired.)

  Notes: In PC Doom II: Hell on Earth, map 11 is referred to as "CIRCLE OF
  DEATH" in the tally screens, and "'O' OF DESTRUCTION!" in the Automap.

4. PC DOOM 95
=============
o Doom 95 is a PC software package that allows classic Doom and Doom II-based
  games to be configured and executed in a Windows 95-compatible environment.
  The cheat codes (and command-line parameters) covered in this section are
  only those that are built into the Doom 95 software.  However, Doom 95 also
  accepts all normal Doom/Ultimate Doom codes when running Doom-based games,
  and all Doom II codes when running Doom II-based games (see section 2: PC/Mac
  Doom And Ultimate Doom, and section 3: PC/Mac Doom II And Final Doom).

o Cheat codes (typed during a game in progress or during a paused game):

  Alt-F3: Toggle sound effects audio mix between "NORMAL" and "HIGH" resolution
  fhhall: Instantly destroy most (or all) monsters on the current map level
  fhshh: "Waiting" monsters cannot detect quiet player (can be toggled on/off)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: The above codes are for use with a standard "QWERTY"-mapped keyboard;
  Code lettering may need to be adjusted accordingly for use with alternate
  keyboards (for example: fhhall becomes fhhqll on an "AZERTY"-mapped
  keyboard).
  "Alt-F3" indicates holding the "Alt" key down and tapping the "F3" key once.
  The "Sound Mix" code (Alt-F3) allows "high resolution" mixing of the game's
  sound effects (music audio is not affected).  "HIGH" mode boosts sound-sample
  frequency and bits per sample, quadrupling the data being sent to the sound
  board through DirectSound.
  The "Mass Kill" code (fhhall) instantly destroys all monsters on the current
  map level, except for Lost Souls and the "Baphomet"/Boss entity found in some
  Doom II-based games.  (Note that "stand-alone" Lost Souls will survive this
  code, as will Lost Souls which are produced when Pain Elemental monsters are
  destroyed.)  Each monster which is vulnerable to this code receives 10,000
  "damage points", which not only kills monsters, but causes Imps and humanoid
  monsters to explode.
  After using the Mass-Kill code, a player will be credited with "KILLS 100%"
  (minimum) when leaving the map level through an Exit.
  While the "Quiet Mode" code (fhshh) is active, any monster in Wait mode (or
  "asleep") can only activate if: 1) the monster hears the player use any
  weapon, or 2) the monster is damaged by another monster's attack, or 3) the
  code is toggled off and the monster sees (or otherwise detects) the player.
  While Quiet Mode is active, the use of any player weapon (including the fist)
  can alert all monsters within sound-propagation range.  If a weapon's sound
  cannot reach a given monster, the monster will not be alerted.
  Note that Exiting or warping from a map level, or starting a new game from a
  game already in progress, does not disable Quiet Mode.
  Quiet-Mode status is not preserved in save-game files.  If Quiet Mode is
  active when a game is saved, it will be inactive if the game is restored in
  an environment where Quiet Mode is currently off.
  The Mass-Kill code is disabled on games played on Nightmare skill.  The
  Quiet-Mode code cannot be toggled on/off during games played on Nightmare
  skill; However if a player starts a game on a lower skill level, switches on
  Quiet Mode, and then begins a new Nightmare-skill game, Quiet Mode will
  remain in effect.
  The Mass-Kill and Quiet-Mode cheat codes are disabled in Cooperative and
  Deathmatch games.

o Doom 95 command-line parameters (typed in "DOS" mode after the filename):

  -weirdo #: Re-spawn items after # seconds (# is a number from 0 to 61356675)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: Command-line parameters must be entered prior to starting Doom 95.  To
  include a command-line parameter in a Doom 95 game, switch to "MS-DOS" mode
  from within Windows, then switch to the Doom95 directory, and type "doom95"
  followed by the chosen command-line parameters (example: doom95 -weirdo 30).
  The "-weirdo #" command-line parameter will allow power-ups (weapons, ammo,
  keys, and most Artifacts) to be regenerated at some point after being picked
  up by a player.  "#" represents a number of game-time seconds (approximated
  real-time seconds), up to a maximum of 61356675 (or 1.95 years in real-time
  seconds).  If "#" is 0, or is a number higher than 61356675, picked-up items
  reappear instantly.
  The following items are not regenerated by the "-weirdo" function: Blur
  Artifacts, Invulnerability Artifacts, ammo clips dropped by Zombiemen,
  shotguns dropped by Former Human Sergeants, and chainguns dropped by Heavy
  Weapon Dudes.
  The "-weirdo #" command-line parameter will function both in single-player
  games and multiplayer (Cooperative and Deathmatch) games.  Note that when
  using the "-weirdo #" command-line parameter in multiplayer games, all
  players must enter the command, and the "#" values must all be identical.

5. SONY PLAYSTATION 1 DOOM GAMES
================================
o All cheat codes for PS1 Doom also work with PS1 Final Doom.  The controller
  configuration "Key" in this section applies to both games.  "Map level warp
  guides" for both games are provided at the bottom of this section.

o Cheat codes (entered while the game is paused):

  D L2 S R1 R L1 L O: Toggle invincibility on/off (toggled on, health is 100%)
  L1 R2 L2 R1 R T X R: Toggle X-ray vision on/off
  R L R2 R1 T L1 O X: Access Map Level Warp menu (warp to any map below map 55)
  T T L2 R2 L2 R2 R1 O: Toggle object indicators in the Automap on/off
  T T L2 R2 L2 R2 R1 S: Toggle possession of Computer Area Map item on/off
  X T L1 U D R2 L L: Gain all required keys, all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: To use codes, pause the game, enter the desired code, then un-pause.
  "X-ray vision" renders certain surfaces translucent in the first-person view,
  but not all surfaces will be translucent at all times.  In general, surfaces
  rendered translucent are those which are located between the player and the
  most distant surface in the player's immediate field of view.
  When the Warp menu is called up, the Right and Left buttons can be used to
  scroll through the names of 54 accessible maps.  Once the desired map name is
  displayed, press any symbol button (T, S, O or X) to load the map, or press
  Pause again to cancel and remain on the current map level.
  In PS1 Doom games, invoking a Warp code will reset a player's status to 100%
  health, 0% armor, a pistol and 50 bullets (all other weapons and ammo are
  removed, along with any backpack), and cancels the effects of any other cheat
  codes which were previously invoked.  (Invoking a Warp code effectively
  restarts the game on the selected map, and at the current skill level.)
  The "add ammo" code (XTL1UDR2LL) will not add keys if they are not necessary.
  All cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch and Cooperative games.

7. NINTENDO 64 DOOM 64
======================
o During a game in progress, a player may press Start at any time to bring up
  the "Pause" menu.  Normally this menu lists only three items: OPTIONS, MAIN
  MENU and RESTART LEVEL.  In Doom 64, cheat options are accessible through a
  fourth menu item, "FEATURES", which is initially hidden and disabled.
  FEATURES is normally enabled when a player unlocks an exit on map level 32
  and leaves through it.  (Note that the locked exit is one of 2 exits on this
  map.  The other exit is always open, and does not enable the FEATURES item.)
  The FEATURES item can also be added manually by entering any valid password
  for map 1.  (Select OPTIONS from the Pause menu, select PASSWORD from the
  Options menu, and enter any map 1 password.)  Password B1RR 9BJ5 68X? ZVK?
  will start a normal new game at the "BRING IT ON!" (default) skill level.
  From this point onward the player may press Start at any time during a game
  in progress to bring up the Pause menu, which will now have FEATURES as an
  added choice.  Select FEATURES to bring up the Features (cheat options) menu.
  (To return directly to the Pause menu from the Features menu, press Start.)
  The Features menu will remain accessible until the game system is reset or
  powered down; Starting new games or entering new passwords will not disable
  the Features menu.

o Doom 64 Features menu (enabled via 3-key exit on map 32, or map 1 passwords):

  > WARP TO LEVEL   STAGING AREA
    INVULNERABLE    OFF
    HEALTH BOOST    -
    WEAPONS         -
    MAP EVERYTHING  OFF
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: ">" is a triangular "cursor" appearing to the left of the menu items.
  The Features menu is shown here with its initial values.

o Doom 64 cheat options (accessible from the Features menu):

  WARP TO LEVEL: Warp to new map (includes maps 1 to 27, and/or current map)
  INVULNERABLE: Toggle "invincibility" on/off (disabled on map level 32)
  HEALTH BOOST: Set health to 100% (cannot be toggled off)
  WEAPONS: Gain all weapons and full ammo (cannot be toggled off)
  MAP EVERYTHING: Toggle enhanced Automap (with object indicators) on/off
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: To select a cheat option, first move the selection cursor (with the
  joystick or left-hand directional pad) up or down to the desired item on the
  Features menu.
  Note that gameplay automatically resumes when a warp is executed.  To exit
  the Features menu without warping, press Start.
  The map name shown with the "Warp To Level" item may be changed with the
  joystick, or the Left and Right arrow buttons (on the controller's left-hand
  directional pad).  Select the desired map, and then press any C button to
  execute the warp.
  Note that a player may warp to (restart on) the current map, even if the
  current map is outside the usual warp range of maps 1 to 27.  (A player may
  only warp to maps 1 through 27, or warp to any current map to restart on it.)
  In Doom 64, invoking a Warp code will reset a player's status to 100% health,
  0% armor, a pistol and 50 bullets (all other weapons and ammo are removed,
  along with any backpack), and cancels the effects of any other cheat codes
  which were previously invoked.  (Invoking a Warp code effectively restarts
  the game on the selected map, and at the current skill level.)
  "Invulnerable" ("invincibility") may be toggled on or off with any C button.
  The "Invulnerable" option is disabled when playing on map level 32: HECTIC.
  "Health Boost" may be switched to "100%" by pressing any C button.  This menu
  item cannot be toggled off (back to "-" from "100%") in the Features menu.
  "Weapons" may be switched to "100%" by pressing any C button.  This menu item
  cannot be toggled off (back to "-" from "100%") in the Features menu.
  The "Weapons" option will provide all weapons to the player, and will set
  ammo levels to the player's current carrying capacity (initial ammo-carrying
  capacity doubles with the player's first backpack).
  "Map Everything" may be toggled on or off by pressing any C button.  This
  option provides an enhanced Automap, which reveals all parts of the current
  map level, with the possible exception of secret areas.  The enhanced Automap
  will include object indicators, which may be in one of 3 colors: green for
  the player character, red for live monsters, barrels, and slow projectiles,
  and blue for all other objects.

9. 3DO (PANASONIC AND OTHERS) DOOM
==================================
o Cheat codes (entered during a game in progress while viewing the Automap):

  A L A B A R A C A: Gain 3 keys, all weapons with 500 ammo each, 200% armor
  S E E A L L U A C: Toggle possession of Computer Area Map item on/off
  S E E R U B B L E: Toggle object indicators in the Automap on/off
  S U C C E D A L L: Unlock maps 1 to 23 (start new games on any map except 24)</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
  U R A B A D A S S: Toggle invincibility on/off (when toggled, health is 100%)
  U R S U R R E A L: Add 2 screen sizes to the slider bar in the Options menu
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: Cheat codes can only be entered while the Automap screen is displayed.
  To view the Automap during a game in progress, hold the Use button (button B
  by default, but can be reassigned) and tap the Play/Pause button.
  In the cheat codes above, an "S" is used to represent the left-side Shift
  button on the top edge of the controller, and an "E" is used to represent the
  right-side Shift button (see the controller diagrams, below).
  The "add ammo" code (ALABARACA) will always set (or reset) ammo levels to 500
  rounds per weapon, and will remove any backpack held by the player.  If a new
  backpack is acquired after invoking the code, ammo-carrying capacity doubles
  to 1,000 rounds per weapon.
  If the "Map All Things" cheat code (SEERUBBLE) is used, monster orientations
  are not indicated as they are in other versions that support this cheat code;
  All object indicators will point in the same direction.
  The "Unlock Maps" code (SUCCEDALL) allows the player to start future games on
  any map except map 24, "MILITARY BASE" (see the "3DO Doom map list", below).
  In 3DO Doom, entering cheat codes may fire any currently-held weapon, since
  some cheat codes may include the default firing button.  The Fire button may
  be re-assigned to another button if desired.

10. SUPER NINTENDO DOOM
=======================
o Notes: There are no cheat codes built into SNES Doom; However, a bug in the
  game allows a player to instantly acquire new weapons.  Specifically: After
  picking up a chain saw, a player can gain new weapons on a temporary basis by
  attempting to fire rounds from any empty weapon currently held.  When an
  empty weapon is triggered, it is replaced by another weapon, which in some
  instances may be a weapon which was not previously encountered by the player.
  Note that new weapons acquired by this method may not remain in the weapons
  inventory if the player switches from the new weapon to some other weapon.
  Because it is a bug and not a feature, this function is unreliable and may
  not always produce desired or repeatable results.

o Some cheat codes for SNES Doom are available for use with Galoob's Game Genie
  device for the Super Nintendo, sold separately.  SNES Doom Game Genie codes:

  BDEA-B053 + 62EA-B953: Start new games with 8,464% health
  CBD3-B17F: Alter first-person view to "infrared" or "heat-vision" mode
  D7CF-F953: Start Episode 2 or 3 on any skill level
  E3EA-B153: Start the game with 254 bullets
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: The "Increased Health" code will initially change some aspects of game
  play.  Specifically: As long as health remains at maximum (8,464%), the
  player will remain undetected by monsters (even while attacking them), but
  health bonuses of any type will be instantly fatal on contact.  These two
  side-effects are permanently cancelled if the player is hurt in any way.
  Note that the Increased-Health code is cancelled if a player character dies
  (or the current map level is otherwise restarted).  To reinstate the code,
  the player must select "NEW GAME" from the Doom main menu (while the Game
  Genie device remains on).
  Note that the status bar in SNES Doom cannot correctly display health values
  above 999%.
  Active codes are not toggled off by turning off the Game Genie device.

11. SEGA GENESIS 32X DOOM
=========================
o Cheat codes (entered with a 6-button controller while the game is paused):

  U+M+A+C: Gain 3 keys, all weapons with 500 ammo each, 200% armor
  U+M+X+Z: Toggle invincibility on/off
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: These codes can only be invoked by using a "6-button" controller; The
  "3-button" controllers (originally included with some Sega Genesis consoles)
  are missing required buttons.
  To use codes, pause the game, enter the desired code, then un-pause.
  The 4 buttons in either code (UMAC or UMXZ) must be depressed simultaneously
  in order for the code to be invoked.
  The "add ammo" code (UMAC) will always set (or reset) ammo levels to 500
  rounds per weapon, and will remove any backpack held by the player.  If a new
  backpack is acquired after invoking the code, ammo-carrying capacity doubles
  to 1,000 rounds per weapon.
  Note that the use of cheat codes in Sega 32X Doom may prevent access to maps
  16 and 17, and will prevent the game's full ending sequence from being shown.

o Key for default controller configuration:

  Controller | Face of    | Top edge of
  button     | controller | controller
  -----------|------------|------------
  A = A      |            |

  Z = Z      |            |

12. NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE DOOM
==================================
o The term "Game Boy Advance" ("GBA") in this document applies to Nintendo's
  original handheld Game Boy Advance, the newer Game Boy Advance SP, and any
  Nintendo devices capable of running Game Boy Advance games.

o Cheat codes (entered while the game is paused, and L and R buttons held):

  A A B A  A A A A: Invincibility on (cannot be toggled off)
  A A B A  B B B B: Invincibility off (cannot be toggled on)
  A B A A  B B A A: Warp 10 map levels (will not work on maps 15 through 24)
  A B A A  B B B A: Warp to next map level (will not work on map 24)
  A B B A  A A A A: Gain 3 keys, all weapons with 500 ammo each, 200% armor
  B A A A  A A A A: Gain Computer Area Map item (cannot be toggled off)
  B A B A  A A A A: Gain Berserk Pack (cannot be toggled off)
  B B A A  A A A A: Gain radiation suit (cannot be toggled off)
  B B B A  A A A A: Gain Invulnerability Artifact (cannot be toggled off)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: To use codes, pause the game, then hold down the L and R buttons (on
  the top edge of the GBA) while tapping the buttons for the desired code; then
  un-pause if necessary.  (Both of the Warp codes will automatically resume a
  paused game.)
  Once invoked, the "Invincibility On" code (AABAAAAA) cannot be toggled off,
  and will remain in effect until the "Invincibility Off" code is entered, or a
  new game is started, or the Game Boy Advance is powered off.
  Invincibility status is not preserved in saved games.  If invincibility mode
  is active when a game is saved, it will be inactive if the game is restored
  in an environment where invincibility mode is currently off.
  The "add ammo" code (ABBAAAAA) will always set (or reset) ammo levels to 500
  rounds per weapon, and will remove any backpack held by the player.  If a new
  backpack is acquired after invoking the code, ammo-carrying capacity doubles
  to 1,000 rounds per weapon.  (Note that GBA Doom cannot correctly display
  4-digit numbers in the status bar; the number "one thousand" will appear as
  "000" in the status bar.)
  The "Computer Area Map" and "Berserk Pack" codes cannot be toggled off.  Each
  item will remain in effect until the player leaves the current map level.
  The "radiation suit" code, and the "Invulnerability Artifact" code (BBBAAAAA)
  cannot be toggled off.  Each item will remain in effect for the item's normal
  duration, or until the player leaves the current map level.
  All cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch and Cooperative games.

  Although there are 32 map levels in GBA Doom, maps 25 through 32 are only
  accessible in Deathmatch games (where all cheat codes are disabled).
  Episode 1, "Knee Deep in the Dead" begins on map 1 (and includes map 24);
  Episode 2, "The Shores of Hell" begins on map 9; Episode 3, "Inferno" begins
  on map 17.

13. NINTENDO GAME BOY ADVANCE DOOM II
=====================================
o The term "Game Boy Advance" ("GBA") in this document applies to Nintendo's
  original handheld Game Boy Advance, the newer Game Boy Advance SP, and any
  Nintendo devices capable of running Game Boy Advance games.

o Cheat codes (entered while the game is paused, and L and R buttons held):

  A A B A  A A A A: Invincibility on (cannot be toggled off)
  A A B A  B B B B: Invincibility off (cannot be toggled on)
  A B B A  A A A A: Gain 3 keys, all weapons, backpack, full ammo, 200% armor

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: To use codes, pause the game, then hold down the L and R buttons (on
  the top edge of the GBA) while tapping the buttons for the desired code; then
  un-pause, or enter another code.  (Multiple codes may be entered sequentially
  while the game remains paused.)  Note that whenever a code is accepted by the
  game, an explosion sound will be played.
  Once invoked, the "Invincibility On" code (AABAAAAA) cannot be toggled off,
  and will remain in effect until the "Invincibility Off" code is entered, or a
  new game is started, or the Game Boy Advance is powered off.
  Invincibility status is preserved in saved games.
  The "Computer Area Map" and "Berserk Pack" codes cannot be toggled off.  Each
  item will remain in effect until the player leaves the current map level.
  The "radiation suit" code, and the "Invulnerability Artifact" code (BBBAAAAA)
  cannot be toggled off.  Each item will remain in effect for the item's normal
  duration, or until the player leaves the current map level.
  All cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch and Cooperative games.

14. TAPWAVE ZODIAC DOOM II
==========================
o The term "Zodiac" in this document applies to either of 2 similar handheld
  Tapwave devices: Zodiac 1 and Zodiac 2.

o In Zodiac Doom II, cheat codes are entered via the game's internal keyboard,
  which is accessible during gameplay while in first-person view, or while
  viewing one of the game's menus; It is not accessible while in Automap mode.
  To access the internal keyboard, simultaneously depress, then release, all 4
  Action buttons (the circular 4-button cluster on the right side of the face
  of the Zodiac), then depress the analog controller/joystick once.

o Because all 4 Action buttons must be pressed, a player may switch weapons,
  accidentally discharge a weapon, or even activate nearby switches while
  accessing (or attempting to access) the keyboard screen during gameplay.
  Also, accessing the internal keyboard from a menu screen may cause a menu
  selection to be chosen unintentionally.  (The joystick-press that is required
  to activate the keyboard can also be read simultaneously as a confirmation of
  a menu selection.)

o Layout of Zodiac Doom II internal keyboard:

   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
   Q  W  E  R  T  Y  U  I  O P/-
   A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  >
   Z  X  C  V  B  N M/+  SPACE
   EXIT
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: The screen size for the first-person view can be increased by tapping
  the "P/-" key, or decreased by tapping the "M/+" key.
  Entering a valid cheat code, or tapping the "EXIT" key, exits keyboard mode.

o Zodiac Doom II cheat codes (entered using the game's internal keyboard):

  IDCHOPPERS: Gain chain saw
  IDCLEV##: Warp to map ## (## are two digits of any map level, 01 to 32)
  IDCLIP (or IDSPISPOPD): Toggle player's ability to walk through walls on/off
  IDDQD: Toggle "invincibility" on/off (when toggled on, health is set to 100%)
  IDFA: Gain all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor
  IDKFA: Gain 3 keys, all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: Cheat codes are entered via the game's internal keyboard, which is
  accessible during gameplay while in first-person view, or while viewing one
  of the game's menus; It is not accessible while in Automap mode.
  To access the internal keyboard, simultaneously depress, then release, all 4
  Action buttons, then depress the analog controller/joystick once.
  The IDCHOPPERS code will deactivate a player's Invulnerability Artifact.
  The IDCLEV Warp code will reset a player's status to 100% health, 0% armor, a
  pistol and 50 bullets (all other weapons and ammo are removed, along with any
  backpack).  It also cancels the effects of any other cheat codes which were
  previously invoked.
  The IDCLIP and IDSPISPOPD codes disable a player's ability to teleport or
  pick up items.
  Note that invincibility/invulnerability in any form will fail to protect a
  player on map level 30 if a monster spawns (materializes) into the player's
  coordinates.
  The "add ammo" codes (IDFA and IDKFA) will provide all weapons to the player,
  and will set ammo levels to the player's current carrying capacity (initial
  ammo-carrying capacity doubles with the player's first backpack).

o Key for configuration of Zodiac controls:

15. MICROSOFT FIRST-XBOX DOOM GAMES
===================================
o This section covers only the Classic Doom/Ultimate Doom and Doom II games
  released for Microsoft's first Xbox game console (also referred to in this
  document as the "Old Xbox" or "Original Xbox").  The Classic Doom/Doom II
  games for Xbox 360 (Microsoft's second console type) have no built-in cheat
  codes, so are not addressed in this document.  The Classic Doom/Doom II games
  released for Xbox One (the third Xbox console type) in July 2019 are covered
  in section 17: Doom/Doom II 2019 (All Platforms).

o The Xbox game "Doom 3: Limited Collector's Edition" includes the bonus games
  Ultimate Doom: Thy Flesh Consumed, and Doom II: Hell on Earth.  The Xbox game
  "Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil" includes those same two classic games, and an
  additional Master Levels game (essentially an extra mapset for Xbox Doom II).

o All cheat codes for Xbox Ultimate Doom will also work with Xbox Doom II and
  Xbox Master Levels.  The controller configuration "Key" in this section
  applies to all three games.  "Map level warp guides" for each of the games
  are provided at the bottom of this section.

o Note that codes can be entered at almost any time after the Ultimate Doom/
  Doom II/Master Levels game is initialized and running.  Codes can be accepted
  while a game menu or tally screen is displayed, and can even be entered while
  a gameplay demo is running (which can cause the demo to go out of sync).

o Because all codes require the use of buttons which are assigned to common
  gameplay functions, a player may switch weapons, unintentionally choose a
  selection on a menu screen, activate nearby switches, etc., while entering
  codes during gameplay.  (Codes may also be invoked unintentionally during
  normal gameplay.)

o Cheat codes (entered during a game in progress while Left Trigger is held):

  A A A A: Toggle "invincibility" on/off (when toggled on, health is 100%)
  A A B B: Exit/end current map level (warp to next non-secret map in Episode)
  A B A B: Gain 3 keys, all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor
  B B A A: Gain chain saw (cannot be toggled off)
  B B B B: Gain all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor
  X X X X: Gain Invulnerability Artifact (can be toggled on/off)
  X X X Y: Gain Berserk Pack (can be toggled on/off)
  X X Y Y: Gain Blur Artifact (can be toggled on/off)
  X Y Y Y: Gain radiation suit (can be toggled on/off)
  Y Y Y X: Gain light-amplification visor (can be toggled on/off)
  Y Y Y Y: Gain Computer Area Map item (active until next map level)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: To use codes, hold down the Left Trigger (under the left side of the
  controller) while tapping the buttons for the desired code; then release the
  Left Trigger, or enter another code.  (Multiple codes may be entered
  sequentially while the Left Trigger is held.)  Note that whenever a code is
  accepted by the game, a Cyberdemon "alert" sound will be played.
  Invincibility (AAAA) is disabled in the last room of Ultimate Doom map PHOBOS
  ANOMALY, and the exit area of Master Levels map BLACK TOWER (Invulnerability
  Artifacts are not disabled).  In Xbox Doom II, invincibility/invulnerability
  in any form will fail to protect a player on the ICON OF SIN map if a monster
  spawns (materializes) into the player's coordinates.
  The Warp (or "exit level") code (AABB) will immediately exit/end the current
  map, exactly as if the player exited normally (or otherwise met the specific
  finishing criteria for the map).  Gameplay will then resume on the next
  non-secret map, if any, in the current Episode.  (Secret/bonus maps cannot be
  accessed by using this code.)
  Note that unless/until play resumes on a new map, re-entering a Warp code may
  simply exit/end the most recent map again.
  The "add ammo" codes (ABAB and BBBB) will provide all weapons to the player,
  and will set ammo levels to the player's current carrying capacity (initial
  ammo-carrying capacity doubles with the player's first backpack).
  The Computer Area Map code (YYYY) cannot be toggled off.  A Computer Area Map
  item will remain in effect until the player leaves the current map level.
  All cheat codes are disabled in Deathmatch and Cooperative games.

  to map 15.
  Note that map 18 exits to map 1.

16. APPLE IOS DOOM CLASSIC (2009)
=================================
o The Apple iOS Doom game covered in this section is the version originally
  released in October of 2009.  This Doom game was replaced in Apple's iTunes/
  App Store by another version, released in July of 2019.  For more information
  on that version, see section 17: Doom/Doom II 2019 (All Platforms).

o "iOS" is an operating system by Apple Incorporated for their mobile devices
  (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, etc.).  The 2009 "Doom Classic" game for Apple iOS
  (also called "Apple iOS Doom 2009" or "iOS Doom 2009" in this document) is a
  modified port of the 4-Episode PC game Ultimate Doom.

o In iOS Doom 2009, cheat codes are entered via the game's internal keyboard,
  which is accessible while the game App is running by simultaneously touching
  any 4 separate points on the device's touchscreen.

o Because several areas of the screen must be touched simultaneously, a player
  may accidentally discharge a weapon, or activate nearby switches or other
  interactive objects while accessing (or attempting to access) the keyboard
  during gameplay.  For best results, choose empty areas of the screen, and/or
  pause the game first by accessing the game's Automap.

o Layout of keyboard (letters mode) in iOS Doom 2009:

   Q   W   E   R   T   Y   U   I   O   P
     A   S   D   F   G   H   J   K   L
   /\    Z   X   C   V   B   N   M    <X
   .?123           space          return
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: Although letters displayed on the keyboard are capitalized, the input
  is lowercase by default.  "/\" represents a "shift" key (not used); "<X" is a
  backspace key; ".?123" is a key to change the keyboard to numbers/symbols.
  Tapping the "return" key exits keyboard mode and invokes the entered code(s).

o Layout of keyboard (numbers/symbols mode) in iOS Doom 2009:

   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   0
   -   /   :   ;   (   )   $   &   @   "
   #+=    .    ,     ?     !    '     <X
    ABC            space          return
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: "#+=" represents a key to bring up additional symbols (not used); "<X"
  is a backspace key; "ABC" is a key to change the keyboard back to letters.
  Tapping the "return" key exits keyboard mode and invokes the entered code(s).

o Apple iOS Doom 2009 cheat codes (entered via the game's internal keyboard):

  give: Gain all 6 keys (3 colors, 2 types), all weapons, full ammo, 200% armor
  god (or iddqd): Toggle invincibility on/off (when toggled on, health is 100%)
  idbeholda: Toggle possession of Computer Area Map item on/off
  idbeholdh: Set player's health to 200%
  idbeholdi: Toggle possession of Blur Artifact on/off
  idbeholdl: Toggle possession of light-amplification visor on/off
  idbeholdr: Toggle possession of radiation suit on/off
  idbeholds (or tntweap1): Toggle possession of Berserk Pack on/off
  idbeholdv: Toggle possession of Invulnerability Artifact on/off
  idchoppers: Gain chain saw (cannot be toggled off)
  idclev##: Warp to map ## (first # is Episode 1 to 4, second # is map 1 to 9)
  idclip (or idspispopd): Toggle player's ability to walk through walls on/off
  iddt: Type 3 times in Automap mode to 1) Reveal map, 2) Add Objects, 3) Reset
  idfa: Gain all weapons, backpack, full ammo, 200% armor
  idkfa: Gain all 6 keys, all weapons, backpack, full ammo, 200% armor
  idmus##: Use music track ## (## is a number from 11 to 45)
  idmypos: Flash a message giving player's coordinates and heading
  resetmaps: Delete all player statistics and achievements for all maps
  tntamo#: Toggle full/0 ammo of type # (# is 1=bullet/2=shell/3=rocket/4=cell)
  tntamob: Have/remove backpack
  tntem: Instantly destroy all monsters on the current map level
  tntfast: Toggle "fast" mode for monsters on/off
  tntka: Gain all 6 keys (3 colors, 2 types)
  tntkeyCT: Have/remove key CT (C is color b/y/r, T is type c/s for card/skull)
  tntweap#: Have/remove weapon # (# is 1 to 8; 1 toggles Berserk Pack power-up)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Notes: Cheat codes are entered via the game's internal keyboard, which is
  accessed by touching any 4 points on the device's screen simultaneously.
  Note that the game is paused while using the Automap, and most codes that are
  entered while the game is paused will only take effect once gameplay resumes.
  The "all keys" codes provide blue, yellow, and red card- and skull-type keys.
  The "add ammo" codes (give, idfa and idkfa) will provide all weapons to the
  player, and will set ammo levels to the player's current carrying capacity
  (initial ammo-carrying capacity doubles with the player's first backpack).
  The invincibility/invulnerability codes (god/iddqd and idbeholdv) can prevent
  a player from finishing the PHOBOS ANOMALY map.  These codes must be inactive
  in the map's last room in order for the level to end normally.
  Any time-based power-ups (such as Blur Artifacts) acquired via codes actually
  last until the player re-enters the code, or exits the current map level.
  The idchoppers code deactivates Invulnerability Artifact power-ups and codes.
  The idclev Warp code will reset a player's status to 100% health, 0% armor, a
  pistol and 50 bullets (all other weapons and ammo are removed, along with any
  backpack).  Most other cheat codes are also cancelled by Warping, except
  invincibility codes, walk-through-walls codes, and the iddt Automap codes.
  Map code iddt can only be invoked while viewing the Automap.
  Entering the iddt code the first time reveals boundary lines (walls, doors,
  edges, etc.) on the Automap; entering it a second time adds colored shapes to
  indicate objects and monsters; a third time returns the Automap to normal.
  An iddt code will remain in effect unless/until the code is toggled again by
  the player.  Enhancements to the Automap function can remain in effect while
  a player moves or warps from one map level to another.
  The idmypos code is ineffective if the game's "Text messages" setting is Off.
  The walk-through-walls codes idclip and idspispopd will disable the player's
  ability to teleport or pick up items.
  Both of the tntamo codes will also function if spelled "tntammo".
  The tntkey code must be followed by a 2-letter suffix, where the first letter
  is for the key's color (b=blue, y=yellow or r=red), and the second letter is
  for the type of key (c=card or s=skull).  For example, "tntkeyrc" will add a
  red keycard to the player's inventory (or remove it if it's already present).
  The tntweap code must be followed by a digit, where 1=Berserk Pack, 2=Pistol,
  3=Shotgun, 4=Chaingun, 5=Rocket launcher, 6=Plasma rifle, 7=BFG 9000, and
  8=Chain saw.  Codes tntweap1 and idbeholds are effectively interchangeable.
  Most codes will be accepted during multiplayer games, but most will cause the
  multiplayer mode to fail, requiring players to exit the game.

17. DOOM/DOOM II 2019 (ALL PLATFORMS)
=====================================
o This section addresses the "Doom" and "Doom II" games that were released by
  Bethesda Softworks on July 26, 2019 for multiple gaming platforms.  Note that
  cheat options/functions are generally the same between both games, and across
  platforms, including PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and other devices.

o Some versions of Doom/Doom II 2019 (such as those on Xbox One and PS4) have
  associated "Achievements" or "Trophies" that can be earned by players for
  accomplishing specific goals in the game.  Note that invoking any cheats in
  those versions will disable the ability to earn Achievements/Trophies during
  that play-through of the game.

  Notes: "PC DOOM GAMES" includes Doom 1, Ultimate Doom, and Doom II; "XBOX
  DOOM GAMES" refers only to the Classic Doom games on Old/Original Xbox; "iOS
  Doom 2009" refers to the 2009 Apple iOS Doom (Ultimate Doom) game, which was
  replaced in 2019 by an iOS edition of "Doom 2019"; "DOOM/DOOM 2 2019" refers
  to the (Ultimate) Doom and Doom II (plus Master Levels) games released July
  2019 on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Apple iOS and Android devices.
  The PS3, SNES and Xbox 360 games have no built-in cheats so are not included.
  In PS1 and Saturn Doom, the add-ammo code only adds keys if they can be used.
  In 3DO Doom, a player cannot warp to another map level during a game in
  progress; However, a cheat code is available that allows a player to start
  new games on any map except map 24.
  In PS1 and Saturn Doom games, maps 55 through 59 cannot be warped to from any
  map.  In Doom 64 a player may only warp to maps 1 through 27, or warp to the
  current map to restart on it.  In GBA Doom a player can only warp to the next
  map, or warp 10 maps beyond the current map.  In the Old-Xbox games, secret/
  bonus maps are not accessible via the Warp/exit-level code.

  Notes: "PC DOOM GAMES" includes Doom 1, Ultimate Doom, Doom II, and Doom 95;
  "XBOX DOOM GAMES" refers only to the Classic Doom games on Old/Original Xbox.
  (For more about games in this table, see the notes with the previous table.)
  The PS3, SNES and Xbox 360 games have no built-in cheats so are not included.
  In single-player PC, N64, Zodiac and Old-Xbox games, and in Doom/Doom II 2019
  games, some map areas or situations can defeat invincibility/invulnerability.
  In all games except Jaguar Doom, GBA Doom 1, and Old-Xbox games, invoking a
  Warp code will reset a player's status to 100% health, 0% armor, a pistol and
  50 bullets (all other weapons and ammo are removed, along with any backpack).
  In the PC games, warping cancels the effects of any previously invoked cheat
  codes, except Doom 95-only codes and the map-related codes iddt and Alt-iddt,
  and may also cancel various command-line parameters.  In Apple iOS Doom 2009,
  warping cancels the effects of previous codes, except invincibility codes,
  walk-through-walls codes, and the iddt Automap codes.  In the PS1, Saturn,
  N64 and Zodiac games, warping cancels all effects of any previous codes, and
  essentially restarts the game on the selected map, and at the current skill
  level.  In the Old-Xbox Doom games, no previous codes are cancelled by the
  Warp ("exit level") code, but the player will lose any power-ups and objects
  that would be removed when exiting/ending the level normally.
  In iOS Doom 2009, Automap object indicators are color-coded, where red/
  yellow/green triangles show score-affecting monsters/score-affecting items/
  other objects, and blue/yellow/red "plus" and "X" shapes indicate keys.
  In 3DO Doom, all object indicators always point in the same direction, and so
  do not always represent the actual direction that enemies are facing/turning.
  In the Zodiac and iOS 2009 Doom games, an internal "keyboard" must be
  accessed before codes are entered, and this may cause unintended actions
  (such as weapon use) by the player character during gameplay.
  Note that the use of cheat codes in Sega 32X Doom may prevent access to maps
  16 and 17, and can prevent the game's full ending sequence from being shown.
