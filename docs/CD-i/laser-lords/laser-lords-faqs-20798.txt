A. Introduction
===============

There are some confusing things in Laser Lords. In the following, there are 
things that I call "conveyer belts". When you go up or down one, you don't 
have to keep pressing the crosspad. They could also be considered ladders 
but there are some ladders in this game. However, if you have any questions 
about terminology in the game, please feel free to e-mail me. I would advise 
that young children shouldn't play this game due to various adult themes that 
are scattered throughout the game. Remember to save often and have fun playing 
the game.
