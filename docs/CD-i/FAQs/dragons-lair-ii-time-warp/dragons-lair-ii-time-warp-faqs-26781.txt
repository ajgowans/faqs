DRAGONS'S LAIR II--TIME WARP

This walkthrough will take you through the 20th anniversary DVD edition
which may be similiar to previous versions and even the arcade. It will
address timing and the treasures found throughout.

I will break the game down into its levels than subchapters


BASIC TIPS

For the most part, flashes of yellow indicate in which direction you
should move.  If your sword flashes in your hand, use it.  There are
a few parts where you need to move to pick it up, so be careful.  There
are also a few areas where the direction of the flashes is ambiguous or
nonexistant.  We'll deal with those as they come up. 

Some areas appear in reverse.  Whenever you need to make a move,
the scene should give you an idea of where to move.  Pay attention to
your surroundings while going through a scene and you will better be
abol.e to deal with these reversals.

played various scenes in reverse.  Also notation suchs as "R/L" means
move right for a treasure or/then left to continue.
