   SECTION C: INTRODUCTION   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

Zelda's Adventure (referred to as ZA in the rest of this document) is the
third of three Zelda games licensed but not produced by Nintendo for the
Philips and Mangavox CD-I systems, and is also perhaps one of the least known
Zelda games.  Most people have never heard of, much less played, this game.  In
order to understand why this is so, let's take a moment to look at the first
two Zelda games for CD-I systems.  Those games, released simultaneously early
in the CD-I systems' life, were called Zelda: Wand of Gamelon and Link: Faces
of Evil.  Both games used similar concepts and game engines, and are
side-scrollers somewhat reminiscent of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.

Most people who have played those two games also hate them very much.

That's why ZA is not very well known; because the CD-I was not the most
successful of game systems and the game's predecessors were not popular, ZA
itself was not publicized as well as most Zelda games.  The fact that the game
was not made by Nintendo didn't help much, either.  The game didn't have the
opportunity to flourish in the spotlight, and it's extremely difficult to
find anyone who has seen it, much less actually *played* it.

Unlike Wand of Gamelon and Faces of Evil, ZA is a top down view game in the
style of the original Legend of Zelda and A Link To The Past.  The game feels
much more like a traditional Zelda game than the other CD-I games, and features
a mix of 2-D sprites and live action, complete with voice acting and cutscenes.

There is another twist that sets ZA apart from all the other Zelda games
(except Wand of Gamelon): this time around, Princess Zelda has to rescue Link!
Here's the manual's introduction to the story:

"It is the Age of Darkness.
"The evil Gannon has captured the young hero Link.  Only Princess Zelda can
rescue him.  Her journey will be difficult, filled with many challenges and
mysteries.  Armed only with the advice of the wise court astronomer Gaspra, and
the guidance of shurmak, Zelda must set out on her journey deep into the
uncharted southeastern region of Hyrule known as Tolemac.  Before she begins,
Gaspra warns her that the only way to save Link is to collect the seven
celestial signs that Gannon has stolen and that she must overcome one final
obstacle: Gannon himself.
Once she succeeds, she gains the knowledge and strength to rescue Link and
brings the magical land of Hyrule into the Age of Lightness."


»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   SECTION D: NOTE ON TERMS AND NAMES   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

ZA contains very little text. Most dialogue in the game is represented only by
actual speech.  Unfortunately, some of that speech can be hard to understand.
As a result of this, some names in this walkthrough may be close to the actual
name, but incorrect.  If any ZA players out there believe they have a better
interpretation of any name, feel free to let me know about it.

Also, names are not provided for most items or enemies.  In these cases, I
have to make up names myself.  When appropriate, I will use traditional names
from the Zelda series (e.g., mobilin, leever), as many of the enemies appear
to be the traditional Zelda monsters, or at least based on the appearances of
those monsters.

At the beginning of each section of the walkthrough itself, I will list new
treasures, enemies, and weapons available in the areas I'll be going through.
Keep in mind, however, that any treasures or weapons from a previous section
that you did not already obtained can still be found.  Enemies from previous
sections can also return.  I'll also be using the words "up, down left, right"
and "north, south, west, east" interchangeably when describing the direction to
travel in.  If you get confused, remember that there's a North/South/West/East
compass on the Overworld and Underworld maps in the game.


TERMINOLOGY:

Throughout this document, the following terms are used. Definitions are
provided here for those not familiar with the Zelda series or ZA.

ZA: Zelda's Adventure.
Tolemac: The land in which ZA takes place.
Overworld: All parts of Tolemac that are not underground.
Underworld: All parts of Tolemac that *are* underground.
Shrines: Dungeons. These are part of the Underworld.
Gannon: Traditional final boss of the Zelda series. Gannon's name is often
spelled as "Ganon."  While I personally prefer the spelling with one "n," all
instances of his name in ZA use the original spelling from The Legend of Zelda,
which is "Gannon."



»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   SECTION E: CONTROLS AND MENU SCREENS   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

The design of my CD-I controller is very similar to that of a standard
three-button Sega Genesis controller.  There are many different designs and
versions of the CD-I system, so your controller may be different from mine.
Only the first two buttons and the standard directional pad (which looks like
a big +) are intended for use in ZA.  Button One is used to attack enemies,
use items, and make selections.  You can only attack after you have obtained a
weapon.  Button Two can be used to open and close the Inventory screen.  The
directional pad is used to move Zelda around the screen.  When Zelda touches
the right, left, top, or bottom edge of the screen, she moves to a new area,
much like Link does in The Legend of Zelda. The directional pad is also used
to pick up items by making Zelda walk on or near the item.

THE MAIN MENU:

|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
|                                           |
|     |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|        |
|     |   ZELDA                    |        |
|     |   EMPTY                    |        |
|     | o EMPTY                    |        |
|     |____________________________|        |
|    ________                    ~~~~~~~    |
|   |  PLAY  |                  / EXIT /    |
|    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                   ~~~~~~~     |
|    ________   ________   _____________    |
|   | CREATE | | DELETE | | HOW TO PLAY |   |
|    ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯   ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯    |
|___________________________________________|

The above is a fairly decent ASCII reproduction of the Main Menu. The ~'s in
this and later menu reproductions are intended to represent a scroll graphic,
as opposed to the rectangular buttons used for the other selections.  The "o"
in the above menu represent a light that indicates that line is selected.

You can have up to three games saved on the CD-I's memory at one time. Each
save is represented in the Main Menu by a name (e.g., Zelda in the above
example).  "EMPTY" appears if a slot does not have a save.  To start a new
game, click EMPTY, and then click CREATE.  You will be prompted to name the
game; you may click DONE to return to the Main Menu.  To play a game, select it
by clicking the name, and then the PLAY button.  Selecting a game and clicking
the DELETE button, and holding it down for three seconds will delete that game
and it's save.  Clicking the HOW TO PLAY button will offer some instructions
for the game.  If the EXIT scroll is clicked, the game credits will play, and
then you will exit ZA, returning you to the CD-I system's menu.

THE INVENTORY SCREEN:

|¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
|  ~~~~~~~     /¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\       ~~~~~~~    |
|  | MAP |     | (BOX C) |      / EXIT /    |

|      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯                            |
| |¯| |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯| |¯| |¯¯||

| |<| |        (BOX B)            | |>|     |
| |_| |___________________________| |_|     |
|___________________________________________|

The Inventory screen displays items Zelda has collected and has available for
use. "BOX A" contains graphics of treasures Zelda is able to use, while "BOX B"
contains graphics of weapons.  On each side of these boxes are arrow buttons
for use in scrolling through the lists.  The O-# symbol is a key, and the
smaller box below it shows the number of keys collected.  The larger box below
the key symbol shows the currently equipped treasure or weapon.

"BOX C" is a circle, divided into seven sections, that will hold the Celestial 
Signs when you acquire them.

The MAP scroll here functions differently depending on Zelda's current
location.  If Zelda is in the Overworld, then the map shows areas of the
Overworld that Zelda has already explored, with a white square representing
Zelda's current location.  When Zelda is in a shrine, the map shows portions of
the shrine Zelda has explored.  If Zelda finds an Underworld Map item in a
shrine, then the map will show all the rooms in that shrine.  Finding a Compass
in a shrine makes the shrine's treasure room appear as a blue square on the
map.

The EXIT scroll, when clicked, brings up a sub-menu with three choices: SAVE &
QUIT, QUIT WITHOUT SAVE, and RETURN TO GAME.  Those are fairly self-
explanatory. 

THE GAME SCREEN:

The game screen shows the areas Zelda is exploring at any given time.  Many
things will appear in this area: monsters, people, items, and Zelda herself.

In the upper right corner of the screen you'll see Zelda's Heart Meter.  Just
like in classic Zelda games, Zelda's life is represented by the Heart Meter,
which can be increased by finding Heart Containers.  Heart Containers can be
found by completing shrines, and four other Heart Containers are scattered
around Tolemac.  If Zelda is hurt by an enemy or an attack, she'll lose some
life from her Heart Meter!  Fortunately, defeating some enemies cause them to
drop Little Hearts, which can restore that life.  If Zelda's Heart Meter gets
completely empty, she'll die.  Dying in the Overworld will place Zelda at
Vision Henge, and dying in a shrine will place Zelda at the start of that
shrine.

In the upper left corner of the game screen, Zelda's current number of rupees
is shown.  This number will rise and decrease as Zelda picks up rupees dropped
by enemies, buys items, or uses magic.



»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   SECTION F: BATTLES   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

Most battles in the game involve minor enemies, and are just a matter of your
typical hack-and-slash action.  There are some exceptions, and this section
focuses on general strategies that will help you overcome your enemies.
Strategies for boss fights are included in the walkthrough section.  Any
strategies in this section apply to all instances of fights with a particular
type of enemy.

GENERAL STRATEGIES
-Use the layout of the land to your advantage.  If there are trees on the
screen, use them to keep the enemies way from you while you attack.  This works
really well on Mobilins early in the game. Rocks and other land formations can
be used in a similar way.

-On some screens, Zelda and her enemies can move under obstacles that block
your view, such as treetops.  Be careful in these cases, because some enemies
will use this to *their* advantage!  Keep Zelda away from these danger zones
as much as possible.

ENEMY SPECIFIC STRATEGIES
Peahats: Early in the game, Zelda's not strong enough to defeat the few groups
of Peahats you find without taking some serious damage.  The Peahats have a
long range attack that can change it's course, making it easy for them to hit
Zelda.  Avoid them when possible, as they aren't in vital areas.

Goriyas: While not as dangerous as Peahats, Goriyas also have a long range
attack: they throw boomerangs that can fly to the other end of the screen and
return.  The boomerangs are easier to avoid, but keep an eye on them while
fighting Goriyas.

Zolas: Zolas throw spiked balls in a straight line.  For the most part, you can
usually avoid their fire or easily kill them from an angle, but sometimes you
may need to brave a gauntlet of Zola-balls to proceed.  Watch the Zolas
carefully, and you'll see that they move their arms before throwing a ball.

»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   SECTION G: WALKTHROUGH   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

This walkthrough begins after one has just created a new game file and chosen
to play it at the main menu.  I'm including the game dialogue where possible
and useful, so that this document can serve as a script of sorts for ZA.

First, the Zelda's Adventure logo appears, with a lone tower in the background.
After the logo disappears, the view closes on the tower's only window, which is
near it's top.  The view then switches to the inside of that room at the top of
the tower.  Here, we see an elderly man sitting at a desk and looking through a
telescope that is pointed out the window. This is Gaspra.

GASPRA: There will be no more viewing tonight.

[Gaspra turns from the telescope, picks up a quill, and writes something we are
not shown.  Lightning flashes, and Gaspra puts the quill back in it's inkwell.
He picks up a nearby scroll and opens it. It reads:

 "Gannon, Lord of Darkness,
  has taken over Tolemac. He has
  stolen the treasured celestial
  signs & captured Link!
       Make haste!"
]

GASPRA: Ah! The scroll of Shurmak, bearer of sad news these many years
     ago.  And so it was that Gannon, Lord of Darkness, had taken over
     Tolemac.  He had stolen the treasured celestial signs and captured
     Link!  A brave warrior would have to be found to face this evil
     monster.

[Fade out. Fade in on a large crystal that is sitting on Gaspra's desk.  An
image of Zelda is in the crystal.  Gaspra passes his hand over the crystal, and
the screen fades out.  When the screen fades back in, Gaspra stands, with his
back to the camera, before Zelda. Zelda's head is bowed.  As Gaspra speaks to
Zelda, he places a pendant around her neck and then backs out of view.]

GASPRA: And so I found this champion of strength and courage.  It is
     you, Princess Zelda.  With this magic pendant, go forth and with
     each sign you gather, so too will you gain knowledge.  Find your
     magic wand.  Use it wisely and listen to your allies along the
     way. Go new my princess, restore the celestial signs and rescue
     Link!

[Fade out.]


OVERWORLD, PART I
Treasures: Candle, Magic Shield, Ladder
Weapons: Wand, Firestorm, Calm, Dagger 
Enemies: Goriyas, RockHeads, Peahats, Mobilins, Mobys, Deelers


When the screen fades back in, the game has switched to the overhead view style
of the first Zelda game, and the player has control of Zelda.  Zelda herself is
standing on a platform at the center of the screen. This screen is known as
Vision Henge, and if Zelda dies in the Overworld or you save and quit in the
Overworld, Zelda will be returned to this spot.

From here, go left one screen.  You'll see some sort of stone monument.  The
eight screens directly around Vision Henge contain several of these monuments,
and no enemies.  Remember that, so that you can easily retreat to this area,
which I'm dubbing Safe Haven, if you have problems fighting enemies early in
the game.  On this screen, you'll hear a voice:

SHURMAK: I am Shurmak, your guide.  I have known you since you were a
     child.  You were given a difficult challenge.  You will have to go
     far and overcome great danger.  Stay calm and use your knowledge
     and strength to defeat your enemies.  Remember what you learn
     along the way and persevere.  Go now to the one who has a bed, but
     never sleeps, where by his side, the red willow weeps and to it's
     mouth that never speaks.

This is your introduction to Shurmak, likely the same person who sent the
Scroll of Shurmak to Gaspra.  Shurmak's voice sounds female to me, so
henceforth Shurmak is a she.  She's obviously given you a riddle regarding your
first major destination. Make a note of it and keep your eyes open for a red
willow tree, but otherwise don't worry about the riddle right now.

Go right one screen, back to Vision Henge. Go up one screen and right one more
screen, then stop to listen again.

SHURMAK: Zelda!  Zelda!  Do not roam unprotected.  Look nearby for
     something to aid you.

That sounds like a good idea, but there's nothing on this screen. Go down one
screen instead, and you'll find something.  Zelda's magic wand is lying on the
stone at the left side of the screen.  Walk over to it to pick up the wand.
The wand is automatically equipped, so give it a few test swings.  Now that
you're armed, I suggest that you wander around the screens immediately
surrounding Safe Haven until you're a little comfortable with Zelda's attacking
range and movement abilities when under fire.  I'm going to continue the
walkthrough from this screen, however, so return here if you do decide to
wander a little.

Go right one screen.  Here we find three Goriyas.  As is typical of these
humanoid rat-like creatures, Goriyas are armed with boomerangs.  They can throw
these boomerangs the entire length of the screen, so be careful of their range.
Kill all three of these monsters, and then stop to look at the sign on the left
side of the screen.  It reads "Mobilin Inn," and is pointing to the northeast.
Hmm, sounds like a clue!  Go up one screen and kill the four RockHead enemies
you find here.  Look at your rupee indicator in the upper left of the screen.
Do you have at least 5 rupees?  If not, head left to kill more enemies and then
return to this screen.  If you do have 5 rupees, head right to find the inn
that sign was pointing toward.

When you enter this screen, a woman standing beside the inn speaks to you.

WOMAN: Oh fair princess, pity a suffering creature exiled from great
     Wimbich.  I ask only enough for a single meal for my children who
     hunger and are chilled by the wind.

Zelda's known for being a compassionate and caring princess, so let's give the
woman some rupees, even though we don't see any kids around. Go to the
Inventory screen, and select the rupee in the Treasures box to equip it.  Close
the screen, and then use the rupees.  The woman takes 5 rupees from you (food
must be cheap), and drops an item.

WOMAN: You will be blessed a thousand times a thousand fair princess.

Pick up the item to receive your first magic spell, Firestorm.  After you leave
the screen and return, the woman will be gone.  Go inside the inn through it's
door.  Here there are four people: the Innkeep behind the bar, a woman at the
left side of the table, a large man in a red shirt, and another man at the
right side of the table.  On the bar is an open book with a C on it.  The
Innkeep speaks as soon as you enter.

INNKEEP: Welcome to the Mobilin's Head Inn, my princess.  You look dry.
     Have a cup of Andor's cider on the house.

Approach the book on the bar to discover the first shop in the game.  When you
get close to the book, a yellow "100" will flash above it.  This is the price
of the item.  If you choose to buy it, equip rupees, go to the item so that the
price is flashing, and use the rupees.  You'll lose the amount of the price and
gain the item.  All shops in the game work in this manner.

INNKEEP: I have a spell of Calm to sell, but it will cost you one
     hundred rubies.

If you have 100 rupees (nevermind that the Innkeep says *rubies,* as he means
rupees), go ahead and buy the Calm.  Doing so gives you another magic spell.
If you don't have the money now, you can come back for Calm later.

Approach the man in the red shirt, and listen to what he says.  Move away from
him and approach him again.  He'll say something different and give you the
Dagger, another magic spell.  There's a lot of these early on, isn't there?

Approach the other man on the left side of the table.

MAN: I'm so exhausted from my travels.  If only I'd known to cross
     the chasm rift with a ladder, it would have saved me months.

That's something to remember.  Now go talk to the woman at the table.

WOMAN: You look like an honest maid.  Sit a moment.  It is said 'those
     who go deep into the earth learn to overcome the sins of greed.'
     That may be true, but I do know this: a candle and a silver key
     can bring you bliss.  Hurry on now, lass.  Time's a'wasting.

Another clue, eh?  Leave the inn, as you're done here unless you return to buy
Calm.  If you return, the man in the red shirt will be gone.

Now it's time to wander a little.  You can earn the rupees for the spell of
Calm if you like, or try out your new spells.  At any rate, return to Vision
Henge when you're ready to continue on with the walkthrough.

Head three screens south from Vision Henge to the Forest of Ogbam (conveniently
marked with a wooden sign).  You'll find several types of enemies in the
forest: Mobilins (dog faced soldiers), Mobys (birds), Little Deelers (spiders),
and Leevers.  None of them have any specials attacks, so just kill them.  From
the forest entrance, head left one screen.  Here is another shop, selling a
Candle for 100 rupees and a Magic Shield for 500 rupees.  Buy them if you
wish, but you don't need them just yet.  Head south for two screens.  On this
screen, you'll see a strange looking tree in the center area.  It looks strange
because there's a ladder leaning on the tree!  Pick up the ladder; after what
you heard at the Mobilin's Head Inn, the ladder is bound to be a useful item.

From here, head right two screens and down one.  At the bottom right of the
screen will be an old woman.  No matter what she says, do not go anywhere near
her!  If you do go to her, she simply tells you not to trust anyone, including
herself, and does one heart's worth of damage to Zelda.

After giving the old hag a wide berth, go left one screen and down three.  You
can't miss what's special about this screen; there's a giant red willow tree
here.  There are also two caves.  Recall Shurmak's riddle.  The "mouth that
never speaks" is a cave mouth, and the bed is likely bedrock.  For now, avoid
the lower cave.  Enter the upper cave, and you've found the first dungeon, the
Shrine of Earth.

In the first room of the Shrine of Earth, Shurmak will speak to you again.
Listen, and then continue to right for the next room and a new voice:

LORT: Do not come in here.  You're not wanted.  I am Lort, and this is
     my shrine, all mine!

Ignore Lort, and approach the rift in the ground near the center of the room.
Remember the man at the inn who spoke about using a ladder to cross a chasm
rift?  Equip the ladder and use it here.  Walk across the ladder, which is now
lying across the rift.  You can't retrieve the ladder, so proceed to the next
room, on the right.  Enemies start appearing now; there are two Red Tektites
here.  Kill them, and then proceed to the right again.  Kill two more Red
Tektites in this room, and you'll be awarded with the dungeon's Map.

From here, you have three choices.  You can go up, right, or down.  The right
path leads to three Vire and a dead end.  The north path is also a dead end,
so go down.  There's three Vire here, also; kill them, and the last one to die
will drop Compass 1.  Continue south, and kill two more Vire.  Go right, and
you'll find a Red Sheepman.  He'll talk, but that's just a distraction.  You 
can't do any damage to him yet, so hurry south before he hurts you.

Here you find your first treasure chest.  Apparently, even wooden boxes can
talk in Tolemac. O_o  The chest will drop the Jade Ring, a magic spell known
for working quite well against those that protect greedy beings.  Now is a
good time to recall everything you've heard about greed up to this point in
the game, as those things apply to this dungeon.  Pick the Jade Ring up,
equip it, and return to the previous room to kill that Sheepman, one of Lort's
protectors.  Now return to the room that had the treasure chest.  The chest is
now gone.  Just to the right of where the chest used to be is a door to
another room; it can be hard to see, but go through that door.

There are no enemies in this room, so go through the door on the upper right
to experience some really sloppy dungeon design.  In the last room, you were
near the bottom of the map, but now you've suddenly jumped up past two rooms
to the middle right branch of the map.  Weird but true, and it happens again
a few rooms later, too.  In this next room that you've just entered, there's
a lone Vire to kill.  Go right to find a Blue Sheepman, and again use the Jade
Ring to kill it.  Go back left, and then head up, left (there's that other map
jump), and up.  Kill the Vire here and head up again to kill some more 
Tektites.  Once they're dead, be sure to pick up the Red Boots; you'll need 
these later to cross a river.

Now go right again, and you'll notice right away that this room is very dark
and hard to see.  If you bought a Candle before entering the Shrine, you can
use it here to increase the light level in this room to normal.  However, since
there are no enemies here, I recommend that you save the Candle for later use
and just navigate the twisty tunnel of this room as best you can.  The exit is
on the upper left.

In the next room, you'll meet Lort himself.  He'll say a little something and
then disappear.  There's nothing else of interest here, so go right to find
another empty room.  Before proceeding, equip the Jade Ring again.  When you're
prepared, go right to find the last Sheepman in this dungeon; this time it's a
yellow one.  There's a barrier across the exit at the top of this room; stay
away from it, and focus on the Sheepman.  Killing him rids you of the barrier.
Take a moment to catch your breath and unequip the Jade Ring.  Then head up for
the first boss battle. One thing you should know before going ahead is that if
you die in the Boss Room, you'll continue from the entrance to this room.

BOSS BATTLE: LORT
Attacks: Double Axe Throw
Reward: 250 Rupees, First Celestial Sign

This fight might take a while, but if you get Lort's movement and attack
patterns down, it's really easy.  Lort's only attack is the ability to throw
two small axes.  The axes always move away from Lort in an inverted V pattern,
and he always faces the bottom of the screen, so they can be easy to avoid.
Lort will also move around himself, typically moving from side to site with an
occasional movement toward the center or top of the room.  He usually only
throws axes when he's on one side or the center of the room, so those are good
times to move away from his frontal area.  If Lort is near the top of the
room, be sure that you're not standing in front of him, as he almost always
throws axes up there.  When Lort moves to the center area of the screen and
starts moving from side to side, attack.

The small map of the room below shows the positions from which Lort usually
throws axes, represented by X.  The > in the map represents a rock outcropping
on the west wall.  When Lort is moving from side to side in the middle of the
room, there's a good place to stand just above and to the right of this
outcropping.  From there, you can hit Lort without fear of taking damage
yourself.

|----^----|
|X   X   X|
|         |
|>   X    |
|         |
|----^----|

To defeat Lort, simply hit him ten times with Zelda's Wand. It may take less
if you use some spells, but be sure not to use the Jade Ring - it does almost
no damage to Lort.



THE FIRST CELESTIAL SIGN
When Lort's dead, you'll automatically get 250 rupees.  Fans of the traditional
Zelda series will expect a heart container to appear on his death.  It won't,
so move through the door to the north that is now open.  In this room, filled
with gems, you'll find the first Celestial Sign sitting on a table.  Approach
it, and a cutscene will begin.

[Closeup of the Celestial Sign, sitting on the table.  It has the same design
that can be seen on the face of the Compass and Map of the Shrine, and one of
the monuments around Vision Henge.  Zelda's hands reach out and pick up the
sign.

Shift to Gaspra, walking onscreen in front of a filled bookcase.]

GASPRA: Congratulations, Zelda.  You have prevailed.  Hurry now. You must
     travel to a place of festival. Rumor tells it is found in the great forest
     to the north. And remember, all is not what it seems.

[Gaspra turns to the bookcase, and the scene shifts to the crystal on Gaspra's
desk (which was not in the bookcase scene). Gaspra passes his hand over the
crystal, and the camera zooms in on the crystal. An image of the red willow
tree is shown in the crystal. Fade Out.

Fade in to image that was in the crystal, which is the outside of the shrine.
Zelda is in the lower left corner of the screen.]

 
OVERWORLD, PART II
Treasures: Empty Bottle, Flute, Harp, Life Potion, Raft, Water Bottle, Vial of
     Wind
Weapons: Feather, Jade Amulet, Joust, Pyros, Rings of Fire, Short Axe,
     Turquoise Ring 
Enemies: Blue Tektites, Octorok, Green Zora, Blue Zora, Sea Moby, Giant Squid,


Now that you've got control of Zelda again, notice that your heart meter has
increased by one heart.  Obtaining the Celestial Sign also gave you a Heart
Container automatically.  As you make your way to the next dungeon, there are
several side quests that can be completed to obtain new treasures and weapons.
First, if you didn't get the Magic Shield, Candle, Calm, or other stuff from
Overworld Part I, spend some time building up rupees and get them.  Then,
return to Vision Henge and we'll continue from there.

From Vision Henge, head down one screen abd right three screens to find a woman
who says she's exhausted from thirst.  Take the Empty Bottle here and head to
the river, two screens up at the Mobilin's Head Inn.  You'll find that the Red
Boots from the Shrine of Earth allow you to walk across this river.  For now,
trace the [a n t i t h e f t - t h o u l a t v g w s d o t c o m]river to it's
source, killing or avoiding enemies as you go.  The source of the river is five
screens to the right and two screens to the north of the Inn.  You'll recognize
it right away; there's a head-shaped fountain crying tears of blood, with water
coming from it's mouth.  I wouldn't drink water from this Bleeding Fountain, but
a thirsty woman will.  Stand in the water and use the Empty Bottle to get the
Water Bottle.  Take it to the Thirsty Woman, and use it near her.  She'll give
you the Vial of Wind, a red bottle, in return.

Now return to the Mobilin's Head Inn, and head up one screen, crossing the
river as you go.  Defeat the two Mobilins here and duck into the cave.  Sitting
out in the open here is the Harp.  Grab it and go back out the way you came.
The enemies on the other side are a bit too strong for you right now.  Go
up another screen and deal with more Mobilins.  A sign here pointing
to the east says something about "Findo."  Moving one screen in that direction
takes us to a strange, talking mushroom creature.  This, we must assume, is
Findo.  Findo makes a comment about the intelligence of Mobilins, but there's
nothing else to do here now, so move on to the north two screens.  This brings
you to the Meadow of Chotness, an area filled with Leevers, Blue Tektites, and
Mobys.

From this screen, up three and right one screen to find the entrance to a town.
This may be a bit confusing, if you look at the sign one screen north of here
and listen to the people.  Some of these folks call this town Wimbich, but the
sign calls it Chotness.  I'll use Wimbich for the most part, but be aware that
they're the same place.

Once here, whatever it's called, go left one screen - kill these two Blue
Tektites and pick up the Raft next to the water.  North one screen of the Raft
is the Market Square, the first place you can buy the Heart-restoring Life
Potion.  Unless you've got at least 500 rupees, don't buy a Life Potion yet.
Listen to the woman's tale of Warbei and his fortified retreat, as it sounds
like a place you'll be going later.

Go north one more screen to Upper Street.  Listen to the bored man and observe
that the dog is friendly; it'll even follow Zelda around a little.  There are
two shops to enter here.  Go in the right building first to find Madame
Pragal's Magic Shop.  Since she's a friend of the mysterious Shurmak, she'll
let you buy some weapons from her store.  Madame Pragal will mention the
Turquoise Ring (the silver and blue ring on the left side of the counter) and 
the Jade Amulet (the silver and green item on the right side), but she also
sells the Rings of Fire (the fireball on the far right of the store).  If you
have at least 40 rupees, buy the Turquoise Ring.  If you have enough rupees,
you can buy the other two weapons also, but be sure you have at least 20
rupees left.  Leave when you're done.  (At this point, you may encounter a bug.
Madame Pragal may begin speaking when you're outside the building - just ignore
it.)

Go into the other building, and listen to these fellows.  They have three
things to say, and you should always listen to everybody.  Note the Bone for
sell on the counter.  Buy it for 20 rupees, equip it, and leave.  Use the Bone
outside, and you'll receive the Short Axe.

Walk right one screen.  Inside the building here is a depressing fellow who
feels unappreciated.  Go in and listen, then leave and head down a screen.
The woman here, Evon, loves music and owes Shurmak for help given to her.  So,
she gives you the Flute.  Take it, and then listen to the Twins, Eric and Ean.
Inside the home is their father.  It seems the whole family has memory
problems.  Nothing else here, so leave.

Go down a screen and left a screen to return to where you found the Raft.
Continue left to find a Snake.  Remember what Evon said when she gave you the
Flute?  Try it out by using the Flute.  Be warned, however!  You want to be
very far from the Snake when you do use it, or you may die.  The Snake will
be trying to kill you, too, so don't waste time on using the Flute.  The
Flute will kill the Snake, which will cast, and drop, the Pyros spell.

Two screens south of the Snake is an old, run-down farm.  Complete with two
ghostly farmers!  One says he's been here for three hundred years.  The other
gives a valuable clue.

GHOST: Far away, one Gannon's allies lives in a world of water.  The entrance
     is hidden, and you may never find it if you fear the touch of falling
     water.  You can cross any ford in Scotton's River with the Red Boots.

Now, you've finished exploring Wimbich for the time being.  You can spend some
time building up rupees to buy the Life Potion and spells here if you need to
do so.  When you're ready to continue, return to the outside of the depressed
man's home to the right of Upper Street.

From there, go right two screens, meeting an Octorok and some Little Deelers as
you go.  Head north one screen to meet your first Green Zolas, fish-like
creatures found near water.  They'll throw spiked balls, but those are usually
easily avoided.  North one more screen will take you to another inn.  The man
outside will warn you, twice, about going inside.  Do so anyway, but since
there's little to do there, you'll leave quickly.  The man outside will then
give you the Feather, another weapon.


...And that's all for now.  More to come later.

   SECTION H : TREASURES   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

The items that Zelda can find and use on her adventure are divided into two
categories on the Inventory screen: Treasures and Weapons.  Here I will list
the items, quote the manual's description of the items, and tell a little more
information, like where each item can be found.

Before Zelda can use any item (yes, including rupees), you'll have to go into
the inventory screen and select that item.  When you exit the inventory, Zelda
will try to use the item when you press Button One.  If the item has no effect
in the area, you'll hear a beep.

IMPORTANT: Don't forget to change your equipped item back to Zelda's wand
before going into the wilderness or after using a spell. If you do, you might
find Zelda dying while trying to use the wrong item!


Candles - These are bought in shops for 100 rupees.

Manual description:
"Use candles to lighten dark rooms.  Each candle may be used only once."


Compass - One is found in each dungeon, usually by clearing a room of enemies.
Obtaining the compass for a shrine causes the treasure room of the shrine to
appear as a blue square on your map.

Manual description:
"When the shrines were first constructed, Gannon gave each shrine keeper a
compass to the shrine he or she was to guard.  These compasses have the power
of teleportation, which is handy when you want to get to a shrine quickly."


Harp - Found in a cave one screen north of the Mobilin Head Inn.  The Harp
continues a tradition of the Zelda series: musical instruments that allow fast
travel.  This particular instrument allows you to warp back to the beginning
of a dungeon.

Manual description:
"The magical harp is known to also have the power of teleportation.  It is
rumored that, in shrines, it can be used to go back to the beginning of a
shrine."


Keys -  Haven't found any yet, but they're probably in shrines.  The number of
keys you currently have can be seen on the Inventory screen.

Manual description:
"Use keys to open locked doors.  To enter an open door, just walk up to it and
go into the next room.  Some doors lead nowhere; they are there to deceive you.
When you have a key, you pass through and one key is subtracted from your
inventory.  Once a door is unlocked, it remains open for the rest of the game."


Life Potion -  This is sold for 200 rupees in a few places.  You can only have
one Life Potion at a time, but you can buy another when you've used one up.
Using it will refill your Heart Meter.

Manual description:
"(blue container) This potion restores Zelda to full life."


Magic Shield - It's sold in a shop for 500 rupees.  It also can't protect Zelda
from boss' attacks.

Manual description:
"This shield has magical abilities to protect Zelda from enemy weapon attacks.
Because it uses magic, Zelda must concentrate to make it work."


Rafts -  Found in Wimbich.

Manual description:
"Ride a raft across water.  If a raft is available, it appears in the location
where it can be used, or it can be selected from the inventory screen.  Walk
onto the raft and it starts to move.  You can walk around on the raft, but you
can get off until it stops at its destination."


Repellent -  Haven't found this one yet.

Manual description:
"(bottle marked X) This scares away Swamp Zolas."


Rupees - Ah, good ol' rupees. The traditional form of money in the Zelda series
returns, but it's used a little differently than usual here.  Players of The
Legend of Zelda may remember that firing arrows used up one rupee per arrow in
that game. ZA has a similar affect; see the Weapons subsection for more
details.

Rupees come in two denominations: Blue (worth 5 rupees) and Yellow (worth 10
rupees).  Defeating some enemies, like bosses, may earn you more.

Manual description:
"(currency of Tolemac) Collect rupees by defeating monsters.  When you have at
least one rupee, it appears in your inventory.  If you wish to buy an item,
stand close to it so the price flashes.  Select the rupee from your inventory
screen.  If you have enough rupees to purchase the item, click Button One and
it appears in your inventory.  The cost in rupees will be subtracted from your
total.  Also, some creatures may demand that you give them money to pass
through a gate or take a boat ride."


Vial of Wind -  Give the Water Bottle to the Thirsty Woman in exchange for
this.

Manual description:
"Creates wind to move the rafts when there is no breeze."


The remainder of the Treasures aren't listed in the manual.

Bone - It looks like the leg bone of some animal.  Buy it for 20 rupees in a
store on Upper Street.

Empty Bottle - Obtained from a thirsty woman after finishing the Shrine of
Earth.

Flute - Obtained from Evon, a music lover in Wimbich, who owes Shurmak.
It can "calm the savage hiss of a snake."

Golden Boots -  Found in the Borokno Marsh village.  Effect currently unknown.

Ladder - Found in a tree 5 screens south and 1 screen west of Vision Henge.
Use it to cross the rift found early in the Shrine of Earth.

Red Boots - Found in the Shrine of Earth.  These allow you to cross the river 
north of Vision Henge and the Mobilin's Head Inn.  They work automatically, and
do not need to be equipped.

Water Bottle - Use the Empty Bottle and the Bleeding Fountain, and you'll get
a bottle of water - the perfect thing to quench someone's thirst.

   SECTION I : WEAPONS   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

Check the start of the Treasures section just above this one for an important
reminder about equipping Zelda's weapons and a breakdown of the item
descriptions in this section.

In truth, Zelda has only one weapon: the Wand.  All the other so-called
"weapons" are really a form of magic spells cast through the Wand and consuming
varying amounts of rupees when used.  The downsides to this are that it's very
easy to run out of rupees in a boss fight and the only way to replenish Zelda's
supply of magic is to spend some time killing more monsters.

The Wand, which Zelda finds very early in the game, can be used in the same
manner that Link uses a sword in most Zelda games: press Button One with the
Wand equipped, and Zelda swings it in front of her, hitting anything within
range.  If Zelda has one of the magic spells equipped, then pressing Button One
will cause two things to happen.  First, Zelda will swing the Wand in front of
her as normal. Second, the effect of the spell will appear on screen while the
Wand is still swinging.  This is always true unless the effect of the spell is
already on screen; in that case, Zelda just swings the wand.  Different spells 
will have different effects, of course.  The Wand grows stronger as Zelda
herself grows stronger.


These are the spells Zelda can find or buy from NPCs:

Boomerang -  Haven't found this one yet.

Manual description:
"This is a good weapon when you need to hit something from a distance."


Bow & Arrow -  Haven't found this one yet.

Manual description:
"This spell shoots arrows at opponents or objects.  Known for its speed and
precision, it is a good weapon to use for hitting creatures and moving targets
that are out of reach."


Broadsword -  Haven't found this one yet.

Manual description:
"This spell shoots flying swords at enemies.  It is fairly strong and can be
used against certain knights who fight with broadswords."


Calm - It's sold at the Mobilin's Head Inn for 100 rupees.  When used, a
spread of three small whirlwinds is sent out in the direction Zelda is facing,
and spread out as they travel.  Requires 1 rupee to use.

Manual description:
"This spell has the power to calm the elements."


Dagger- It's given to you at the Mobilin's Head Inn for free.  When used, one
dagger is fired in the direction Zelda faces.  It's a lot like the old
short-shooting effect in The Legend of Zelda, except it costs 2 rupees.

Manual description:
"This is a moderately weak spell, but it moves quickly through the air.  The
dagger was once used exclusively by the 'Great Magic Users' who now call the
power of sound waves as a means of destruction."


Feather -  Given to Zelda by a man as a sign of his affection.  He disappears
afterward.

Manual description:
"Aviana, the keeper of the Shrine of Air, lost one of her feathers while flying
across Tolemac.  Her feather can be used as a weapon, but Aviana fears that her
own power could be turned against her."


Firestorm - Give 5 rupees to the woman outside the Mobilin's Head Inn and this
will be your reward.  When used, it'll shoot a fireball in the four cardinal
directions (N/S/E/W) around Zelda for 1 rupee.

Manual description:</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
"This spell uses the power of fire to attack enemies coming from many
directions at once."


Gold Necklace -  Haven't found this one yet.

Manual description:
"Once owned by a knight, the necklace is used to call upon the powers of
accuracy and fire.  The necklace was stolen one day by a child who thought it
could be sold for food and water."

small green whirlwinds for 24 rupees.

A large, green, triangle shaped bolt of magic is fired in the direction Zelda

Noise -  Haven't found this one yet.

Manual description:
"This spell, similar to the weapon used by the 'Great Magic Users,' calls upon
the power of sound.  While rather weak, it is effective against creatures that
are sensitive to sound."


Pyros -  Calm down a deadly snake to get this spell.  A wall of several flames
will appear before Zelda.

to protect you from attack."

   SECTION J: MAJOR CHARACTERS   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

These are the important people in ZA.

Zelda - Our Heroine, the Princess of Hyrule. The female members of her family
are traditionally kidnapped by Gannon, only to be rescued by Link (or his
ancestors or descendants, depending on who you ask!). This time, it's Zelda's
turn to shine!

Gannon - Zelda and Link's ultimate enemy! Also known in other games as Ganon,
Ganondorf Dragmire, the Prince of Darkness, and the King of Darkness. Gannon
has captured Link and stolen the seven celestial signs that Zelda must recover.

Link - The traditional hero of the Zelda series, Link (or his ancestors or
descendants, depending on who you ask), has a history of rescuing Zelda and
her family from Gannon's evil clutches.  Link (or his ancestors... well, you
get the idea!) is also known as the Hero of Hyrule and the Hero of Time.

Gaspra - Hyrule's court astronomer.  He sends Zelda on her quest and gives her
helpful advice as the game proceeds.

Shurmak - An old woman who projects her voice to provide advice and help Zelda
on the quest.  She that claims to have been watching Zelda since the
princess' childhood.


»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»
   SECTION K: MAJOR PLACES  
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

These are the major areas and landmarks that Zelda will visit on her journey.

Vision Henge - Zelda starts the game here, and will start here if she dies in
the Overworld or you quit a game in the Overworld and continue the game later.

Safe Haven - The screens immediately surrounding Vision Henge, and forming a
square.  There are no enemies here, and each screen contains a monument with a
design that (presumably) matches each celestial sign.

Shrine of Earth- The first shrine Zelda will explore.  A red willow tree marks
it's entrance.

Wimbich - Also known as Chotness.  A source of many weapons and items.

   SECTION L: ENEMIES   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

The following chart lists all the important information about enemies.  Here's
a rundown of the chart's columns:

Name - The enemy's name, obviously.
HM - Heart Meter, or the amount of damage an enemy can take, assuming that
Zelda's wand does one Heart worth of damage.  In other words, the number of
wand hits needed to kill an enemy.
AAI - Attack Artificial Intelligence - Some enemies will move to attack Zelda
when they see her, whereas others will ignore Zelda or move in a predetermined
pattern.  If an enemy will try it's best to hit Zelda, it has AAI.
Drops - The kinds of items an enemy is known to drop when killed.  H stands for
Hearts, Y stands for Yellow Rupees, and B for Blue Rupees.
STR - Strength, or the amount of life one hit from an enemy removes from 
Zelda's Heart Meter.
Specials - Any special attacks or other unusual information.

   SECTION N: EMULATION FAQ   
»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»»

I've gotten a few emails about Zelda's Adventure and emulation, so here's the
answers to some common questions I've seen about the subject.

Q: Is there an emulator that can play Zelda's Adventure?
A: No.  There have been two CD-I emulators developed. One was never released.
   The other, CD-iCE, has been released, but only plays the game "Rise of the 
   Robots" at this time.  There may be a release in the future that can play 
   other games.  CD-iCE can be found at this URL, but please don't bug the guy
   about releasing the emulator: http://cdice.emuhq.com/

Q: Is there a place I can download a Zelda's Adventure ROM/ISO or a copy of the
   game?
A: I don't know.

Q: Will you make or send me a copy of Zelda's Adventure?
A: No.
