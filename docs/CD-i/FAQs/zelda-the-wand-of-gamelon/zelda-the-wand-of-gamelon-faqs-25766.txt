 Welcome to my ending FAQ, hope you enjoy game endings as much as I do.
 The main purpose of this FAQ is to list all the endings found on this game
 series, sometimes I will list a game - but that doesn't mean I have or know 
 the ending.
 So feel free to submit the endings I don't have and if I missed an ending 
 detail or you think I didn't explain the ending correctly, just send me an 
 email at:

 ** reyvgm at hotmail dot com **

 If you prefer to see the ending in image format, just go to the VGMuseum URL
 I will display at the end of each ending, as long as I have the ending in
 image format, of course.

 You can check more than 4000 endings for multiple consoles and portables  
 at the Video Games Museum - http://www.vgmuseum.com

 I try my best to beat all games, but sometimes time isn't enough to do it
 all. So if you know the ending for any of the following games please email
 the  ending description and the name you want to be credited to:

 ** reyvgm at hotmail dot com **


                 Here is the list of the endings I am missing:

  and Zelda holds up another, more text appears that says: "Finally, peace
  returns to Hyrule, this ends the story." The credits roll, and then it 
  shows a screen with a single Triforce and a message. Depending if you

  Just beat Ganon.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After beating, Ganon the door will open and you will be in a room ready to
  receive the Triforce. Then The essence of the Triforce will say:
  "Welcome, Link...I am the essence of the Triforce. The Triforce will grant
  wishes in the heart and mind of the person who touches it. If a person
  with a good heart touches it, it will make his good wishes come true...
  If an Evil-hearted person touches it, it grants his evil wishes.
  Ganon's wish was to conquer the world. That wish changed the Golden Land
  to the Dark World. Ganon was building up his power here so he could
  conquer the Light World and make his wish come completely true.
  But now, you have totally destroyed Ganon. His dark world will vanish.
  The Triforce is waiting for a new owner, Its Golden Power is in your hands...
  Now touch it with a wish in your heart."
  Link then takes the Triforce. After that it will show various characters
  from the game like The King returning, your uncle recovering, the bully
  making a friend, the flute boy plays again, and such.
  Then it will show Link in the Lost Woods returning the Master Sword, a it 
  will say: "And the Master Sword sleeps again...FOREVER" as it shows the 
  Master Sword on its pedestal.
  The credits will roll, afterwards "The End" will appear, while showing the 
  number of times you died.

  You'll then leave the room with Zelda, encounter the old man, and He'll
  say: "If there are things yet to be done, now is your change to do them".
  Once you leave the room, the narrator will say "The time for Hyrule to 
  vanish has come. The adventure ends here".
  You'll get an image of Link by the campfire, with a text that reads:
  "The battle ended. Having fought with courage to the very last, your tale
  will surely become a legend to the passed down throughout eternity".
  A screen will tell you there's a present waiting for you and will 
  show you the playthrough results. At this screen, the narrator will say:
  "How was it, brave hero? Did you have any fun? A password will be shown

 2)How to get it:

  Good Ending: 
  Just beat Ganon before the time runs out on the 4th week.

  Bad Ending: 
  Let the time run out anywhere in the game.


 3)The ending from Master_Thief Garrett, and myself:

  Good Ending:
  After beating Ganon, the Hero goes out the Tower of Hera and meets Zelda. 
  She says "This high place is where it all began... Please look.
  The land of Hyrule... I never realized how beautiful it is until now. 
  Thank you, Hero of Light. This land has been saved thanks to your help. No
  words could express my gratitude... Thank you, truly. We will never forget
  what you have done... ... ..."
  The hero then goes back to the sanctuary, where Sahasrala will say: "You 
  have fought well for the sake of Hyrule, young one... I mean, Hero of
  Light. Because of you, Hyrule has been saved once more. Thank you.
  You only have a limited amount of time left in this world, but don't leave
  with any regrets."
  If you talk to the fortune teller, it will say "Hm, I can't see anything
  from your future now."
  Walk up and talk to the loyal Sage, "Ah, gods. These people have returned
  here safely. We offer our thanks."
  The scene will switch to the hero and Zelda coming down from Death
  Mountain, where they'll meet Agihna. All three walk towards the Lost 
  Woods to place the Master Sword back to its resting place. While they
  walk there, they converse the following:
  Agihna: "Ah, Princess Zelda is back. Princeeess! "
  Zelda: "I'm sorry for making you worry for me."
  Agihna: "I'm just glad you are unharmed. Now, first and foremost, we 
  need to take you back to the castle."
  Zelda: "No, we have no time. There is something I have to say before the 
  young one leaves our world and goes home. On Death Mountain I felt... 
  I felt Ganon's presence. I know the Evil King Ganon was felled by Link, 
  the Hero. His body was sealed, but his malicious essence could not be 
  sealed. It was through this evil energy's doing that the young one was 
  pulled into our world. If the young one's power had been taken by Ganon, 
  Hyrule would have fallen into deep darkness. I truly thank you. Because 
  of your wisdom, courage, and power, I am sure the future will be bright.
  The time for us to part is fast approaching."
  Once the hero places the Master Sword back in the pedestal, Agihna says: 
  "Farewell. You certainly overcame many hardships, didn't you?"
  The hero then disappears and Zelda shouts "Goodbyeeee...!"
  Sasharhala walks off. Zelda starts to leave, takes one last look back, 
  and then she too departs.
  The game will then congratulate you and you'll be taken to the credits
  and the results screen.

  Bad Ending:
  The hero will fall down in front of the witch's hut, and you'll get a
  message saying: "Oh, how could this happen? Too bad, you've run out 
  of time. But, I guess you gave it your best."
  The credits and the results screen will show.

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Ganon.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After you beat Ganon, Princess Zelda will start to use her magic
  to keep Ganon on the ground and says: "I'm using my power to hold the
  evil king! You use your sword and deliver the final blow."
  Her magic will fade and Link's Master Sword will start shining, Link then
  will slash Ganon twice and then it will stab him in the head.
  Ganon will stand up trashing about and Zelda will say: "Six sages... Now!"
  She will then invoke her magic and kneel down tired. Screen will change
  to the Chamber of Sages and Rauru will appear and say: "Ancient creators
  of Hyrule! Now, open the sealed door and send the Evil Incarnation of 
  Darkness into the void of the Evil Realm!!" He will start to invoke the
  magic, then Darunia appears and invokes also, then Ruto, then Nabooru, then
  Impa and Lastly Saria, then each of them will turn into a different set of
  magic ball and they shoot out into the center of the Chamber of Sages,
  creating a void. Ganon gets sucked in and he says: "YOU... CURSE YOU...ZELDA!
  CURSE YOU...SAGES!!"
  He appears on screen floating in the emptiness of the void and continues to
  say: "CURSE YOU...Link! Someday... When this seal is broken... That's when I
  will exterminate your descendants!!" With that he disappears and says: "As
  long as the Triforce of Power is in my hand..." Then Zelda and Link are shown
  "standing" in the sky and Zelda says: "Thank you, Link.... Thanks to you,
  Ganondorf has been sealed inside the Evil Realm! Thus, peace will once again
  reign in this world... for a time. All the tragedy that has befallen Hyrule
  was my doing... I was so young... I could not comprehend the consequences of
  trying to control the Sacred Realm. I dragged you into it, too. Now it is
  time for me to make up for my mistakes... You must lay the Master Sword to
  rest and close the Door of Time... However, by doing this, the road between 
  times will be closed..." Zelda extends her hand to Link and says: 
  "Link, give the Ocarina to me. As a Sage, I can return you to your original
  time with it."
  Link looks at the Ocarina and puts it in Zelda's hand, then Zelda puts her 
  other hand on top of Link's hand and looks at it with sad eyes. 
  Then Zelda says: " When peace returns to Hyrule... It will be time for us to
  say Good-bye... Now, go home, Link. Regain your lost time! Home... where you
  are supposed to be... the way you are supposed to be..." Zelda then plays the
  Ocarina and a blue light engulfs Link, and Zelda says: "Thank you... Link...
  Good-bye..." The credits will roll while it shows various sceneries from the
  game, such as Gerudo Valley, the Gerudo Fortress, Kakariko Town, 
  Death Mountain, Goron City, Lake Hylia, among others. After that they will
  show all the characters from the game, Gorons, Zoras, the people from the
  town, Epona, Malon, Talon, etc, having a party with a big fire with multiple
  colors at Lon Lon Ranch. Then it shows Mido sitting down next to the
  Zora King, he is sort of worried, he sees some sparkles falling down from the
  sky, he gets up and starts to look at 5 colored light spheres flying in the
  sky. Next screen shows the light spheres flying through Death Mountain and
  there it shows Impa, Ruto, Nabooru and Darunia with Saria on top of his head.
  Then the scene goes inside the Time Temple and and it shows the Master Sword
  and Link in front of it, Link is back to his child self again. Then Navi
  flies to the top of the Time Temple and leaves through a window, Link walks
  away and the camera does a close up on the Master Sword and it will show
  "Presented by Nintendo" Then it will show Zelda peeking through a window 
  inside Hyrule Castle and Link is  walking towards her, she turns her head
  and looks at Link, they both stand there looking at each other, just like the
  first time they met. The screen will freeze and change its colors to a light
  brown and it will say "The End. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time"

  From Jason:
  After the end, on the "The End" screen, if you wait a few minutes or so you
  will hear the Scarecrow song that you told the wandering Scarecrow in several
  different voices!

 1)Number of endings:

  1 + Variation


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Majora, with or without getting all the masks.


 3)The ending from the World of Nintendo:

  After you beat Majora's Wrath, it will show the four giants outside
  Clock Town trying to stop the moon. The moon gets destroyed and turns into
  a rainbow of debris. Everyone is standing around cheering. The screen turns
  white as itt says: "DAWN OF A NEW DAY."
  Link wakes up as Tatl and Tael are floating in front of him.
  They say: "Aah! He's awake!" Link sits up, with his horse behind him. 
  The camera looks at the four giants who are looking at Link. Then it pans
  down at the Skull Kid, who is not wearing the Majora's Mask. 
  He says: "You guys... You hadn't forgotten about me?"
  The giants make a noise. Skull Kid says: "You still thought of me as a
  friend?" The fairies fly over to the Skull Kid as the giants walk away.
  The Skull Kid says: "Did you... Did you save me? I thought they didn't want
  to be friends with me... But... they hadn't forgotten about me... Friends 
  are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh. Could you be my friend, too?" He walks
  up to Link and sniffs him. Then he says: "Eh-Hee-Hee...You have the same 
  smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods... 
  I know, I know! Let's do something." Out of nowhere the Mask Man appears
  holding the Majora's Mask and he says: "Oh...So the evil has left the mask
  after all... Well, now... I finally have it back. Since I am in the midst of
  my travels... I must bid you Farewell. Shouldn't you be returning home as
  well? Whenever there is a meeting. A parting sure to follow. However that
  parting need not last forever. Whether a parting last forever or merely for 
  a short time... that is up to you. With that, please excuse me..."
  He turns around and walks away. He stops looks back and says: "But my, you
  sure have managed to make quite a number of people happy. The masks you have
  are filled with happiness. This is truly a good happiness." He disappears.
  Tatl says: "Well, both of us have gotten what we were after... so this is
  where you and I part ways, isn't it? You know... it was kind of fun. Well
  it's almost time for the carnival to begin... So, why don't you just leave
  and go about your business? The rest of us have a carnival to go to."
  Link nods his head jumps on his horse and gallops away.
  As he gallops away, Talt yells: "Link! ....Thank you!"
  The credits will roll as they show various characters and scenes from the 
  game, they start in front of Clocktown, a bunch of fireworks start going 
  off inside Clocktown. Then it shows the Indigo Band playing a song.
  Then the Great Bay, the Pirates Fortress, Ikana canyon, the Deku King
  Princess and the monkey, etc.
  From here on, depending if you found a mask or not, you will either get
  a scene or just see a rotating 3D model of the mask you missed in a black 
  background (thanks Steven Cole).
  You'll see the Postman running, then in the Milk Bar the girls are dancing
  the dance you taught them, then you'll see the big fairies, then it shows 
  Cremia teaching Romani to shoot arrows on the ranch. Then the elderly couple

  to the milk bar and the Indy Go Gos are playing. Then it shows the father
  holding Pamela in Ikana Canyon. Then Kafei and Anju's wedding, with Tingle
  floating around. Then it shows the small sad Deku Tree you saw at the start
  with the Deku Butler in front of it looking at each other.
  The screen turns black and it shows you riding Epona in the Lost Woods. 
  Then it zooms in on a tree stump that has a drawing of Link, Skull kid and 
  the 4 giants on it. It plays a little bit of the song from the Lost Woods,
  and "The End" appears at the bottom.

 3)The ending from Mirkon:

  After beating all 3 forms of Puppet Ganon and then facing Gannondorf, the
  ending will start.
  Link parries Ganondorf, and buries the Master Sword in his forehead.
  The magic aura of the sword shatters.  Link remains holding the sword's hilt
  on Ganondorf's head.  Ganondorf falls to his knees on the floor.
  Ganondorf: "Ughnn... Heh heh... The wind.... It is blowing..."
  Link jumps off of Ganondorf, and the evil king turns into stone.
  The Master Sword is still embedded in his forehead.  Link breathes a sigh of
  relief, then goes back to holding his left arm.
  Zelda: "Link!!!"
  Zelda rushes to Link's side, supporting him.
  The King of Hyrule reappears.
  King: "My children... Listen to me. I have lived regretting the past.
  And I have faced those regrets. If only I could do things over again...
  Not a day of my life has gone by without my thoughts turning to my kingdom
  of old. I have lived bound to Hyrule. In that sense, I was the same as
  Ganondorf.
  But you... I want you to live for the future. There may be nothing left for 
  you... But despite that, you must look forward and walk a path of hope,
  trusting that it will sustain you when darkness comes. Farewell...
  This is the only world that your ancestors were able to leave you.
  Please...forgive us."
  Zelda looks down, saddened. She suddenly smiles and looks up at the King.
  Zelda: "W-Wait! You could... You could come with us!
  Yes, of course... We have a ship! We can find it. We WILL find it!
  The land that will be the next Hyrule! So..."
  King: "..."
  The King closes his eyes.
  King: "Ah, but child... That land will not be Hyrule. It will be YOUR land!"
  The floods from above suddenly come pouring down.  Link and Zelda are
  surrounded in large bubbles, protecting them from drowning.
  Zelda floats quickly upward.
  Link looks around, and sees the King.  He tries to swim to the King, his arm
  outstretched - the King briefly reaches for Link's hand;
  then pulls his hand back.
  Link is lifted upwards by the water and the King is lost out of sight.
  The screen goes black.
  King: "I have scattered the seeds of the future..."
  Link wakes up.  He is floating on the surface of the ocean.  He opens his
  eyes. Tetra, beside him, does the same.
  Komali flies in and hovers above them, smiling.
  Tetra looks back and Link does likewise.  Tetra's ship is behind them.
  Up in the crow's nest is Aryll.  Link smiles happily.  Tetra winks, and the
  two wave at the ship.  The pirates come to pick the two kids up out of the
  ocean. Medli and Makar are on the ship as well, waving.
  *CREDITS*
  (During the credits, characters' faces from throughout the game appear on
  bubbles that float upwards in the background, ending with bubbles of Link and
  Tetra smiling.  The background begins a dark blue, but gets lighter as the
  credits roll on.)
  The pirate ship is docked at Outset Island, as is Link's boat.
  The villagers - including Link's grandmother and sister - stand on the beach.
  A wind picks up, and fills the boat's sail.
  Link begins to slowly sail away.
  Tetra: "Anchors aweigh!!! Hold the tiller steady!!! As for our destination...
  The wind will guide us!"
  The pirate ship, likewise, begins to sail off into the distance.
  Aryll runs up to the end of the dock, and with watery eyes, waves to her
  brother, sailing off into the horizon.
  The ending screen appears, a cloudy sky in the background, with the Triforce
  in the center.
  Below it is "THE END," with "~THE LEGEND OF ZELDA~" towards the bottom of the
  screen. The Triforce pieces separate and spin off in different directions.
  The screen fades to black.

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Puppet Zelda, Ganon, and Ganondorf.


 3)The ending from Simone Smith, Asakane Kotoro:

  When you finish Ganondorf, there is a close up of his face, as he screams 
  out in pain. Link jumps backward and then everything fades to black...

  Ganon stands there, your blade in his belly, and spits "Do not think this 
  ends here... The history of light and shadow will be written in blood!" 
  He holds his hand out, and his Triforce fades. You then see Zant, and he 
  bends his neck to the left and you hear a snapping noise. You then see 
  Ganondorf's face, and his eyes go completely white as his head snaps 
  backwards in shock... You, Zelda, and Ganondorf stand there... And then the
  camera shows the horizon. You see the God's again all together, but after 
  they fade away, Link notices Midna! He starts running towards her uphill, 
  as fast as he can. When he reaches the top, you see a cloak over her as she's
  laying on the ground. As she slowly rises up, you see her form has changed. 
  She looks like a beautiful womanly form of the short, impish Midna you're so
  used to seeing. As Link sees her true form, he stammers backwards in awe. 
  The camera does a swirl around her, then closes up on her face as she says,
  "What? Say something! Am I so beautiful that you've no words left?" 
  You see Link smile and the screen fades to black...

  As the credits start rolling, we see many other scenes. The first one being 
  the Ordon Village kids beginning their journey back to Ordon Village, Rusl's
  wife is shown with a new baby, The Skull Kid is seen playing with the monkeys
  in the Sacred Grotto, The Gorons are seen enjoying a good sumo match, the
  Zora Prince and his people are seen swimming and enjoying the newfound peace
  as the deceased Zora Queen watches from above, the Yeti and his wife could be
  seen watching the sunrise on top of the snow mountain, finally the kids
  arrive at Ordon Village and are reunited with their parents. Close to the
  ending of the credits is a scene where Link is returning to Ordon Village.

  The last scene is in the Mirror of Twilight Chamber. You see Midna 
  (still in her true form), Link ,and Zelda all standing around the stone block
  where you stand to enter the twilight realm. Midna then says, "Well...
  I guess this is farewell, huh? Light and shadow can't mix, as we all know.
  But... Never forget that there's another world bound to this one." 
  Zelda then says to her, "Shadow and light are two sides of the same coin...
  One cannot exist without the other. I know now the reason the goddesses left
  the mirror of twilight in this world... They left it because it was their 
  design that we should meet. Yes... That is what I believe." 
  The camera closes up on Midna's face. "Zelda... Your words are kind and your 
  heart is true. If all in Hyrule are like you... Then maybe you'll do alright.
  Thank you. Well, the Princess spoke truly. As long as the mirror's around, 
  we could meet again". She sheds one glistening, white tear, and it floats in
  the air, and goes through the center of the mirror, and the mirror cracks
  from every angle, but does not break... Link and Zelda are distracted by
  this, so they don't see that Midna has run up to the pedestal you walk on
  to enter the twilight realm. She then says "Link... I... See you later..."
  From her feet up, her body forms white sparkles and descends into the mirror.
  After she has entered, the mirror shatters. The camera slowly goes upwards,
  and stares at the sky for a bit, then the screen goes back to the credits.
  The background changes to scenes around Hyrule again. You see Ilia and the
  kids get back home safely. You see that researcher in the site of the two
  statues near the Temple of Time. After a few more scenes, it shows that
  Triforce with the three women around it above Zelda's throne. 
  "The End" appears right below the Triforce.

  After you beat Ganon, Princess Zelda will start to use her magic

  rest and close the Door of Time... However, by doing this, the road between 
  times will be closed..." Zelda extends her hand to Link and says: 
  "Link, give the Ocarina to me. As a Sage, I can return you to your original
  time with it."
  Link looks at the Ocarina and puts it in Zelda's hand, then Zelda puts her 
  other hand on top of Link's hand and looks at it with sad eyes. 
  Then Zelda says: " When peace returns to Hyrule... It will be time for us to
  say Good-bye... Now, go home, Link. Regain your lost time! Home... where you
  are supposed to be... the way you are supposed to be..." Zelda then plays the
  Ocarina and a blue light engulfs Link, and Zelda says: "Thank you... Link...
  Good-bye..." The credits will roll while it shows various sceneries from the
  game, such as Gerudo Valley, the Gerudo Fortress, Kakariko Town, 
  Death Mountain, Goron City, Lake Hylia, among others. After that they will
  show all the characters from the game, Gorons, Zoras, the people from the
  town, Epona, Malon, Talon, etc, having a party with a big fire with multiple
  colors at Lon Lon Ranch. Then it shows Mido sitting down next to the
  Zora King, he is sort of worried, he sees some sparkles falling down from the
  sky, he gets up and starts to look at 5 colored light spheres flying in the
  sky. Next screen shows the light spheres flying through Death Mountain and
  there it shows Impa, Ruto, Nabooru and Darunia with Saria on top of his head.
  Then the scene goes inside the Time Temple and and it shows the Master Sword
  and Link in front of it, Link is back to his child self again. Then Navi
  flies to the top of the Time Temple and leaves through a window, Link walks
  away and the camera does a close up on the Master Sword and it will show
  "Presented by Nintendo" Then it will show Zelda peeking through a window 
  inside Hyrule Castle and Link is  walking towards her, she turns her head
  and looks at Link, they both stand there looking at each other, just like the
  first time they met. The screen will freeze and change its colors to a light
  brown and it will say "The End. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time"

  -The Legend of Zelda-
  After beating Gannon with the Silver arrow, he burns into a pile of ashes.
  Link then heads to the next room and finds Princess Zelda,
  he uses his sword to vanquish the flames. The screen grows dark and Zelda
  says: "Thanks Link, you are the hero of Hyrule." Link holds up one Triforce
  and Zelda holds up another, more text appears that says: "Finally, peace
  returns to Hyrule, this ends the story." The credits roll, and then it 
  shows a screen with a single Triforce and a message. Depending if you 
  finished the 1st or 2nd quest, the message will be different. 
  In the 1st quest, it says:

  "Thanks a million, Push Start to Replay".


  -The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time-
  After you beat Ganon, Princess Zelda will start to use her magic
  to keep Ganon on the ground and says: "I'm using my power to hold the
  evil king! You use your sword and deliver the final blow."
  Her magic will fade and Link's Master Sword will start shining, Link then
  will slash Ganon twice and then it will stab him in the head.
  Ganon will stand up trashing about and Zelda will say: "Six sages... Now!"
  She will then invoke her magic and kneel down tired. Screen will change
  to the Chamber of Sages and Rauru will appear and say: "Ancient creators
  of Hyrule! Now, open the sealed door and send the Evil Incarnation of 
  Darkness into the void of the Evil Realm!!" He will start to invoke the
  magic, then Darunia appears and invokes also, then Ruto, then Nabooru, then
  Impa and Lastly Saria, then each of them will turn into a different set of
  magic ball and they shoot out into the center of the Chamber of Sages,
  creating a void. Ganon gets sucked in and he says: "YOU... CURSE YOU...ZELDA!
  CURSE YOU...SAGES!!"
  He appears on screen floating in the emptiness of the void and continues to
  say: "CURSE YOU...Link! Someday... When this seal is broken... That's when I</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
  will exterminate your descendants!!" With that he disappears and says: "As
  long as the Triforce of Power is in my hand..." Then Zelda and Link are shown
  "standing" in the sky and Zelda says: "Thank you, Link.... Thanks to you,
  Ganondorf has been sealed inside the Evil Realm! Thus, peace will once again
  reign in this world... for a time. All the tragedy that has befallen Hyrule
  was my doing... I was so young... I could not comprehend the consequences of
  trying to control the Sacred Realm. I dragged you into it, too. Now it is
  time for me to make up for my mistakes... You must lay the Master Sword to
  rest and close the Door of Time... However, by doing this, the road between 
  times will be closed..." Zelda extends her hand to Link and says: 
  "Link, give the Ocarina to me. As a Sage, I can return you to your original
  time with it."
  Link looks at the Ocarina and puts it in Zelda's hand, then Zelda puts her 
  other hand on top of Link's hand and looks at it with sad eyes. 
  Then Zelda says: " When peace returns to Hyrule... It will be time for us to
  say Good-bye... Now, go home, Link. Regain your lost time! Home... where you
  are supposed to be... the way you are supposed to be..." Zelda then plays the

  away and the camera does a close up on the Master Sword and it will show
  "Presented by Nintendo" Then it will show Zelda peeking through a window 
  inside Hyrule Castle and Link is  walking towards her, she turns her head
  and looks at Link, they both stand there looking at each other, just like the
  first time they met. The screen will freeze and change its colors to a light
  brown and it will say "The End. The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time"


  -The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask-
   After you beat Majora's Wrath, it will show the four giants outside
  Clock Town trying to stop the moon. The moon gets destroyed and turns into
  a rainbow of debris. Everyone is standing around cheering. The screen turns
  white as itt says: "DAWN OF A NEW DAY."
  Link wakes up as Tatl and Tael are floating in front of him.
  They say: "Aah! He's awake!" Link sits up, with his horse behind him. 
  The camera looks at the four giants who are looking at Link. Then it pans
  down at the Skull Kid, who is not wearing the Majora's Mask. 
  He says: "You guys... You hadn't forgotten about me?"
  The giants make a noise. Skull Kid says: "You still thought of me as a
  friend?" The fairies fly over to the Skull Kid as the giants walk away.
  The Skull Kid says: "Did you... Did you save me? I thought they didn't want
  to be friends with me... But... they hadn't forgotten about me... Friends 
  are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh. Could you be my friend, too?" He walks
  up to Link and sniffs him. Then he says: "Eh-Hee-Hee...You have the same 
  smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods... 
  I know, I know! Let's do something." Out of nowhere the Mask Man appears
  holding the Majora's Mask and he says: "Oh...So the evil has left the mask
  after all... Well, now... I finally have it back. Since I am in the midst of
  my travels... I must bid you Farewell. Shouldn't you be returning home as
  well? Whenever there is a meeting. A parting sure to follow. However that
  parting need not last forever. Whether a parting last forever or merely for 
  a short time... that is up to you. With that, please excuse me..."
  He turns around and walks away. He stops looks back and says: "But my, you
  sure have managed to make quite a number of people happy. The masks you have
  are filled with happiness. This is truly a good happiness." He disappears.
  Tatl says: "Well, both of us have gotten what we were after... so this is
  where you and I part ways, isn't it? You know... it was kind of fun. Well
  it's almost time for the carnival to begin... So, why don't you just leave
  and go about your business? The rest of us have a carnival to go to."
  Link nods his head jumps on his horse and gallops away.
  As he gallops away, Talt yells: "Link! ....Thank you!"
  The credits will roll as they show various characters and scenes from the 
  game, they start in front of Clocktown, a bunch of fireworks start going 
  off inside Clocktown. Then it shows the Indigo Band playing a song.
  Then the Great Bay, the Pirates Fortress, Ikana canyon, the Deku King
  Princess and the monkey, etc.
  From here on, depending if you found a mask or not, you will either get
  a scene or just see a rotating 3D model of the mask you missed in a black 
  background (thanks Steven Cole).
  You'll see the Postman running, then in the Milk Bar the girls are dancing
  the dance you taught them, then you'll see the big fairies, then it shows 
  Cremia teaching Romani to shoot arrows on the ranch. Then the elderly couple
  in Clock Town. Then Grog and the chickens on Romani Ranch. Then it goes back
  to the milk bar and the Indy Go Gos are playing. Then it shows the father
  holding Pamela in Ikana Canyon. Then Kafei and Anju's wedding, with Tingle
  floating around. Then it shows the small sad Deku Tree you saw at the start
  with the Deku Butler in front of it looking at each other.
  The screen turns black and it shows you riding Epona in the Lost Woods. 
  Then it zooms in on a tree stump that has a drawing of Link, Skull kid and 
  the 4 giants on it. It plays a little bit of the song from the Lost Woods,
  and "The End" appears at the bottom.

  Just beat Vaati and Ganon in Hyrulean Adventure.

  Finish Navi's Trackers (Japanese version only)


 3)The ending from DEVIMON02:

  -Hyrulean Adventure-
  After beating Ganon, Zelda will say: 
  "Now! Hold the Four Sword over your head!"
  Ganon: "Gyaaaaaaa! What... What have you done? I am the King of Darkness!
  I cannot be destroyed by insects like you! Noooo!!!"
  Ganon is sucked into the Four Sword, and the six maidens talk to Link.
  "... ... Link.
  We whom you protected, and all of Hyrule as well...
  We will struggle together and grow stronger than before. We will work as 
  one, as the four of you have done. We will work...together.
  Now, the Four Sword... Place the sword that sealed away the darkness on the
  pedestal".
  At the shrine of the Four Sword the four swords fly into the air, the four 
  Links and the sword both combine into one again at the same time. Then the 
  sword jams into the pedestal and the six maidens return to their forms as 
  fairies and put a barrier on the sword.
  They then fly off and leave Princess Zelda and Link alone who both walk off
  together. The scene then fades off showing the Four Sword in its Pedestal.
  Then the credits begin and they show Kaepora Gaebora (the Owl) and the six
  maiden fairies fly across Hyrule in deferent scenes. They show Kakariko
  village and its people happy and at peace. They show Tingle on top of a
  mountain with what I would say 500,000 force gems. Also Talon and Malon 
  riding horses together. And it also shows Link walking down a stone walkway
  with tons of people cheering for him and shooting off fireworks.
  The game ends with Zelda looking out a window (maybe at link and his
  celebration) and then turning around and walking into a room with the
  Triforce marked above it.

 1)Number of endings:

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Puppet Zelda, Ganon, and Ganondorf.


 3)The ending from Simone Smith, Asakane Kotoro:

  When you finish Ganondorf, there is a close up of his face, as he screams 
  out in pain. Link jumps backward and then everything fades to black...

  Ganon stands there, your blade in his belly, and spits "Do not think this
  ends here... The history of light and shadow will be written in blood!" 
  He holds his hand out, and his Triforce fades. You then see Zant, and he 
  bends his neck to the left and you hear a snapping noise. You then see 
  Ganondorf's face, and his eyes go completely white as his head snaps 
  backwards in shock... You, Zelda, and Ganondorf stand there... And then the
  camera shows the horizon. You see the God's again all together, but after 
  they fade away, Link notices Midna! He starts running towards her uphill, 
  as fast as he can. When he reaches the top, you see a cloak over her as she's
  laying on the ground. As she slowly rises up, you see her form has changed. 
  She looks like a beautiful womanly form of the short, impish Midna you're so
  used to seeing. As Link sees her true form, he stammers backwards in awe. 
  The camera does a swirl around her, then closes up on her face as she says,
  "What? Say something! Am I so beautiful that you've no words left?" 
  You see Link smile and the screen fades to black...

  As the credits start rolling, we see many other scenes. The first one being 
  the Ordon Village kids beginning their journey back to Ordon Village, Rusl's
  wife is shown with a new baby, The Skull Kid is seen playing with the monkeys
  in the Sacred Grotto, The Gorons are seen enjoying a good sumo match, the
  Zora Prince and his people are seen swimming and enjoying the newfound peace
  as the deceased Zora Queen watches from above, the Yeti and his wife could be
  seen watching the sunrise on top of the snow mountain, finally the kids
  arrive at Ordon Village and are reunited with their parents. Close to the
  ending of the credits is a scene where Link is returning to Ordon Village.

  The last scene is in the Mirror of Twilight Chamber. You see Midna 
  (still in her true form), Link ,and Zelda all standing around the stone block
  where you stand to enter the twilight realm. Midna then says, "Well...
  I guess this is farewell, huh? Light and shadow can't mix, as we all know.
  But... Never forget that there's another world bound to this one." 
  Zelda then says to her, "Shadow and light are two sides of the same coin...
  One cannot exist without the other. I know now the reason the goddesses left
  the mirror of twilight in this world... They left it because it was their 
  design that we should meet. Yes... That is what I believe." 
  The camera closes up on Midna's face. "Zelda... Your words are kind and your 
  heart is true. If all in Hyrule are like you... Then maybe you'll do alright.
  Thank you. Well, the Princess spoke truly. As long as the mirror's around, 
  we could meet again". She sheds one glistening, white tear, and it floats in
  the air, and goes through the center of the mirror, and the mirror cracks
  from every angle, but does not break... Link and Zelda are distracted by
  this, so they don't see that Midna has run up to the pedestal you walk on
  to enter the twilight realm. She then says "Link... I... See you later..."
  From her feet up, her body forms white sparkles and descends into the mirror.
  After she has entered, the mirror shatters. The camera slowly goes upwards,
  and stares at the sky for a bit, then the screen goes back to the credits.
  The background changes to scenes around Hyrule again. You see Ilia and the
  kids get back home safely. You see that researcher in the site of the two
  statues near the Temple of Time. After a few more scenes, it shows that
  Triforce with the three women around it above Zelda's throne. 
  "The End" appears right below the Triforce.

 1)Number of endings:

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Demise.


 3)The ending from az47:
  
  After delivering the fatal blow to finish Demise off, he stands hunched over,
  and with no energy left he thrusts his sword to the ground where it shatters.
  Demise tells Link: "Extraordinary. You stand as a paragon of your kind,
  human. You fight like no man or demon I have ever known. Though this is not
  the end.
  My hate... never perishes. It is born anew in a cycle with no end!
  I will rise again!
  Those like you... Those who share the blood of the goddess and the spirit
  of the hero... They are eternally bound to this curse.
  An incarnation of my hatred shall ever follow your kind, dooming them to 
  wander a blood-soaked sea of darkness for all time!". 
  Demise's energy leaves his body and he disintegrates.
  Link looks at the Master Sword as it is aglow.  He then raises it to the sky
  as the dark fog left by Demise is drawn into it.  

  Fi calls to Link and says: "I have confirmed the eradication of the demon 
  king. His residual consciousness has been absorbed into the Master Sword...
  and is now sealed away."
  The scene shows Link standing before Impa. "You have done well, Link", 
  she says. Link turns to see Zelda and Groose smiling at him.  Zelda thanks
  Link and says, “Link... Thank you. I think it’s over... Finally... 
  it’s all over”. She then begins to cry.
  Groose laughs as he walks away and says, “Nice going, you two. 
  You guys were totally amazing in this little adventure I like to call the
  Legend of Groose. That’s a little joke”.
  Impa walks up to Groose and thanks him as well: "Joke or not, your 
  contributions to our efforts were heroic. You have my thanks."  
  Groose responds "Aww, well, you know... Just glad I could make myself
  useful. I’m happy things turned out OK."  
  Groose turns to Link and Zelda and says: "Hey, so things look pretty sewn 
  up here. What do you say, guys? Ready to head back to our time?
  Grannie was really worried about you two. We don’t want to keep the old girl
  in suspense too long".  
  Fi appears and tells the Goddess Hylia, or Zelda: "Hylia, Your Grace... 
  Or perhaps you prefer “Zelda.” It pleases me to know you are safe.
  ...Master, I must speak with you."
  Link and Fi walk up to the pedestal.
  "Master Link, you have successfully protected the goddess reborn and
  defeated Demise, fulfilling your role as the hero of legend.
  My purpose here is complete.
  Therefore, I ask you to dissolve our arrangement as master and servant.
  Drive the sword into the pedestal before you, and I will return to the
  sword to enter a sleep without end."
  Link is reluctant to do it and Fi says: "Master, you have achieved the 
  purpose you were chosen to fulfill. Please, set the sword in the pedestal 
  and bring the goddess’s mission to an end.
  Now, Master. It is time to conclude our necessary companionship."
  Fi then transforms herself to energy and hits him at the back of
  the head. Link looks at Zelda and places the sword into the pedestal.
  As Link turns to walk away, Fi calls out, “Link...
  Link, hear me. My purpose was to obey the command of the goddess and lead
  you, the chosen hero of this land, on your quest.
  When I first awoke and began this task, I perceived it as merely serving 
  my function as a servant to Her Grace.
  However, I have come to consider the information corresponding to our time
  together among the most precious data I have on record."
  Fi then appears, and tells Link "I do not have the capability to fully 
  understand the human spirit, Link...
  But now, at the end of my journey with you, as I prepare to sleep within the
  Master Sword forever, I experience a feeling I am unable to identify.
  I lack sufficient data to be sure of my conclusion, but I believe this
  feeling correlates closest to what your people call... happiness.
  Our partnership is at an end, and even as we speak, I feel my consciousness
  fading away.
  Before I enter the sleep that call me to the sword, I wish to relay to you
  words that I recorded many times over the course of our journey.
  Many have said them to you thus far, but I now wish to say them for myself...
  Thank you, Master Link. May we meet again in another life..."
  Fi disappears and the sword glows.
  Zelda says: "What? Impa, why? Come with us!"
  Impa: "Zelda, Your Grace, you possess the memories of the goddess. You must
  understand why that is not possible. I am a being of this age. My place is
  here."
  Zelda: "I... I know that, but..."
  Impa: "You must return to your own time. I will take care of the gate once
  you have passed through."
  Zelda: "I... can’t do that. You and I have been through so much together. 
  I don’t want to leave you alone. Please, Impa. Come back with us."
  Impa: "Zelda, at the command of the goddess, I passed through the Gate of 
  Time, I did so to protect you and aid the fight to prevent the world’s 
  destruction.
  The last remnants of Demise are decaying slowly within the sword. Someone
  must stay behind to watch over this blade.
  His spirit must not reawaken. He must never be allowed to threaten the world
  again.
  This is the nature of the task given to my tribe.
  As a member of the Shiekah, the goddess’s chosen guardians, I gladly welcome
  this duty.
  Zelda, I shall watch over the Triforce.
  Its power is too great to leave in the grasp of man. Dependence on its might
  is an invitation to disaster.
  When it has served its purpose, it must be secreted away to lie dormant once
  again... the knowledge of its existence hidden from mortal history.
  These are the words the goddess spoke to me long ago. I remember them well.
  As do you, I’m sure."
  Zelda tries to give Impa her goddess bracelet, and Impa says: "Do not
  despair, Zelda. You and I will surely meet again someday".

  The next scene shows Zelda, Link and Groose arriving in the Sealed Temple 
  and the Gate of Time disappearing. Link and Groose run to the Priestess who
  is wearing the Goddess bracelet. Zelda smiles and walks to her. 
  The Priestess says, “...See? I told you we’d meet again."
  Zelda nods her head with understanding.  The Priestess then transforms into
  a glittering golden cloud and then is gone, Link, Zelda and Groose gasp.
  A sad Zelda says "Thank you for everything", and then a bright light shines
  at the great doors as they open to the outside. It shows the sword in the
  forest much like the Master Sword.

  The credits will start, and you'll see small cutscenes of Zelda's journey
  while Link was on his own journey.
  The first clips shows Zelda outside the Sealed Temple meeting old Impa,
  then going into Skyview Temple, and then praying in front of the altar
  with the goddess symbol.
  Second clip shows Zelda trying to enter the Earth Temple with the harp,
  but gets ambushed by some enemies. Then it shows her inside the temple,
  where Impa saves her. Then you see both of them walking towards the 
  Lanayru Desert, and finally the Temple of Time.
  The credits continue as the game shows various locations from Skyloft,
  temples, regions, etc. culminating with the Goddess Statue on Skyloft
  holding the Triforce.

  The scene is now at the Goddess Statue grounds. Zelda’s father, Cawlin
  and others rejoin Zelda, Link and Groose at the base of the Goddess Statue.
  Several Loftwings land to greet them as well. The scene shifts to Groose
  riding his Loftwing and waving to Zelda and Link who are standing in the
  hands of the Goddess Statue. Zelda turns to Link to tell him that she had
  always dreamed of the world below the clouds and of being on the surface.  
  Zelda tells Link: "Look around us! As a child, I always dreamed of a world
  below. I wanted to see the surface with my own eyes and feel the land’s warm
  breeze on my skin. I... I think I want to live here. I always want to feel
  solid ground beneath my feet, see the clouds above my head, and watch over
  the Triforce. 
  What about you, Link? What will you do now?"
  Link smiles for a moment and then looks to the sky to see two Loftwings 
  rising to the clouds. THE END.

 1)Number of endings:

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Ganondorf.


 3)The ending from Mirkon:

  After beating all 3 forms of Puppet Ganon and then facing Gannondorf, the
  ending will start.
  Link parries Ganondorf, and buries the Master Sword in his forehead.
  The magic aura of the sword shatters.  Link remains holding the sword's hilt
  on Ganondorf's head.  Ganondorf falls to his knees on the floor.
  Ganondorf: "Ughnn... Heh heh... The wind.... It is blowing..."
  Link jumps off of Ganondorf, and the evil king turns into stone.
  The Master Sword is still embedded in his forehead.  Link breathes a sigh of
  relief, then goes back to holding his left arm.
  Zelda: "Link!!!"
  Zelda rushes to Link's side, supporting him.
  The King of Hyrule reappears.
  King: "My children... Listen to me. I have lived regretting the past.
  And I have faced those regrets. If only I could do things over again...
  Not a day of my life has gone by without my thoughts turning to my kingdom
  of old. I have lived bound to Hyrule. In that sense, I was the same as
  Ganondorf.
  But you... I want you to live for the future. There may be nothing left for 
  you... But despite that, you must look forward and walk a path of hope,
  trusting that it will sustain you when darkness comes. Farewell...
  This is the only world that your ancestors were able to leave you.
  Please...forgive us."
  Zelda looks down, saddened. She suddenly smiles and looks up at the King.
  Zelda: "W-Wait! You could... You could come with us!
  Yes, of course... We have a ship! We can find it. We WILL find it!
  The land that will be the next Hyrule! So..."
  King: "..."
  The King closes his eyes.
  King: "Ah, but child... That land will not be Hyrule. It will be YOUR land!"
  The floods from above suddenly come pouring down.  Link and Zelda are
  surrounded in large bubbles, protecting them from drowning.
  Zelda floats quickly upward.
  Link looks around, and sees the King.  He tries to swim to the King, his arm
  outstretched - the King briefly reaches for Link's hand;
  then pulls his hand back.
  Link is lifted upwards by the water and the King is lost out of sight.
  The screen goes black.
  King: "I have scattered the seeds of the future..."
  Link wakes up.  He is floating on the surface of the ocean.  He opens his
  eyes. Tetra, beside him, does the same.
  Komali flies in and hovers above them, smiling.
  Tetra looks back and Link does likewise.  Tetra's ship is behind them.
  Up in the crow's nest is Aryll.  Link smiles happily.  Tetra winks, and the
  two wave at the ship.  The pirates come to pick the two kids up out of the
  ocean. Medli and Makar are on the ship as well, waving.
  *CREDITS*
  (During the credits, characters' faces from throughout the game appear on
  bubbles that float upwards in the background, ending with bubbles of Link and
  Tetra smiling.  The background begins a dark blue, but gets lighter as the
  credits roll on.)
  The pirate ship is docked at Outset Island, as is Link's boat.
  The villagers - including Link's grandmother and sister - stand on the beach.
  A wind picks up, and fills the boat's sail.
  Link begins to slowly sail away.
  Tetra: "Anchors aweigh!!! Hold the tiller steady!!! As for our destination...
  The wind will guide us!"
  The pirate ship, likewise, begins to sail off into the distance.
  Aryll runs up to the end of the dock, and with watery eyes, waves to her
  brother, sailing off into the horizon.
  The screen shifts to a cloudy sky and the words "THE END," appear.

           --------------------------------------------------------

 1)Number of endings:

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Puppet Zelda, Ganon, and Ganondorf.


 3)The ending from Simone Smith, Asakane Kotoro:

  When you finish Ganondorf, there is a close up of his face, as he screams 
  out in pain. Link jumps backward and then everything fades to black...

  Ganon stands there, your blade in his belly, and spits "Do not think this 
  ends here... The history of light and shadow will be written in blood!" 
  He holds his hand out, and his Triforce fades. You then see Zant, and he 
  bends his neck to the left and you hear a snapping noise. You then see 
  Ganondorf's face, and his eyes go completely white as his head snaps 
  backwards in shock... You, Zelda, and Ganondorf stand there... And then the 
  camera shows the horizon. You see the God's again all together, but after 
  they fade away, Link notices Midna! He starts running towards her uphill, 
  as fast as he can. When he reaches the top, you see a cloak over her as she's
  laying on the ground. As she slowly rises up, you see her form has changed. 
  She looks like a beautiful womanly form of the short, impish Midna you're so 
  used to seeing. As Link sees her true form, he stammers backwards in awe. 
  The camera does a swirl around her, then closes up on her face as she says, 
  "What? Say something! Am I so beautiful that you've no words left?" 
  You see Link smile and the screen fades to black...

  As the credits start rolling, we see many other scenes. The first one being 
  the Ordon Village kids beginning their journey back to Ordon Village, Rusl's
  wife is shown with a new baby, The Skull Kid is seen playing with the monkeys
  in the Sacred Grotto, The Gorons are seen enjoying a good sumo match, the
  Zora Prince and his people are seen swimming and enjoying the newfound peace
  as the deceased Zora Queen watches from above, the Yeti and his wife could be
  seen watching the sunrise on top of the snow mountain, finally the kids arrive
  at Ordon Village and are reunited with their parents. Close to the ending of
  the credits is a scene where Link is returning to Ordon Village.

  The last scene is in the Mirror of Twilight Chamber. You see Midna 
  (still in her true form), Link ,and Zelda all standing around the stone
  block where you stand to enter the twilight realm. Midna then says, "Well...
  I guess this is farewell, huh? Light and shadow can't mix, as we all know.
  But... Never forget that there's another world bound to this one." 
  Zelda then says to her, "Shadow and light are two sides of the same coin...
  One cannot exist without the other. I know now the reason the goddesses left
  the mirror of twilight in this world... They left it because it was their 
  design that we should meet. Yes... That is what I believe." 
  The camera closes up on Midna's face. "Zelda... Your words are kind and your
  heart is true. If all in Hyrule are like you... Then maybe you'll do alright.
  Thank you. Well, the Princess spoke truly. As long as the mirror's around, 
  we could meet again". She sheds one glistening, white tear, and it floats in
  the air, and goes through the center of the mirror, and the mirror cracks
  from every angle, but does not break... Link and Zelda are distracted by
  this, so they don't see that Midna has run up to the pedestal you walk on
  to enter the twilight realm. She then says "Link... I... See you later..."
  From her feet up, her body forms white sparkles and descends into the mirror.
  After she has entered, the mirror shatters. The camera slowly goes upwards,
  and stares at the sky for a bit, then the screen goes back to the credits.
  The background changes to scenes around Hyrule again. You see Ilia and the
  kids get back home safely. You see that researcher in the site of the two
  statues near the Temple of Time. After a few more scenes, it shows that
  Triforce with the three women around it above Zelda's throne. 
  "The End" appears right below the Triforce. You'll then see the credits for
  the HD version.

 1)Number of endings:

  1 + Extra Scene


 2)How to get it:

  Defeat Calamity Ganon


 3)The ending from myself:

  After dealing the last blow to Dark Beast Ganon, Zelda will shoot out of 
  him as a beam of light. She drops to the floor and starts emanating her
  light. Ganon tries to attack Zelda, but she calls upon the power of the 
  Triforce and a huge ball of light engulfs and destroys Calamity Ganon.
  The red sky starts to dissipate, turning blue; as Zelda's backside faces
  Link, she says: "I've been keeping watch over you all this time..." 
  Link walks towards Zelda, she continues: "I've witnessed your struggles
  to return to us as well as your trials in battle. I always thought-no,
  I always believed- that you would find a way to defeat Ganon."
  Zelda turns to face Link, saying: "I never lost faith in you over these
  many years..."
  The camera pans up showing Zelda's face, as she says: "Thank you, Link...
  ...the Hero of Hyrule. May I ask... do you really remember me?"
  Link stands there giving no answer.
  The credits will roll, showing several locations and characters encountered
  throughout the game.
  Afterwards, Link and Zelda look at Hyrule Castle's gate in Castle Town. 
  They start walking away, and the camera moves to show the spirit of the 
  King and the four Champions looking down from Hyrule Castle's central tower.
  They vanish, Zelda stops, turns and looks at the tower. The camera pans 
  up and "The End" appears.
  If you found all the memories, there will be an extra scene.
  It shows Zelda and Link on a hilltop, facing Hyrule Castle. Zelda says,
  while looking at the Sheikah Slate:
  "We'll make our way to Zora's Domain. Divine Beast Vah Ruta... looks like
  it stopped working. Let's investigate the situation. 
  Mipha's father... I believe he would like to hear more about her. The least
  we can do is visit him and offer him some closure.
  Although Ganon is gone for now, there is still so much more for us to do.
  And so many painful memories that we must bear. I believe in my heart,
  that if all of us work together... we can restore Hyrule to its former
  glory. Perhaps...even beyond. But it all must start with us."
  Zelda starts to walk away as she says: "Let's be off."
  She then stops, her back facing Link, and says: "I can no longer hear the 
  voice inside the sword. I supposed it would make sense if my power had 
  dwindled over the past 100 years..."
  Zelda turns to Link, smiles and says: "I'm surprised to admit it... 
  But I can accept that." 
  She then smiles, Link runs towards her, and they both walk to their horses 
  as the camera zooms way out showing a Silent Princess flower on a hillside.

  Beat Veran on the first story.

  Beat Twinrova and Ganon on the second story.


 3)The ending from myself:

  First story:
  After you beat Veran, she will say: "My... My body withers... But you are too
  late! My role... was to disrupt the currents of time... To flood humanity in
  sorrow... The despair that fills this land has already passed through this
  tower and on to Twinrova! I see it... Burning blue... The Flame of Sorrow!!!
  Hah hah hah..." After that, Veran dies. Then the scene goes outside the tower
  and it shows Nayru and Ralph in front of the door and they say: "Link...
  What's happening inside...?" Suddenly Link breaks out through the blocked
  door and Nayru says: "Link!!! I'm so glad you're safe! Thank goodness!"
  Then Ralph says: "You really beat Veran, didn't you? Nice work, Link!
  You're amazing! ...Huh? Queen Ambi? She saw you get shut in and turned and
  ran." Nayru says: "Let us go!" The scene then goes to Lynna Town where they
  bump into Queen Ambi and her guards and Nayru says: "What? Are you gonna take
  on Ralph?" Queen Ambi then says: "Link! You are safe! I just called my
  knights from the palace to help since you were locked inside the tower..."
  Then Ralph says: "Don't startle me like that! I thought Veran's tricks had
  gotten to you!" Queen Ambi continues: "Link, thanks to you, everyone is back 
  to normal. I thank you." 
  It will then show various scenes of previously frozen people in
  stone starting to move again. Screen goes back to Link and Ralph says:
  "Link! My respect for you has grown. I thought it was over when you got
  locked in the tower. I never thought you'd outdo me!" Queen Ambi will say:
  "Ralph is my grandson's ...Grandson! You, too, have great courage. You shall
  be the pride of my people." Then Ralph will say: "And you, Queen Ambi! Veran
  is gone, so now you can be my great, great, great, great, great, great,
  grandmother! A queen! I'm so proud!" Queen Ambi will say: "How rude! I am
  still young! Don't call me granny!" Nayru then says: "I am reluctant to part,
  but we must return to our own age." The screen goes into a close-up of Nayru,
  Ralph, Queen Ambi and Link and Queen Ambi says: "All is well in this age! You
  may return without worry. We shall never forget you."
  You then realize you have been watched by Twinrova through their magic flame
  and they say: "Eee hee hee hee! Link! Don't think it ends here! Behold,
  Veran! The troubles you've caused have filled the land with cries of sorrow!
  It has given birth to the Flame of Sorrow, which burns brightly! When this
  flame brightens the darkness, our wish will be granted! Oh ho ho ho ho!"
  It will show a close-up of Koume in the dark and the screen will change to
  "The Legend of Zelda ~Oracle of Ages~" in big letters.
  Then it shows Nayru, Ralph, Impa and Link in front of the Maku Tree, and
  Ralph gets shocked when he sees a statue of Link holding a sword.
  The credits will roll while it shows Nayru singing to an audience of animals
  and Maple flying near. Then it shows another screen with Link trying to teach
  Ralph the spinning sword slash and when Ralph does it he gets dizzy.
  Next scene shows Queen Ambi in the past watching over Link's statue while
  they are making it and then when they put it next to the infant Maku Tree.
  It will keep showing the credits with a view of the castle in the background,
  another still shot will show a sunset anda bunch of birds in the sky,
  then the game will give you a password to continue the game on the next game
  and it will say: "To be continued in....Oracle of Seasons."

  Second story:
  After you beat Twinrova and Ganon, he will say: "Gwoh hoh hoh!
  I am the evil king, Ganon..." He disappears and you get to go up the stairs.
  You will find Zelda lying in the altar, get next to her and she will wake up
  and start talking to you: "Uhhn...Link! ...it's ended. Thank you, Link. You
  halted the completion of the rites that would have revived Ganon! Since they
  could not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could only
  revive a mindless, raging Ganon. Your power, wisdom and courage were able to
  prevent Twinrova's planned resurrection of Ganon. Now hope and peace can
  return to the hearts of the people. Thank you! You are a true hero! Let us
  return to the others!
  The castle starts to crumble and Zelda says: "Oh no!!! The castle is
  crumbling now that the powers of shadow wane! We must get out of here! </pre><pre id="faqspan-3">
  What do we do...? The leaves from the Maku Tree will start floating down
  and the Maku Tree will say: 
  "Link, You did it! I knew you could! Leave this to me!" Zelda casts some
  spell that gets you both out of there. Then Zelda and you appear in front of
  the Maku Tree and it says: "Welcome back, Link! Now the world is at peace!
  I knew you could do it, Link (a little heart besides Link's name). And I knew
  you'd come back... (another little heart besides Link's name)."
  Nayru will get in front of Zelda and say: "Welcome back, Zelda, and you too,
  Link. It's all over, isn't it?" Then Din says:  "I knew you would find a way,
  Link! Let us dance together again!" Then Impa gets in front of Zelda
  and says: "Zelda! I'm glad to see you return safely... Link! You are all
  I expected! I always believed in you!" Then Zelda speaks: "Link.... The three
  Triforces in your left hand symbolize power, wisdom and courage, these are
  the mark of the hero who is fated to appear when peace crumbles in Hyrule.
  With the Essences of Nature and Time and the courage you possess, you have
  fought back the powers of evil! The guidance of the Triforce has made you
  into this legendary hero! Thank you, Link." Then Zelda will kiss Link on the
  cheek, little hearts appear on top of Link's head. Then it shows a close-up
  of the Maku Tree, Din, Nayru, Zelda, Impa and Link. A screen that says
  "Legend of Zelda ~Oracle of Ages~" in big letters will appear. The credits
  will roll while it shows some of the characters and the animals Link found
  on his adventure. Then it will show Zelda on a balcony while she looks up
  into the sky and a falling star appears. It will then keep showing the 
  credits with a view of the castle in the background, the Triforce will appear
  and in the sky, they fade out and it shows an image of 3 seagulls, then it
  shows Link waving good bye from a small boat.
  Then it says "The End" while the boat sails into the sea. You get another
  password titled "Hero's Secret."

  2


 2)How to get them:

  Beat Onox on the first story.

  Beat Twinrova and Ganon on the second story.


 3)The ending from myself:

  First story:
  After you beat both of Onox's forms, he will start saying: "Grrrrgh....no...
  It's too late. My orders were to capture Din and deliver the destructive
  power of a seasonless land to Twinrova. Now, as the flame of destruction,
  that power is set to devour this land. Gah hah hah..." He then disappears 
  and a crystal starts to descend with Din inside, she is freed from the
  crystal and she says:
  "Thank you Link, I knew you could save me. Now that I am free again,
  the seasons should return to normal." Then it shows the season returning to
  normal in various parts of the game. Din talks again: "The trials you faced
  to collect the Essences of Nature have made you a true hero! A new trial
  shall call you away soon but we Oracles will watch over you in secret, in
  hope that darkness is kept from the hearts of mankind." The screen goes into
  a close-up of Din and Link and she says: "Let's return to Horon village and
  meet the others."
  You then realize you have been watched by Twinrova through their
  magic flame and they say: "Kya, ha, ha! Link! Don't think this is the end...
  Onox has fallen, but the damage he has done to this land burns on in the
  Flame of Destruction! When this flame lights the dark, our wish shall be
  granted, kya, ha, ha, ha!" It will show a close-up of Koume in the dark and
  the screen will change to "The Legend of Zelda ~Oracle of Seasons~" in
  big letters. The credits will roll while it shows Din and Link in the town,
  it will also show Maple flying near the Maku Tree and crashing in the nose
  bubble coming out the Tree. Then it shows another screen with Impa slapping
  Link in the face and some other stuff. It will then keep showing the credits
  with a view of the castle in the background, another still shot will show a
  sunset and a bunch of birds in the sky, then the game will give you a
  password to continue the game on the next game and it will say:
  "To be continued in....Oracle of Ages."

  Second story:
  After you beat Twinrova and Ganon, he will say: "Gwoh hoh hoh! I am Ganon...
  The evil king...." He disappears and you get to go up the stairs.
  You will find Zelda lying in the altar, get next to her and she will wake up
  and start talking to you: "...Link! Has it ended? Thank you, Link. You halted
  the completion of the rites that would have revived Ganon! Since they could
  not sacrifice me in their final rite, the powers of darkness could only
  revive a mindless, raging Ganon. Your power, wisdom and courage were able to
  prevent Twinrova's plan to resurrect Ganon. Now hope and peace can return to 
  the hearts of the people. Thank you! You are a true hero! Let us return to
  the others!
  The castle starts to crumble and Zelda says: "Oh no!!! The castle is
  crumbling now that the powers of shadow wane! We must get out of here!
  What do we do...? The leaves from the Maku Tree will start floating down
  and the Maku Tree will say:
  "You did it Link. I'm so proud!!! Leave this to me!" Zelda casts some
  spell that gets you both out of there. Then Zelda and you appear in front of
  the Maku Tree and it says: "See, Link? I have managed to help too."
  Nayru will get in front of Zelda and say: "Welcome back, Princess Zelda!
  Welcome back, Link! Now all is finished!" Then Din says:  "I knew you would
  find a way, Link! Let us dance together again!" Then Impa gets in front of
  Zelda and says: "Princess Zelda! I'm glad to see you return safely! Link! You
  are all I expected! I always believed in you!" Then Zelda speaks: "Link....
  The three Triforces in your left hand symbolize power, wisdom and courage,
  these are the mark of the hero who is fated to appear when peace crumbles in
  Hyrule. With the Essences of Nature and Time and the courage you possess, you
  have fought back the powers of evil! The guidance of the Triforce has made

  on the cheek, little hearts appear on top of Link's head. Then it shows a
  close-up of the Maku Tree, Din, Nayru, Zelda and Impa patting Link's head.
  A screen that says "Legend of Zelda ~Oracle of Seasons~" in big letters
  will appear. The credits will roll while it shows some of the characters
  and the animals Link found on his adventure. Then it will show Zelda on a
  balcony while she looks up into the sky and a falling star appears. It will
  then keep showing the credits with a view of the castle in the background,

  3


 2)How to get them:

  -The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past-
  In the Pyramid just beat Ganon.

  In The Palace of The Four Sword, beat the Link clones.

  -The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords-
  Just beat Vaati.


 3)The ending from myself & Alacarde:

  -The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past-
  In the Pyramid, just beat Ganon:
  After beating, Ganon the door will open and you will be in a room ready to
  receive the Triforce. Then The essence of the Triforce will say:
  "Welcome, Link...I am the essence of the Triforce. The Triforce will grant
  wishes in the heart and mind of the person who touches it. If a person
  with a good heart touches it, it will make his good wishes come true...
  If an Evil-hearted person touches it, it grants his evil wishes.
  Ganon's wish was to conquer the world. That wish changed the Golden Land
  to the Dark World. Ganon was building up his power here so he could
  conquer the Light World and make his wish come completely true.
  But now, you have totally destroyed Ganon. His dark world will vanish.
  The Triforce is waiting for a new owner, Its Golden Power is in your hands...
  Now touch it with a wish in your heart."
  Link then takes the Triforce. After that it will show various characters
  from the game like The King returning, your uncle recovering, the bully
  making a friend, the flute boy plays again, and such.
  Then it will show Link in the Lost Woods returning the Master Sword, a it 
  will say: "And the Master Sword sleeps again...FOREVER" as it shows the 
  Master Sword on its pedestal.
  The credits will roll, afterwards "The End" will appear, while showing the 
  number of times you died.

  In The Palace of The Four Sword beat the Link clones:
  After beating all 4 of Link clones, the four swords will start to circle the
  screen. It will then show scenes of the eight dungeons and the bosses.
  Then the scene changes to a shot of the Triforce rotating in the
  background while the game shows the stats of your game such as how many times
  you used each item in the game, how many enemies you killed, how many times
  you saved, etc. Then it shows each dungeon and then it will show each boss
  you encountered.


  -The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords-
  When you beat Vaati, he will scream and say: "Gwahhhhhhhh... I've been 
  felled by a bunch of young kids?! My b-body! My being! I'm being sucked into
  the Four Sword!"
  Zelda will drop down engulfed in light, and says: "Uhhhnnn... Oh! You saved
  me, didn't you? Thank you! But this time, something seems different... 
  Why!? Where are 4 of you! So the legend of the Four Sword was true!
  But how can we get you back to normal!?"
  The background goes white, the 4 Links rejoin into one. 
  Zelda says: "The Four Sword is the only blade that can contain the wind mage.
  Since you have fulfilled that destiny, the sword's power over you will fade.
  Now, let us return! And let us return the Four Sword to its shrine once
  again." 
  When the credits start rolling, the Links will be on a small platform, and
  fairies start flying at them. Hit them to get rupees (basically a Mini Game, 
  for one last Triforce Medal). When the credits stop rolling, the mini game 
  stops. It then shows Link and Zelda at the Four Sword shrine and the blade
  is placed on the pedestal.
  At the end of it, one of the Links will get a Triforce medal for the most
  rupees.

 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Vaati.


 3)The ending from mistereli:

  After defeating Vaati in his final form he says "Fool! I... But the light
  force... My power... I had such power..." then explodes.
  The mage's hat floats down and scene cuts back to the door to the sanctuary
  with Link and Zelda and the mage's hat.
  Zelda says "Link, thank goodness you're safe... you defeated Vaati... You
  were so brave! But we've lost so much... The castle... All those people..."
  The Minish Cap floats off of Link's head and returns to his original form and
  says "What's this? The curse... Defeating Vaati seems to have broken the
  curse he cast upon me! Allow me to introduce myself to you, Princess Zelda.
  My name is Elzo, master of Minish lore and sorcery. The mage's cap was my
  creation. But its limitless power has caused nothing but trouble for your
  kind. Is there any way you can forgive me? I know many have fallen, and
  much of the castle has been destroyed... But it is too soon to give into
  despair. The curse on me is broken, and Zelda still possesses some of
  the light force. 
  Perhaps, together, we can do something to make things right."
  Elzo floats the mage's cap onto Zelda's head and says "If one with a just
  heart wears this cap, things can be made right again. Princess Zelda! Let 
  your wishes be made real!" Princess Zelda and Elzo glow with magic and then
  the screen shows scenes of the castle and stone guards being returned to 
  normal. Then it shows all the monsters in the world disappearing and finally
  the sanctuary returning to normal. Zelda says "Look! The castle! All the 
  people who had been turned to stone! They're all back to normal!"
  Elzo says "hmm-hmm! The hat is falling apart. It's overflowing with the
  power of life! The hat has the power to turn the thoughts of its wearer into
  reality. Vaati's heart was filled with evil, and that was reflected in what
  he became. But it seems that Zelda's pure heart, coupled with the hat's 
  power... ... has created a miracle!"
  The sanctuary starts shaking Elzo says "Hmm... It looks like the time for us
  to part has come. The Minish Door opens but once every century, and soon,
  it must close. I must leave you both now and return to my homeland.
  I know I've caused you much suffering, but the evil one's power has been 
  withered. The power of Princess Zelda herself has returned the light to 
  Hyrule. Well, Link, my journey with you has been exciting, to say the least.
  In fact, I'm...more than just a little sad that we must part ways now."
  He waves his wand and a green hat appears above Link's head "Please, accept 
  this..." and the hat lands on Links head. Elzo says "Heh... You know, I've 
  never actually seen you wearing a cap until now! It suits you, little hero. 
  Take care..."
  Elzo shrinks to Minish size and walks toward the sanctuary but stops halfway
  and says "Farewell, my friend..." then enters the door. The credits roll.

 1)Number of endings:

 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Bellum.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After defeating the Phantom Knight, Bellum pops out of it and explodes in
  a stream of sand. Link looks to the right and gasps as he sees Tetra in
  a piece of ship wreckage. Tetra smiles and waves at Link. Link sighs with
  relief and waves back.
  Link then looks at the stream of sand, points the Phantom Sword upwards and
  absorbs all the sand, which clears the sky and turns it blue. Linebeck wakes
  up and says: "Yeesh. Ouch... What's going on here?! I thought..." 
  Ciela flies in, asking: "Are you OK? Linebeck! You were possessed by Bellum!"
  Linebeck drops to his knees saying: "WHAT?! Oh... That's right. I...uh...
  think... I remember something about Link..."
  Link walks towards Linebeck, he turns around and says: "Oh, kid, I mean...
  Link! I'm sorry! I know I was possessed by that monster... 
  But to think that I..." 
  Link smiles, and Ciela says: "Shush, Linebeck! If you hadn't stood up to 
  Bellum when you did... Who knows what might have happened to us!"
  Linebeck stands up: "Well... I guess I got caught up in the moment..."
  Ciela: "What?! That's not like you! Are you sure you're Linebeck?"
  Linebeck: "My ship just took a little... uh...damage..." Linebeck quickly 
  covers his mouth, and Ciela says: "Grandpa..."
  Link starts hearing whale sounds, Tetra and Linebeck walk towards Link while
  they look up to the sky trying to figure out where the sound is coming from.
  Link's sword starts to sparkle with electricity, a ball of sand shoots
  out of it towards the sky, and explodes. Sand starts to rain down on the 
  ocean, the place starts to shake, and a huge white whale jumps out of
  the ocean. When the whale comes back down, it splashes so much water that
  Linebeck is dragged back by the water, but Link is able to stand his ground.
  The white whale says: "Link... Linebeck... And Ciela... I have returned to 
  my true form... For that, I thank you."
  Linebeck, surprised, says: "WHAT?! WHOA! Old man, is that you?! 
  I never would've guessed you really looked like that!"
  Ocean King: "If not for you, I'd have been sealed up forever. This sea 
  would have fallen into desolation and evil. You saved me and the great sea.
  Thank you. Linebeck..."
  Linebeck: "What? Who? Me?"
  Ocean King: "I have to make good on a promise I made to you. I grant you 
  one wish."
  Ciela: "What is it? Come on! Say it! You want a treasure, don't you? 
  Just ask!"
  Linebeck: "No! That's not it at all! I don't need treasures  anymore!
  I think... If you insist... Can you bring back my ship? The one that sank?"
  Ciela: "What? That's it? You know, even if you ask for treasure later, 
  that's it!"
  Linebeck grabs Ciela by one of her wings, and says: "That's enough from you,
  Sparkles! You've always got to get the last word, don't you?"
  He then grabs her by her other wing and starts pulling on them.
  Ocean King: "The Sand of Hours is returned and peace reigns. The Ghost Ship 
  will no longer haunt your world."
  Tetra: "Our world? So what is the world that we are in now? 
  What is this place..."
  Suddenly, the place is encased by fog, and the Ocean King says: 
  "The time for you to return to your world is near..."
  Leaf comes out, saying: "The door to your world is about to open."
  Neri also comes out and says: "We are inhabitants of this world.
  We must return to the world of the Ocean King!
  Thanks, Link. And you too, Linebeck. Your courage will not be forgotten."
  They both fly away. Ciela, who is still being held by Linebeck, pries away
  from his hands and says: "Oh... Well, thank goodness, Linebeck!
  Now I don't have to look at you any longer. I was getting tired of seeing
  you all the time!"
  Linebeck: "Ugh! That's my line!" He turns his back to Ciela, and says: 
  "Get out of here, and good riddance!"
  Ciela slowly flies away saying: "Well... I'm leaving now... 
  ...Thanks, Linebeck."
  Linebeck turns around to look, but the fog has become much thicker and
  can barely see anything.
  Ciela flies to Link, saying: "I would like to stay with you, Link...
  But I'm a spirit. I serve the Ocean King. Now we have to say good-bye..."
  Link nods, and extends his hand. Ciela says: "Thanks, Link!" as she gets
  closer to Link's hand, and she disappears.
  The credits will roll while showing drawings of several characters, and
  events encountered throughout the game.
  Another scene will start. We see the camera looking up, and what looks like
  and old mast and sail with a Seagull flying around it. 
  Someone is heard saying: "...Oh. Hey!".
  We see a closeup of Link's face with his eyes wide open, the camera pans 
  back and we also see Tetra unconscious. The camera then shows that they
  are lying in the Ghost Ship. Link stands up and wakes Tetra up as Tetra's
  ship and crew sail next to them. Tetra is surprised and says: "...Huh?!
  Where are we..." as Niko waves and yells: "Boss!" from the ship.
  Tetra stands up, looks around the Ghost Ship and says: "Linebeck 
  disappeared... And the Ghost Ship is back... What's going on?"
  Tetra boards her ship and Nico says: "So you were OK all along?
  I was worried when I heard all that screaming... But you look fine!"
  Link starts to climb into Tetra's ship, Nico says to Tetra: "What about the
  Ghost Ship? Was there treasure aboard?"
  Tetra yells at Nico: "What are you talking about?!", which causes Link to
  comically slip and fall. Tetra continues: "I was almost frozen forever in
  that thing! Link saved me. You wouldn't believe what he went through!
  Do you understand what we've been through? Where were you? Did you even 
  look for us?"
  Mako walks into the scene, saying: "What are you talking about?
  You were only on that ship... It's only been about 10 minutes."
  Gonzo walks in and nods to Niko as Tetra barges in front of them saying:
  "Ten minutes?! You've got to be kidding! Do you know what we  have been
  through?!"
  Mako: "I have no idea what you're talking about. How could I? It was
  probably a bad dream." Gonzo lowers and shakes his head.
  Tetra: "You're not listening! It was longer than 10 minutes, 
  I'm telling you!"
  Link stands up, looks at where the Ghost Ship was and gasps, while Tetra
  yells: "That Ghost Ship is REALLY, REALLY DANGEROUS!"
  Gonzo looks and says: "...It's not there anymore..."
  Link and everyone looks in amazement at the ocean.
  Niko says: "The...the ship! It's gone! It really was cursed! The dream you
  had was the work of that Ghost Ship! Eeek!"
  Tetra turns to Niko and angrily says: "Hey! I told you it wasn't a dream!
  You guys never listen..."
  Link takes out the Phantom Hourglass, notices it's empty, runs to the other 
  side of the ship, and smiles as he sees Linebeck's ship sailing in the 
  distance.
  The camera pans to the sky, a Linebeck's ship horn is heard, and "The End"
  appears on the sky.

 1)Number of endings:

  1 + Variations


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Chancellor Cole, Puppet Zelda, and Malladus


 3)The ending from myself, and Banjo_2553:

  After Link and Zelda pierce Malladus' head with the sword, his gem breaks 
  and he'll start screaming in pain as Link and Zelda watch him get destroyed.
  Link and Zelda watch as the sky turns red, and she says: 
  "So it's all over now. But..."
  Link walks toward Zelda to comfort her, but he gasps as Anjean shows up.
  Anjean: "We were too late."
  Zelda walks towards Anjean, and says: "Oh, Anjean... I'm so sorry. Byrne 
  was trying to protect me..."
  Anjean: "Yes, but there should be no regrets. He wouldn't have had it
  any other way. Besides, our kind are the servants of the spirits.
  We don't disappear that easily."
  Anjean moves away from Link and Zelda, and starts casting some magic while
  Zelda asks: "What do you mean?"
  Anjean looks back at Zelda, a spirit light hovers next to her, and says: 
  "The spirit is persistent, my dear. Byrne may not have any memory of these 
  events, but years from now, he'll return in a new form.
  You see, as Lokomos... We weren't only meant to protect the Spirit Tracks.
  We were also meant to watch over mankind.
  But our protection is no longer needed. Even without the spirits' 
  guidance, you will do well. So I think I will return to the heavens...
  In the company of my old friend Byrne."
  Anjean and the spirit light ascend to the heavens as Zelda yells:
  "Anjean, wait!"
  Anjean stops and says: "Please watch over this land, my dear.
  And, Link... You must help her."
  Anjean then turns into spirit light too. As Zelda and Link watch, 
  Anjean says: "Good-bye... And thank you. Thank you both."
  Then it shows the spirits of all seven Lokomos going up to the heavens.
  Link and Zelda will hold hands, and the credits will roll.
  Several art screens will be shown as the credits play depicting characters
  encountered throughout the game. The final art screen will show Link 
  riding the train with spirit Zelda flying outside. The camera pans out
  showing that the image is in fact a picture in Zelda's work desk, as
  Zelda watches it in amusement.
  Now, before you fought Malladus, Zelda asked what you wanted to do when 
  this was all over. Depending on what you answered, the following scenes 
  will change.

  -Engineer-
  Zelda is at her desk, working and signing papers, when she hears a distant
  train whistle. She rushes to her window, and sees Link driving by. 
  She waves at him and giggles, then the camera pans up to the sky, 
  showing "The End". The train whistle goes off once again.

  -Warrior-
  Zelda is at her desk, working and signing papers, when she hears some
  swords clanking. She rushes to her window, and sees Link. She yells and 
  waves at Link, but it distracts him so that he gets hit. Zelda cringes a 
  little bit, then smiles, and half-heartedly waves. The camera pans up to
  the sky, showing "The End".

  -Dunno-
  Zelda is at her desk, working and signing papers. She looks toward the
  window for a moment, smiles, then continues working on some paperwork. 
  The camera pans out, through the window, and turns to face the sky 
  showing "The End."

 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Vaati.


 3)The ending from myself and Alacarde:

  When you beat Vaati, he will scream and say: "Gwahhhhhhhh... I've been 
  felled by a bunch of young kids?! My b-body! My being! I'm being sucked into
  the Four Sword!"
  Zelda will drop down engulfed in light, and says: "Uhhhnnn... Oh! You saved
  me, didn't you? Thank you! But this time, something seems different... 
  Why!? Where are 4 of you! So the legend of the Four Sword was true!
  But how can we get you back to normal!?"
  The background goes white, the 4 Links rejoin into one. 
  Zelda says: "The Four Sword is the only blade that can contain the wind mage.
  Since you have fulfilled that destiny, the sword's power over you will fade.
  Now, let us return! And let us return the Four Sword to its shrine once
  again." 
  When the credits start rolling, the Links will be on a small platform, and
  fairies start flying at them. Hit them to get rupees (basically a Mini Game,
  for one last Triforce Medal). When the credits stop rolling, the mini game 
  stops. It then shows Link and Zelda at the Four Sword shrine and the blade
  is placed on the pedestal.
  At the end of it, one of the Links will get a Triforce medal for the most 
  rupees.

 1)Number of endings:

  1


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Ganon.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After you beat Ganon, Princess Zelda will start to use her magic
  to keep Ganon on the ground and says: "I'm using my power to hold the
  evil king! You use your sword and deliver the final blow."
  Her magic will fade and Link's Master Sword will start shining, Link then
  will slash Ganon twice and then it will stab him in the head.
  Ganon will stand up trashing about and Zelda will say: "Six sages... Now!"
  She will then invoke her magic and kneel down tired. Screen will change
  to the Chamber of Sages and Rauru will appear and say: "Ancient creators
  of Hyrule! Now, open the sealed door and send the Evil Incarnation of 
  Darkness into the void of the Evil Realm!!" He will start to invoke the
  magic, then Darunia appears and invokes also, then Ruto, then Nabooru, then
  Impa and Lastly Saria, then each of them will turn into a different set of
  magic ball and they shoot out into the center of the Chamber of Sages,
  creating a void. Ganon gets sucked in and he says: "YOU... CURSE YOU...ZELDA!
  CURSE YOU...SAGES!!"
  He appears on screen floating in the emptiness of the void and continues to
  say: "CURSE YOU...Link! Someday... When this seal is broken... That's when I
  will exterminate your descendants!!" With that he disappears and says: "As
  long as the Triforce of Power is in my hand..." Then Zelda and Link are shown
  "standing" in the sky and Zelda says: "Thank you, Link.... Thanks to you,
  Ganondorf has been sealed inside the Evil Realm! Thus, peace will once again
  reign in this world... for a time. All the tragedy that has befallen Hyrule
  was my doing... I was so young... I could not comprehend the consequences of
  trying to control the Sacred Realm. I dragged you into it, too. Now it is
  time for me to make up for my mistakes... You must lay the Master Sword to
  rest and close the Door of Time... However, by doing this, the road between 
  times will be closed..." Zelda extends her hand to Link and says: 
  "Link, give the Ocarina to me. As a Sage, I can return you to your original
  time with it."
  Link looks at the Ocarina and puts it in Zelda's hand, then Zelda puts her 
  other hand on top of Link's hand and looks at it with sad eyes. 
  Then Zelda says: " When peace returns to Hyrule... It will be time for us to
  say Good-bye... Now, go home, Link. Regain your lost time! Home... where you
  are supposed to be... the way you are supposed to be..." Zelda then plays the
  Ocarina and a blue light engulfs Link, and Zelda says: "Thank you... Link...
  Good-bye..." The credits will roll while it shows various sceneries from the
  game, such as Gerudo Valley, the Gerudo Fortress, Kakariko Town, 
  Death Mountain, Goron City, Lake Hylia, among others. After that they will
  show all the characters from the game, Gorons, Zoras, the people from the
  town, Epona, Malon, Talon, etc, having a party with a big fire with multiple
  colors at Lon Lon Ranch. Then it shows Mido sitting down next to the
  Zora King, he is sort of worried, he sees some sparkles falling down from the
  sky, he gets up and starts to look at 5 colored light spheres flying in the
  sky. Next screen shows the light spheres flying through Death Mountain and
  there it shows Impa, Ruto, Nabooru and Darunia with Saria on top of his head.
  Then the scene goes inside the Time Temple and and it shows the Master Sword
  and Link in front of it, Link is back to his child self again. Then Navi
  flies to the top of the Time Temple and leaves through a window, Link walks
  away and the camera does a close up on the Master Sword and it will show
  "Presented by Nintendo" Then it will show Zelda peeking through a window 
  inside Hyrule Castle and Link is  walking towards her, she turns her head
  and looks at Link, they both stand there looking at each other, just like the
  first time they met. The screen will freeze and change its colors to a light
  brown. Now you will see the credits for the 3D version while screens of
  scenes from the game appear on the left.

1)Number of endings:

  2


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Majora, with or without getting all the masks.


 3)The ending from the World of Nintendo:

  After you beat Majora's Wrath, it will show the four giants outside
  Clock Town trying to stop the moon. The moon gets destroyed and turns into
  a rainbow of debris. Everyone is standing around cheering. The screen turns
  white as itt says: "DAWN OF A NEW DAY."
  Link wakes up as Tatl and Tael are floating in front of him.
  They say: "Aah! He's awake!" Link sits up, with his horse behind him. 
  The camera looks at the four giants who are looking at Link. Then it pans
  down at the Skull Kid, who is not wearing the Majora's Mask. 
  He says: "You guys... You hadn't forgotten about me?"
  The giants make a noise. Skull Kid says: "You still thought of me as a
  friend?" The fairies fly over to the Skull Kid as the giants walk away.
  The Skull Kid says: "Did you... Did you save me? I thought they didn't want
  to be friends with me... But... they hadn't forgotten about me... Friends 
  are a nice thing to have... Heh, heh. Could you be my friend, too?" He walks
  up to Link and sniffs him. Then he says: "Eh-Hee-Hee...You have the same 
  smell as the fairy kid who taught me that song in the woods... 
  I know, I know! Let's do something." Out of nowhere the Mask Man appears
  holding the Majora's Mask and he says: "Oh...So the evil has left the mask
  after all... Well, now... I finally have it back. Since I am in the midst of
  my travels... I must bid you Farewell. Shouldn't you be returning home as
  well? Whenever there is a meeting. A parting sure to follow. However that
  parting need not last forever. Whether a parting last forever or merely for 
  a short time... that is up to you. With that, please excuse me..."
  He turns around and walks away. He stops looks back and says: "But my, you
  sure have managed to make quite a number of people happy. The masks you have
  are filled with happiness. This is truly a good happiness." He disappears.
  Tatl says: "Well, both of us have gotten what we were after... so this is
  where you and I part ways, isn't it? You know... it was kind of fun. Well
  it's almost time for the carnival to begin... So, why don't you just leave
  and go about your business? The rest of us have a carnival to go to."
  Link nods his head jumps on his horse and gallops away.
  As he gallops away, Talt yells: "Link! ....Thank you!"
  The credits will roll as they show various characters and scenes from the 
  game, they start in front of Clocktown, a bunch of fireworks start going 
  off inside Clocktown. Then it shows the Indigo Band playing a song.
  Then the Great Bay, the Pirates Fortress, Ikana canyon, the Deku King
  Princess and the monkey, etc.
  From here on, depending if you found a mask or not, you will either get
  a scene or just see a rotating 3D model of the mask you missed in a black 
  background (thanks Steven Cole).
  You'll see the Postman running, then in the Milk Bar the girls are dancing
  the dance you taught them, then you'll see the big fairies, then it shows 
  Cremia teaching Romani to shoot arrows on the ranch. Then the elderly couple
  in Clock Town. Then Grog and the chickens on Romani Ranch. Then it goes back
  to the milk bar and the Indy Go Gos are playing. Then it shows the father
  holding Pamela in Ikana Canyon. Then Kafei and Anju's wedding, with Tingle
  floating around. Then it shows the small sad Deku Tree you saw at the start
  with the Deku Butler in front of it looking at each other.
  The screen turns black and it shows you riding Epona in the Lost Woods. 
  Then it zooms in on a tree stump that has a drawing of Link, Skull kid and 
  the 4 giants on it. It plays a little bit of the song from the Lost Woods,
  and "The End" appears at the bottom. Then you will get the credits for the
  3D version.

           --------------------------------------------------------

 1)Number of endings:

  1 + Extra Scene


 2)How to get it:

  Just beat Yuga.


 3)The ending from myself:

  After beating Yuga Ganon, Hilda will appear unconscious on the floor. If you
  try talking to her, she'll groan in pain. Approach Zelda's painting on the 
  wall and Zelda will be freed from the curse. She looks at Link, laughs, 
  and then gasps when Hilda barely stands up. 
  Hilda says: "Wh-what more can I do...?"
  Zelda: "So it was you who had me imprisoned in that painting, 
  Princess Hilda?"
  Hilda: "Obviously."
  Link draws his sword, and Zelda says: "Please, Princess Hilda... 
  No one understands the sacred duty a princess has to her people more than I, 
  but you can't- "
  Hilda: "You understand nothing! Your kingdom has been under the protection 
  of your Triforce..."
  Zelda: "But that's...!"
  Hilda: "This isn't over! I must have it!" 
  Hilda starts to slowly limp towards Zelda, and Ravio is heard yelling: 
  "Please! This has to stop!" Ravio crashes into the room, dropping a few 
  Rupees. Ravio removes his mask, Zelda and Link gasp, and it's revealed Ravio
  is Lorule's version of Link.
  Zelda says: "Who-?"
  Ravio: "Well, funny story there. Your hero and I have gotten to know each 
  other pretty well. But not long ago, I served Princess Hilda here in Lorule.
  So, begging your pardon, Princess Zelda, but would you mind if I intervene 
  here?"
  Ravio turns to Hilda and says: "Your Royal Highness."
  Hilda: "You vanish on me and now come crawling back? Why?"
  Ravio: "Forgive me, Your Highness. I'm a coward at heart. There was no way
  that I had the courage to stand up to you and Yuga.
  But I was smart enough to go to Hyrule. I knew they'd have a hero who could
  help me."
  Hilda: "Another betrayal?! This hero has proven useful to me, but you-!
  You wanted him to defeat me?"
  Ravio: "I-I'm sorry, my princess. But it was with the best of intentions.
  I wish the best for our kingdom. But by ruining Hyrule...? You'd bring out the
  absolute worst in Lorule."
  Hilda: "You'd rather see Lorule crumble?!"
  Ravio: "No, no... Of course not, Princess. But there must be some other way."
  Hilda: "No..."
  Ravio: "Don't you realize? The reason your noble ancestors destroyed our
  Triforce... was to STOP such chaos!"
  Hilda: "That's not what I...!"
  Ravio: "Look around you... This is EXACTLY what happened with our 
  Triforce...!"
  Hilda gasps and says: "Oh, no..."
  Ravio: "Princess Hilda, I... I just wanted to save you from all this- you, 
  who've worried endlessly about the fate of Lorule.
  Please, Princess Hilda, let's do the right thing. Lorule may be doomed, 
  but at least our kingdom won't be condemned for stealing their Triforce."
  Hilda: "You're right. Princess Zelda, I have been led astray, tempted by the 
  power of your Triforce. But I swear... I did it for my people."
  Zelda: "Please, Princess Hilda, there is no need to-"
  Hilda: "No, please, let me finish. You are so fortunate to have a hero like
  Link. What courage he has displayed! That alone proves that Hyrule deserves 
  its Triforce. Now I will ensure that you leave this dark kingdom of mine 
  safely- and with your Triforce. Please, follow me. I know of a way that you
  can go home."
  The scene changes, and we see a big dark slate with an upside-down Triforce, 
  and a big crack with light escaping from it.
  Hilda says: "Welcome to Lorule's Sacred Realm...
  Yuga discovered that there was a strange crack in this grim slate...
  Through it, we could sense that there was another world beyond ours... 
  a place where the Triforce still existed. He and I devised the scheme that 
  imperiled your kingdom. But I alone will set this right."
  Hilda walks towards Link and says: "Please now, if you will give me your 
  bracelet, Link."
  Link hands her the bracelet, then Hilda walks towards the slate and says:
  "I should be able to use the last of its power to send the both of you home
  to Hyrule." The bracelet's power starts to emanate.
  Ravio shakes Link's hand and says: "It's been a pleasure, my friend. I got
  to meet a real, live, genuine hero. Ha! Who knows? Maybe some of your
  courage rubbed off on me. So thanks, Link."
  The bracelet's power emanates stronger and turns Zelda and Link into paintings
  which get dragged into the slate's crack. Then, the light emanating from the
  crack disappears. Ravio and Hilda stare at the slate, and the bracelet 
  disintegrates. Then we see Lorule's Castle from far away, which is still 
  decayed and drab.
  Scene changes to Zelda and Link, on a foggy Hyrule's Sacred Realm. 
  Link is unconscious on the floor, and Zelda says: "Can you hear me? Please, 
  open your eyes, Link..."
  Link wakes up and Zelda says: "Oh, I'm so glad you're all right! 
  And look, Link!"
  The fog clears up and we see the Triforce. 
  Zelda: "How wonderful... We're back home! You know, I've never seen the 
  Triforce whole. Let's go take a closer look, Link!"
  If, instead of going towards the Triforce, you try to exit the Sacred Realm, 
  Zelda will say: "Come on, Link. The Trifoce."
  If you talk to Zelda before you get to the Triforce, she'll say: "How rare to 
  visit our Sacred Realm! I'm so very grateful for all that you've done, Link."
  Once you get to the Triforce, Zelda says: "How terribly sad for Princess 
  Hilda... to be driven to such desperation! Her kingdom was in such a sorry 
  state. She and I aren't as different as she thought. I really do understand 
  why she needed our Triforce.
  Thanks to your heroic efforts, our Triforce and Hyrule itself have been made 
  whole again. There is just one thing left to do, Link.
  You restored the Triforce. Now, just reach out and touch it. Whatever your 
  wish, it will be granted. Yet, after all that we've seen, do we not share the
  same wish?"
  If, before touching the Triforce, you talk to Zelda, she'll say: "Let's make
  the wish together, Link."
  Now, when you approach the Triforce, Zelda will nod to Link, they will both
  touch it and light will beam out of the Triforce. The Triforce will float to
  the sky and shine very bright. 
  The scene will change to Hilda and Ravio at Lorule's Sacred Realm, everything
  will be shaking, and light beams out of the slate's crack, destroying the 
  slate in the process.
  The shaking stops, Hilda and Ravio look up and see Lorule's upside-down
  Triforce regenerating again. Hilda gasps and the Triforce shines it's light,
  whle Hilda cries. We see a zoomed out Lorule Castle, light shines from the 
  sky lifting the darkness, and Hilda says: "Thank you, Princess Zelda... 
  Oh, thank you... And to you as well, Hero of Hyrule... Thank you, Link!"
  The credits will roll, showing several scenes. First we see Gulley's painting,
  and it then switches to showing the blacksmith, his wife, and Gulley in the
  secluded grove surrounded by birds and squirrels.
  Next is the Seres painting, then it switches to the Sanctuary where we see
  the Priest, Seres, Dampe, and the Captain- who got his sword back.
  Next is Osfala's painting, and his scene shows Sahasrahla in his house, 
  his wife comes to berate at Osfala, then she starts crying.
  Next is Irene's painting, her scenes show the Witch teaching her how to
  make a potion, which then proceeds to explode in Irene's face.
  Next is Oren's painting, in her scenes we see the Zora guards dancing in front
  of the queen in Zora's Domain.
  Then it's Rosso's painting, his scenes show him carrying two rocks in Death </pre><pre id="faqspan-4">
  Mountain, while the Bouldering Guy is unable to lift one.
  Next, Impa's painting is shown, and her scene has her walking at Hyrule's 
  Castle next to a line of guards, one of them is falling asleep and Impa yells
  at him to wake up.
  The credits continue, now it shows a painting of Hyrule Castle with the 
  Triforce shining in the air. Then, several scenes will be shown: the Milk Bar,
  where all the townspeople have gathered to listen to the musicians; Next, the
  Cucco Girl and her children at the Cucco Ranch; then the StreetPass old man
  at the village; and then Mother Maiamai waving goodbye.
  Finally, Zelda's painting will appear, and it shows her and Link in Hyrule 
  Castle standing in front of the painting depicting the Link and Zelda from 
  A Link to the Past.
  The credits will end, and we see Link returning the Master Sword to its 
  resting place. Now, depending if you finished the normal game, or Hero mode, 
  the following scenes will play out differently.
  In the normal game, Link will leave the pedestal, and several small animals 
  will come out to admire the Master Sword. "The End" will appear on the screen.
  In Hero Mode, Link walks down the pedestal, Zelda and the seven sages will be
  there, and "The End" will appear on the screen.
  After that, the game will show how many Rupees you collected and how many
  times you died. Then you'll get the following message in you finished the 
  normal mode:
  "Congratulations on completing the game! You can select Hero Mode when you

  -Legend Mode-
  After dealing the last blow to Ganon, a cutscene will start showing him
  stumbling and then falling as Link, Zelda, and Lana watch. The Triforce
  escapes Ganon, separates itself and each character grabs one piece of it,
  then they band their hands together to combine it into the Triforce again.
  Ganon starts to wake up and the Triforce shoots a beam of light into 
  Ganon's chest, destroying him completely.
  Link, Zelda, and Lana turn back and see Impa, who is looking at the spirits 
  of Darunia, Ruto, Midna, Fi, and Agitha waving good bye. 
  The spirits disappear and Lana says: "There's just one thing left...
  Return the Master Sword to its place. But I'm not the one who should do that.
  No matter what, you two always save Hyrule... together."
  Link and Zelda nod to each other, and leave. Lana takes one last look and
  says: "Good-bye, Link..." 
  The scene changes to Link and Zelda standing in front of a shadow-covered
  pedestal. Zelda says: "Ready?" and Link nods. Link takes out the 
  Master Sword and cleaves it into the pedestal, but the shadow is too 
  strong and Link is barely able to hold on. Zelda runs towards Link and 
  helps him push the sword, finally, the shadow subsides and the Master Sword
  is placed on the pedestal once again. Link and Zelda look at each other and
  nod as a gate from Temple of the Sacred Sword opens behind them. They go in,
  and the gate closes.
  The credits will roll showing portraits, and cutscenes of all the characters.
  Then, a fairy will appear and the word "Fin" will materialize on the screen.
  After that, you'll get the results screen.

  -Adventure Mode-
  After dealing the last blow to Ganon, a cutscene will start showing him
  screaming in pain, and then being destroyed.
  The screen will go white and a message appears: "Thanks Link, you're the 
  hero of Hyrule."
  The credits will roll, showing artwork of enemies and characters from the
  game, while 8-bit sprites and maps from Legend of Zelda 1 are shown in
  the background.
  After the credits are over, an 8-bit version of Link will walk into the 
  screen, a message will say: "Finally, peace returns to Hyrule." 
  All of the main characters walk into the screen too in their 8-bit forms,

 3)The ending from myself:

  -Bad Ending-
  After beating Uncle Rupee, the screen goes white, and Pinkle will say:
  "Hey Tingle! It's me! Pinkle! Congratulations! I knew you could do it!
  I never doubted you, Tingle! The world is at peace and the Grand Fairy 
  and her friends are happy! ... It's just... I feel a little lonely...
  Tingle, for you and me, this is goodbye... I should be happy that we
  can go back to our normal lives but...
  ...Anyway... I think it's time for me to go... I will miss you, Tingle.
  Just once I wanted to... ...well, never mind....  
  .... ... Farewell... Tingle..."
  Tingle and a ton of rupees start to fall from space towards Earth.
  We then see Port Town and its inhabitants frantically trying to catch
  the rupees falling from the sky while Tingle is seen engulfed in flames
  crashing down. Tingle then stands up and starts jumping around, as 
  several characters start talking.  
  Dave: "A rain of rupees is falling! The grown-ups are going crazy!"
  Aba: "I don't want to end up like they are!"
  Big Bro: "You can say that again!"
  Missy: "It's like some sort of Rupee Paradise!"
  Chiko: "The grown-ups' faces look scary! Like they're possessed!"
  The screen dims and an apparition of a laughing Uncle Rupee is shown.
  Then the next scene shows the tower rising with Tingle on top, we see the
  credits etched on the tower. Tingle's Uncle flies by, and Barkle runs around
  in the ground. Once the tower stops rising, "The End?" appears at the base
  of it.
  
  -Good Ending-
  After beating Uncle Rupee, it shows Tingle on the top screen as a regular
  man, while on the bottom one a message reads: "Tingle... The evil Uncle
  Rupee only used rupees to satisfy his greed... ...but he was utterly 
  destroyed by the rupees' positive power! Now it is time for you to gather
  the rupees you have earned on this adventure... ...and for you to use 
  them the right way, for the good of the world... I know you'll do the 
  right thing!"
  On the top screen we see Tingle getting happier and happier while the 
  screen glitters.
  Then it shows Tingle inside a mansion, sitting in a couch with a tiger-skin
  carpet. He has a dog next to him and everything glitters. 
  On the bottom screen a message reads: "What?! Do nothing all day?!"  
  Then it shows him in a banquet table eating burgers, pizza, fries, etc.
  Another message says: "Eat everything you want?!"
  Then we see him in a resort, sunbathing next to a pool with girls. 
  The message says: "Go on holiday and never work again..."
  Then we see him rolling down the window of a limousine, while accompanied
  by a 	girl. The message says: "Go out every night with your girlfriend?
  (Sorry, girlfriends?!)"
  Finally, we see Tingle in a sea of rupees, as he plays with them.
  The message says: "Tingle! Are you no better than Uncle Rupee?!"
  Then the next scene shows the tower rising with Tingle on top, we see the
  credits etched on the tower. Tingle's Uncle flies by, and Barkle runs around
  in the ground. Once the tower stops rising, "The End" appears at the base
  of it.

  -Legend Mode-
  After beating Phantom Ganon, a cutscene will show him being destroyed,
  and a piece of the Triforce coming out of him. 
  Lana then runs towards Cia, who is unconscious on the floor. She grabs Cia,
  who wakes up as the Triforce piece drops down towards them. Lana encloses
  the Triforce piece into an energy ball, and Cia grabs it. 
  Tetra, King Daphnes, and Link stand there watching, and King Daphnes says:
  "The land is at peace. Light has shone brightly upon us all."
  Lana and Cia walk towards the characters, Tetra says: "Here's hoping we
  run into each other again someday." as she waves good bye.  
  Tetra and King Daphnes disappear, as Link waves them good bye.
  Lana looks at Cia and says: "We should go. Time to repair things, just
  like we always do."
  Link, Lana, and Cia walk outside, meeting Zelda, and Impa. 
  Link, Zelda, and Cia band their hands together, the Triforce pieces
  become one as it shoots up to the sky, and shines a bright light over
  the land destroying all evil.
  The Triforce breaks back into the three pieces and goes back into the 
  characters' hands. The characters look at each other, and smile.
  Lana, and Cia walk away, and Lana turns to wave good bye. Link and Zelda
  wave good bye as well, while Impa watches on. The camera then pans to 
  the sky as doves fly by.
  Afterwards, the credits will roll while showing portraits, and cutscenes 
  of all the characters. Then, a fairy will appear and the word "Fin" 
  will materialize on the screen.
  An additional scene will play showing a scroll unfolding, the Triforce
  appears in the scroll, and the narrator will say: "In this way, peace
  returned to Hyrule."
  Drawings of Lana and Cia as guardians appear on the scroll, while the
  narrator says: "Lana and Cia bid Link and the others farewell and resumed
  their roles as guardians in the Valley of Seers."
  The Triforce takes center stage on the scroll, drawings of Lana and Cia,
  Zelda, and Link appear on the screen as the narrator says: "Power... 
  Wisdom... Courage." Only Link is now shown, as the narrator says: 
  "Together, Lana and Cia would protect the balance of the Triforce--in peace
  and harmony." After that, you'll get the results screen.
  
  -Adventure Mode-
  After dealing the last blow to Ganon, a cutscene will start showing him
  screaming in pain, and then being destroyed.
  The screen will go white and a message appears: "Thanks Link, you're the 
  hero of Hyrule."
  The credits will roll, showing artwork of enemies and characters from the
  game, while 8-bit sprites and maps from Legend of Zelda 1 are shown in
  the background.

  screen, a message will say: "Finally, peace returns to Hyrule." 
  All of the main characters walk into the screen too in their 8-bit forms, 
  and another message will say: "This ends the story", while the characters

  standing beside Zelda on a small platform, surrounded by grass and flowers.
  You are then returned to a screen with the narrator looking out of a tower 
  window, while delivering the ending monologue: "Princes Zelda, you’ve
  succeeded. Your victory has brought peace and light back to Tolemac. 
  Your courage and strength will not be forgotten. For now, your work is done.
  Off you go and celebrate Link's return, but first, remember, lessons of the 
  heart, mercy and human kindness prevail above all else. 
  Farewell young princess!"
  This is followed by a "The End" screen, and then the credits start to roll.
