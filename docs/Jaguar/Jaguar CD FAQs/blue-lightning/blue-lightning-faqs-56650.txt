I.  Introduction

This is a FAQ/Walkthrough for the Jaguar CD game Blue Lightning.  It contains
a list of controls, a complete walkthrough, and a mini-review.  Please note
that the walkthrough does contain spoilers.

*******************************************************************************
II.  Background Story 

Here is the background story from the instruction booklet:

General Drako was one of the greatest military minds to ever work for the 
United Nations.  Not that anyone knew; the peacekeeping forces supplied by
countries around the world were a well-kept secret, to be used only when global
peace was threatened by radicals and tyrants.  Drako slowly and subversively
gained control of most of these forces, corrupting them to his own will.  Even
some of the pilots of the venerated Blue Lightning Squadron turned to Drako in
exchange for promises of wealth and power.  By the time Drako's betrayal was
discovered, his crime net stretched across the globe.
 
The U.N. leaders were shocked.  Something had to be done, and soon, before the
rest of the world found out the hard way that something had gone wrong.  The
forces that remained with the U.N. were eager to stop Drako from achieving his
horrible goals.  But they would need support from the air: from Blue Lightning
Squadron.

This is where you come in.  As a rookie pilot, you will test your skills in
four training missions.  Then you'll choose your first Tour of Duty.  Each
Tour has four challenging missions that you must get through using your weapons
and your skill to stop Drako's forces from accomplishing their criminal tasks.
Do well, and you will be given access to additional aircraft with unique
abilities.  There are specific goals you must accomplish in order for the
missions to succeed.  Good luck!  A lot of people are counting on you for their
survival!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Game Screen

Score

Your current score is displayed in the upper left of the screen.

Damage Meter

The meter on the left side of the screen is your damage meter.  It starts out
green and turns red as you take damage, once it's completely red, your plane
is destroyed.  The length of the damage meter is determined by your planes
armor rating.

Missiles

Your remaining missiles are displayed in the upper right of the screen.  A
large missile represents ten missiles and a small missile represents one.

Special Weapons

Your remaining special weapons are displayed below the missiles.

Progress Bar

The meter on the right is your progress bar, it shows how far through the
stage you are.  It starts out yellow and turns black, once it's completely
black, you'll exit the stage and head home.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Basic Strategies

-  Plane choice is crucial in this game.
-  The F-14 and MiG-29 are the best planes for air missions.
-  The A-10 and Tornado are the best planes for ground missions.
-  Performing a barrel roll makes it easier to dodge enemy fire, but you will
   be unable to steer or fire while rolling.
-  City missions are the toughest in the game, fortunately there are only
   four (one in Training and three in Europe).
-  The majority of missions in the game are ground missions, so make sure
   you protect your A-10.  If you crash it, go ahead and reset the game.
-  Europe is the toughest of the main seven tours, before tackling it be
   absolutely sure you have the A-10 and F-14 available.

*******************************************************************************
V.  Planes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Overview

Once you complete training in the simulator, you will be given access to the
"real" planes.  You start off with three in the hangar.  You will earn an
extra plane after scoring 50,000 points.  Afterwards, you'll earn a new plane
after every 100,000 points.  Planes are unlocked in the order listed in this
FAQ.  After you've unlocked the last plane, you can earn back any crashed
planes (in the same order).  If you already have all seven planes, any earned
planes will be "banked", if you crash a plane, it will automatically be
replaced.

Each plane has five different stats:

Speed obviously determines how fast your plane flies.  Stealth determines how
well an enemy can locate you.  Armor affects the length of your damage meter,
the higher the stat, the longer the meter.  Avionics controls your missiles,
a higher rating means that your missiles can fly farther and will be more 
accurate.  Each plane has a maximum number of missiles, for ground missions, 
you can swap some missiles in exchange for special anti-ground ordinance.  You
give up two missiles for every one special ordinance you carry.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  F-18 Hornet

Speed:     Medium
Stealth:   Good
Armor:     Light
Avionics:  Good
Missiles:  30

The F-18 Hornet is the first plane you get to fly in Blue Lightning, it is the
only one available during Training.  In my opinion, the F-18 is the worst
plane in the game 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  MiG-29 Fulcrum

Speed:     High  
Stealth:   Good 
Armor:     Fair 
Avionics:  Good
Missiles:  30 

The MiG-29 is one of the three planes available when you begin the seven main
tours.  It is an excellent choice for air attack missions, second only to the
F-14.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  AJ-37 Viggen

Speed:     Medium 
Stealth:   Fair
Armor:     Medium 
Avionics:  Fair
Missiles:  26  

The AJ-37 Viggen is one of the worst planes in the game.  It does have the
best armor rating of the three starting planes, making it a good choice for
ground missions - if the A-10, Tornado, and Harrier aren't available ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  A-10 Thunderbolt II

Speed:     Low 
Stealth:   Ground 
Armor:     Best 
Avionics:  Poor
Missiles:  32

The A-10 Thunderbolt is a beast, easily the best plane in the game!  It's
sky high armor rating means an extra long life meter and it is capable of
carrying six special weapons.  The A-10 also has the most powerful gun in the
game.  The downside is that you are required to take a special weapon on ground
missions.  The A-10 is the best choice for ground missions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  F-14A Tomcat

Speed:     High
Stealth:   Fair
Armor:     Heavy
Avionics:  Best
Missiles:  32  

The F-14A Tomcat is the best plane available for air attack missions - period.
The F-14 is not so great for ground missions and CANNOT carry napalm or cluster
bombs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.  AV-8B Harrier II

Speed:     Hover 
Stealth:   Fair 
Armor:     Heavy 
Avionics:  Fair
Missiles:  20  

The AV-8B Harrier is more of a novelty than anything else.  Activating the
airbrake will cause the Harrier to hover in place.  This isn't that useful in
practice, all it really does is make you a stationary target for enemy forces!
The Harrier does have a high armor rating, making it a good substitute for
ground missions if the A-10 and Tornado aren't available.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.  Tornado GR.1

Speed:     High 
Stealth:   Fair 
Armor:     Heavy 
Avionics:  Fair
Missiles:  40 

The Tornado is the last plane you'll unlock.  It can carry more missiles than
any other plane and like the A-10 can carry six special weapons.  It also has
a great armor rating making it a great choice for ground missions if you have
crashed your A-10.

*******************************************************************************
VI.  Weapons

Guns

Every plane is equipped with a gun with unlimited ammo.  Guns are great against
ground targets, but not as effective on air targets.  The A-10's gun is more
powerful than the other planes'.

Missiles

Every plane can carry a limited number of missiles.  Missiles can be used
against either air or ground targets.  The range and accuracy of your missiles
depends on your plane's avionics rating.

Cluster Bombs

Cluster bombs are special weapons available during ground missions.  When
deployed the explosion covers a wide area and is good for attacking clusters
of enemies.  The F-14 cannot carry cluster bombs.

Napalm

Napalm is a special weapon available during ground missions.  Napalm is
deployed in a line behind the plane, making it ideal for taking out a column
of enemies on the ground.  The F-14 cannot carry napalm.

SLAMR Bombs

SLAMRs are special armor piercing bombs available during certain ground
missions.  SLAMRs are used for taking out large, high priority targets.  All
planes are capable of carrying SLAMRs.

Description:

Drako's forces are pulling out, and taking their profits with them.  You must
not let any of them escape.

Tips:

-  I recommend using the Tornado and carrying cluster bombs.
-  About half way through the mission, an enemy ace will attack.  The easiest
   way to deal with him is to hit the afterburners and try to make him crash
   into a rock formation.

H.  Europe

Drako has built up a major residential and business center in Europe to
coordinate his crime syndicate.  We must shut down this criminal metropolis,
but it will require top flying skills to avoid buildings and gunfire.

Europe is one of the most difficult tours, mainly due to its whopping THREE
city missions!  I recommend completing it as soon as you can.  The A-10 is an
absolute MUST for this tour.

Mission:  Scenic Route
Type:     Air Escort

Description:

A high altitude recon plane will fly over and take spy photos of the city
center.  Protect the plane while it finds a weakness in the city layout.

Tips:

-  I recommend using either the MiG-29 or the F-14 if available.
-  Stay as close to the spy plane as possible.
-  If you lose sight of the plane, a red arrow will appear to direct you.
-  Be careful when using your gun, your shots will damage the spy plane!

...............................................................................
Mission:  Clear Out
Type:     Ground Attack

Description:

Before you can strike at the city's core, you must clear out their perimeter
defenses.  Watch out for tall buildings and use napalm to clear the streets of
enemy vehicles.

Tips:

-  I recommend using the A-10 and carrying napalm.
-  As soon as the stage begins, activate your air brake!
-  Use your guns on the ground targets.
-  Use your missiles to take out the helicopters.
-  Use napalm on the truck columns.

...............................................................................
Mission:  Diversion
Type:     Ground Attack

Description:

We have found a weakness in the city core defense grids, but it is too heavily
guarded to attack directly.  You must create a diversion by attacking supplies
downtown.

Tips:

-  I recommend using the A-10 and carrying napalm.
-  As soon as the stage begins, activate your airbrake.
-  Be very careful when flying through the arches!

...............................................................................
Mission:  Switch Off
Type:     Ground Attack

Description:

The enemy has been distracted.  Now you can attack the main target - a power
station that controls the whole city.  Attack the power dome with SLAMR bombs.
Good luck - you're gonna need it.

-  I recommend using the A-10.
-  As soon as the stage begins, activate your airbrake.
-  DO NOT USE YOUR SLAMRS ON ANYTHING BESIDES THE TARGET!
-  Target looks like the Epcot Center "golfball".
-  When you see the diamond lock, quickly drop as many SLAMRs as you can.
-  If you don't destroy the target the first time around, you are given another
   chance.
-  If you run out of SLAMRs, you can use missiles, but your guns won't work!

Description:

You should have a clear path to the thermal intensifier.  Destroy the array of
solar panels before Drako puts them to use.

Tips:

-  The A-10 is a MUST for this mission.
-  Try your best to avoid damage.
-  Near the end of the stage you'll have to fly through an ice cavern, activate
   you airbrake and stay LOW.
-  At the end of the ice cavern is your target, unload your SLAMRs as soon as
   you see the diamond lock.

IX.  Game Review

Blue Lightning was one of the pack-in games for the Jaguar CD.  It's more or
less an Afterburner clone.  Blue Lightning is usually panned by critics, but I
feel it's good game with two glaring flaws.

First, the graphics.  This is SUPPOSED to be a 64-bit system, why does the game
look like it could easily run on a SNES?  The CGI cutscenes aren't terrible,
but they don't really add much, in fact if they weren't there, this game could
have easily fit on a cartridge.

The other major flaw are the city missions.  I absolutely HATE them.  They are
by far the most frustrating (and unfair) missions in the game.  Flying between
the buildings without crashing is next to impossible.  There is a lot of pop
up, it looks like your path is clear, then out of nowhere a building appears
right in front of you giving you no time to dodge.  The collision detection
also screws you over here.  You'll constantly end up crashing even though
there was plenty of empty space between you and the building.

It isn't all bad, some of the missions, particularly the air attack ones, are a
lot of fun.  There are also a total of seven different planes to choose from,
which adds a lot of depth to the game, certain planes are better suited for
certain missions than others.  The game's soundtrack also shines, the rock
tunes fit the action well and are nicely done.

If you own a Jaguar CD and it didn't come with Blue Lightning, I'd recommend
trying to find a copy.  There relatively easy to find on eBay for under $10.
While it won't blow you away, Blue Lightning will provide you with several 
hours of entertainment.

Pros

+  Awesome soundtrack!
+  Seven different planes to fly, each with its own strengths/weaknesses.
+  Game is inexpensive and easy to find on eBay.

Cons

-  SNES caliber graphics.
-  Pop up during the city missions makes it difficult to avoid crashes.
-  Hit detection is WAY off.
