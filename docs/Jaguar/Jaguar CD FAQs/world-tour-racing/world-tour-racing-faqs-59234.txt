*******************************************************************************
III.   Game Modes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Single Race

Single Race allows one or two players to race on a single track.  After
choosing the number of players and track, you'll see the Race Weekend Menu:

Free Practice

Let's you run up to five practice laps on the track.  Your car will be
automatically guided from the pits onto the track.  Press Option to bring up
the Race Option Menu.  Here you can visit the workshop and change your setup
(Set-up), modify game options (Options), or return to the Race Weekend Menu
(End Practice).

Qualifying

Basically the same as Free Practice, except your goal is to get the best lap
time possible.  The time needed to get the pole position fluctuates and
becomes lower at higher difficulty levels.

Race

The main event.  You will start the race on the track at a complete stop in the
position you qualified in (if you skip qualifying you get stuck in 10th).  If
you go in to the Option menu, you'll notice that the Set-up option is missing,
so make sure you finish all of your customizations BEFORE entering the Race!

Abandon Event

Return to the Main Menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Championship

Championship allows a single player to race a full season on all 16 tracks.
You earn points based on the position you finish a race, the racer with the
most points at the end of the season wins.  After each race you'll be given a
password so you can continue where you left off.

When you choose Championship Mode, you'll go to the Championship Menu:

First Race

Head to the Race Weekend Menu for the USA track.  Everything here is identical
to Single Race Mode.

Enter Code

Enter your 32-digit password using the numpad.  Please be aware that the
password ONLY saves your total points, number of wins, and current track.
EVERYTHING else (difficulty, car setup, player name, etc.) will be lost when
you turn the power off.

Standing

View the current points standings.

Exit


Note:  The Points Chart in the instruction booklet is incorrect, here is the
       correct one:

Position     Points
  1st          9 pts.
  2nd          7 pts.
  3rd          5 pts.
  4th          3 pts.
  5th          2 pts.
  6th          1 pt.
  7th-10th     0 pts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Arcade

Play a one or two player arcade-style season.  Your goal is to make it through
all 16 tracks.  As you progress you will have to finish further up the field in
order to qualify for the next track.  If you fail to qualify in one player mode
your game will end.  In two player mode, if one player fails to qualify, he 
will get to move on to the next track, but he'll lose all his points.  If both
players fail to qualify, the game is over.

Unlike the other two modes, there is no Free Practice nor Qualifying in Arcade
Mode.  You ARE allowed to modify your setup by going into the Option menu like
usual.

Points

   1 pt.      Per Lap for each mph
 250 pts.     Overtaking an opponent
-500pts.      Losing a position to an opponent

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Basic Strategies

-  I recommend using an Automatic Gearbox.

-  Don't forget to use your brakes!  A single soft tap before a curve makes
   turning a LOT easier.

-  When using Soft Tires, be sure to keep the number of laps low so they
   don't wear out.

-  Avoid crashes, they will damage your car and losing a wing will absolutely
   kill your car's handling.

-  Cars ahead of you will be green on your radar while those behind will be
   blue.

-  Experiment with the various car setups to find one that best suits your
   driving style.

*******************************************************************************
V.     Workshop

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Tires

There are three types of tires:

- Soft
Soft tires give you the best grip but will wear out the fastest.

- Medium
Medium tires are a balance of grip and durability.

-  Hard
Hard tires have the least grip but the most durability.

Once your tires wear out, your car's handling will greatly decrease.  I
recommend that you use soft tires, as long as you keep the race distance under
five laps, you shouldn't have to worry about them wearing out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Wings

The wing angle affects grip and speed.  A higher wing angle means more grip
but less top speed while a lower angle gives you more speed but less grip.

Your car has a front and rear wing, these are adjusted separately.  Having a
higher angle on the rear wing than the front will give sharper steering.

Note:  In my recommended setups in the Tracks section, the + and - numbers
       represent how many marks to the right or left to move the slider from
       the center.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Gearbox

The gearbox allows you to customize the gear ratios using the slider.  Having
higher gears means more top speed but slower acceleration while shorter gears
give you better acceleration but lower top speed.

Note:  In my recommended setups in the Tracks section, the numbers represent
       how many marks from the left to move the slider.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Brakes

Here you can adjust the braking balance.  Moving the slider to the left will
cause your car to turn to the left when braking and moving the slider to the
right will cause your car to turn right while braking.  

Note:  In my recommended setups in the Tracks section, whenever I say +1, -3,
       etc., what I mean is that you move the slider so that its CENTER is
       lined up that many spaces to the right or left.

*******************************************************************************
VI.    Tracks

In this section I list my recommended setup for each track, my best lap time
with that setup, and the approximate times needed to qualify in the pole
position for each of the three difficulties.

B.  Cheats

I found the following two cheats on www.ataritimes.com:

Drive Bus

In Single Race or Championship Mode, hold 4 on the numpad when you select
Free Practice, Qualify, or Race to drive the bus.

Track Edit Mode

In Single Race or Championship Mode, hold 0 on the numpad when you select
Free Practice, Qualify, or Race.  A bunch of numbers will appear on screen.  
Use the joypad to make changes, then restart the race to drive on the modified
track.

VIII.  Game Review

World Tour Racing was released for the JaguarCD in May of 1997, nearly a year
after the end of Atari.  Several games for the JagCD were do-overs of cartridge
games, think of WTR as a do-over of Checkered Flag.

The biggest improvement over Checkered Flag is the controls, they're very
responsive and intuitive.  There are multiple customizations available so you
can fine tune your car to handle just the way you want it.  One feature I
like is the steering help, the AI automatically guides your car from the
pits onto the track and will also help during turns.

The graphics are also much better than in Checkered Flag.  The cars, tracks,
and backgrounds are much more detailed and the frame rate is a lot smoother.
There are a lot of CG cutscenes sprinkled throughout that look pretty good
for pre Final Fantasy 7.

The audio is a real disappointment, especially for a CD-ROM game.  There are
only three audio tracks and the quality is closer to a cartridge than a CD.
Checkered Flag had more digitized voiceovers, here the announcer is limited to
announcing the final lap.  

There are a couple of design decisions that are questionable.  The one I really
hate is the fact that there are AI racers on the track during qualifying, every
race fan knows that it should just be one driver at a time!

Another odd design decision is the lack of Memory Track support.  Trying
to beat your best lap times is what gives racing games such high replay values,
and the fact that the game doesn't save your times is a major downer.  There is
a password feature for the Championship Mode, but it doesn't save your name,
car config, or even the difficulty level.

One final nitpick is the instruction booklet, Telegames is notorious for having
poor game manuals and this game is no exception.  While not nearly as bad as
Brutal Sports Football, it still seems like it was slapped together at the last
second.  There are several mistakes: the points table for Championship Mode is
incorrect, it states there are 12 tracks (there are 16), it says Free Practice
is unlimited (you only get five laps), and it doesn't mention anything about
car damage.

World Tour Racing is second only to Super Burnout when it games to racers on
the Jaguar, if you own the JagCD, you should definitely check it out.

Pros

+  16 distinct tracks.
+  Your car is fully customizable.
+  Two player.

Cons

-  There is no excuse for having only 3 audio tracks on a CD-ROM game!
-  Doesn't make use of the Memory Track.
