*************************************************
In the future civilization dies in the cataclysms.  
The Draconians were born from the death of old Earth.  
Who will rule the new Urth?
*************************************************

Fighting games have recently swamped the arcades. They range from really
bad animation and graphics to just a plain old copy of another game.
Primal Rage changes that by having excellent graphics and unique
characters. But you say, "Who made this? Those dudes that made Asteroids?"
Yup, that's them. They have released two games in 1994 and Primal Rage is
one of them! Using what's called "Stop-Motion Animation," the graphics are
intense. You are given seven characters to choose from: prehistoric
dinosaurs, giant apes, and mythological creatures. Atari has put a lot of
work into it. Two years worth! The special moves system is also new and
different (see Special Moves). Primal Rage debuted at the 1994 CES in
Chicago, and was voted "Showstopper" by Game Pro Magazine.

Go see for yourself!

///1.1 Storyline///

     Before there were humans, gods walked the earth. They embodied the
essence of Hunger, Survival, Life, Death, Insanity, Decay, Good, and Evil.
They fought countless battles up through the Mesozoic Wars. Then Balsafas,
an archmage from a parallel dimension, anticipated the threat that Earth's
gods posed. He was not powerful enough to kill the gods, so instead he
banished one to a rocky tomb within the moon. This disrupted the fragile
balance between the gods; pandemonium ensued, and a great explosion threw
clouds of volcanic dust into the atmosphere. The dinosaurs died out, and
the surviving gods went into suspended animation.
     Now, the impact of a huge meteor strikes the Earth. Its destructive
force wipes out civilization, rearranges the continents, and frees the
imprisoned gods. Get ready to rumble...

///1.2 Meet the Critters///

ARMADON, God of Life 
a.k.a. "The Protector of the Ecosystem," "Tank Boy"
Based on: Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, Stegosaurus
Height: 17 feet
Length: 27 feet
Weight: 2.25 tons
Rage Factor: +121%
Consumption Rate: 570 lbs. per day
Domain: the Hollows, a big underground chamber filled with stalactites and
stalagmites. There are numerous cave openings with worshipers living in
them.

A big guy with lots of horns and spikes, Armadon is a slow mover and poor
jumper but has some of the game's easier combos, which are quite damaging
for their length. His combos run up to a maximum of 9-10 hits. Unlike the
other reptiles, Armie doesn't really "bite" but rather attacks with the
horn on his face. Probably the easiest character to use against the CPU,
because of his strength & high priority basic attacks. His original name
was "Spike" (perhaps that was before the game designers saw "The Land
Before Time"... ^_^)
    [from action figure Primal Profile]: "Guardian of the delicate and
fragile ecological balance, Armadon was the last of the dino-beasts to
emerge from his subterranean confines. Connected with Earth's lifeforce
and energy flow, Armadon ascended to save the planet from the dino-beasts
who want ultimate control over it. Ironically the battle for power raging
among the beasts has caused a nearly irreversible terminal imbalance on
the planet they are fighting to rule. Unable to tolerate the titans'
destruction of the planet, Armadon's mission is to put an end to the
battle for supremacy and the immense devastation caused by it."

BLIZZARD, God of Good
a.k.a. "The Noble Protector of Evolution," "Fahrenheit -451"
Based on: Gorilla/King Kong
Height: 20 feet
Weight: 1.8 tons
Rage Factor: +153%
Consumption Rate: 715 lbs. per day
Domain: the Cliff, an icy and mountainous area. There's a temple in the
mountainside to the right. The big mountain in the background has the
faint pattern of an ape face.

Blizzard is a big ape with powers of elemental cold and semi-invulnerable
rushing punches (sort of a de-evolved cross between Sub-Zero & Balrog :).
His freezing abilities are excellent for setting up killer combos, and his
air throw is good for cheezing the CPU. He can jump really high, too, but
lacks a Leaping Attack. Blizzard's recorded combos run up to 14 hits, more
if his multi-hit Punching Bag special move is involved.
    [from action figure Primal Profile]: "In order for life to continue
its natural progression, a delicate balance must be struck. This is the
atmosphere that Blizzard has fought for millions of years to maintain.
Enraged by the massive destruction he saw when he emerged from his primal
slumber, Blizzard has embarked on a relentless execution mission. As
guardian of natural evolution, Blizzard is determined to return Urth to
its former state. As leader of the Virtuous Beasts (Armadon, Blizzard,
Sauron, & Talon) Blizzard battles to return the balance to the Urth, even
if it means destroying each and every dino-beast in the process!"

CHAOS, God of Decay
a.k.a. "The Mighty Techno-Witch Doctor," "Bodily Function Man"
Based on: gorilla/Son of Kong 
Height: 17 feet
Weight: 1.1 tons
Rage Factor: 181.4%
Consumption Rate: <634 lbs. per day
Domain: the Ruins, a strip of land near the wreckage of what was once a
metropolis. A river flows in the background, and a beached yacht lies to
the left.

Similar to Blizzard but smaller, faster, and with slightly less jumping
power, Chaos is an ape prone to disgusting bodily functions. His flatulent
projectile is good for setting up combos, and his air Ground Shaker is
great for cheezing the CPU. By interrupting his 1+2 with a low 4, he can
string together combos up to 12+ hits in the corner. Though the entire PR
gang is quite vocal, Chaos is the only one who ever speaks a word - if he
loses a battle, he cries "No!" as he collapses. Chaos bears no relation
whatsoever to that diamond-lovin' "Martial Champions" babe.
    [from action figure Primal Profile]: "In his quest for control and
domination over the world, Chaos has become his own worst nightmare. Right
after the Cataclysms, he existed as a renegade scientist who wanted to
take control of the new Urth. But his desire to dictate the process of
human evolution proved to be his undoing when he conducted a genetic
experiment that went horribly wrong. Instead, he was turned into a
hideously disgusting beast."

DIABLO, God of Evil
a.k.a. "The Evil Flame Thrower," "EXTRA Toasty"
Based on: Allosaurus (a relative of T-rex)
Height: 17 feet
Length: 29 feet
Weight: 1.2 tons
Rage Factor: +155.9%
Consumption Rate: <525 lbs. per day
Domain: The Inferno, a rocky volcanic island created by a geothermic
upheaval ten times as great as that which made the Hawaiian islands.
Pyramids and stone sculptures lie among the active   volcanoes and lava.

A striped, bipedal fire-breathing reptile with a big mouth and useless
tiny foreclaws, quick on his feet and an excellent jumper. Instead of a
throw, he has a teleport with unblockable fire. Diablo's in-close game is
very weak (Chaos can even hit him out of Quick Attacks done within
range!), but the speed, power and versatility of his long range attacks
make him a good distance fighter. His combos top out at around 10 hits,
unless one buffers in hop jumps. Diablo bears no relation whatsoever to
that spandex-coated Marvel dweeb.
    [from action figure Primal Profile]: "Now that Diablo, leader of the
Destructive Dinos (Chaos, Diablo, & Vertigo), has been released from his
fiery prison deep within the Urth, he seeks to turn the world into a
raging inferno. Determined to pursue his vision for Urth as a dominion of
evil, Diablo thrives on inflicting immense pain and agony on his enemies.
His followers and foes alike believe that Diablo is evil incarnate.
Annihilation of all other dino-beasts is essential for Diablo to continue
his reign of terror and carry out his gruesome vision for Urth."

SAURON, god of Hunger
a.k.a. "The Carnivorous King of Hunger," "Ray, the Ugly Shape-changer on
Steroids"
Based on: Tyrannosaurus Rex
Height: 20 feet
Length: 27 feet
Weight: 2.5 tons
Rage Factor: +149.6%
Consumption Rate: 780 lbs. per day
Domain: the Cove, a sandy beach next to the ocean. A decaying
Parthenon-like temple lies in the background surf.

Sauron is similar to Diablo but larger; he's the biggest critter in the
game, and consequently the biggest combo target. Both Diablo and Sauron
walk differently than real Allosaurs/Tyrannosaurs, which most likely held
their heads and upper bodies lower to the ground. He is somewhat slow (yet
presumably faster than real T-rexes ever were), a medium jumper, and
dishes out major damage. His air-throw and air Earthquake Stomp are
excellent for cheezing the CPU. Doing combos above 8 hits is almost
impossible unless you buffer in an extra jump. (The Ring, the Ring, WHERE
IS THE RING?!?!?)
    [from action figure Primal Profile]: "For some dino-beasts,
immortality comes at a price. For Sauron, the cost is nothing less than an
insatiable appetite. From his first appearance on the new Urth, one of the
Virtuous Beasts, attracted many believers. All of Urth is the battlefield
for Sauron, as he towers into war after war, in his quest for domination!
Waging war with the primal titans is what Sauron lives for, for in their
defeat is tomorrow's lunch."

TALON, God of Survival
a.k.a. "The Protector of the Innocent," "The Little Bastard"
Based on: Deinonychus (a relative of Velociraptor)
Height: 16 feet
Length: 30 feet
Weight: 0.9 tons
Rage Factor: +109.77%
Consumption Rate: 408 lbs. per day
Domain: the Strip, a grassy stretch of land dotted with trees. The number
49 is faintly visible in the ground at center screen. A waterfall splashes
off to the right.

The smallest and fastest critter in the game, Talon is a striped raptor
with a feathered crest running along the back of his neck. His teeth are
visible only on the front half of his mouth, and he has a large upraised
claw on the second toe of each foot. (Deinonychi normally kept this claw
cocked so as not to interfere with moving about, but brought it down to
slash at their prey's belly). His size makes him a frustratingly small
target; he can even duck completely underneath most projectiles. That
combined with his excellent jumping ability makes up for his lack of a
projectile move. As further compensation, he also has the only special
moves in the game with auto-hits: his two-hit Jugular Bite, and three-hit
Pounce & Flip.
     Talon is the only critter who flips during his jumps, and the only
reptile who can attack with his front claws. He cannot attack with his
tail, which incidentally is much more flexible than the rigid,
balancing-pole tails of real Deinonychi. His speed and high-priority air
attacks make him one of the easiest characters to use vs. human or CPU
opponents. His biggest weaknesses are probably his short range and the low
damage rating of virtually all his attacks (on version 2.3, at least).
Thanks to his combo-extending Slasher move, Talon can get 12-hit combos on
big characters with relative ease. It's hard to do more than 10 hits on
small characters. 15-hit combos are possible if a big opponent is
cornered. Talon bears no relation whatsoever to that cyborg loser from
Bloodstorm, or that gal hawk-warrior from "The Aniverse", or that
cat-wizard from "Marvel 3099", or...
    [from action figure Primal Profile]: "Talon is in his most vicious
state when it comes to the defense of his raptor clan. Before the
Cataclysms, Talon's home was peaceful and harmonious; but now Talon and
his followers have been thrust into an unfamiliar life of power struggles,
battling between tribes and dino-beasts."

VERTIGO, Goddess of Insanity
a.k.a. "The Mesmerizing Sorceress," "I am Woman, Hear Me Hiss"
Based on: king cobra, Sellosaurus (mistakenly named "Efraasia")
Height: 18 feet
Length: 48 feet
Weight: 1.3 tons
Rage Factor: +120.37%
Consumption Rate: 597 lbs. per day
Domain: the Tomb, a grassy knoll with Stonehenge-style rock structures.
Images of Vertigo's petrified enemies are visible in the leftmost stones.
A full moon is in the sky.

The only female PR critter, Vertigo has a body shaped somewhat like that
of a Sellosaurus (a young Sellosaurus was once mistakenly called
"Efraasia", hence the word in GamePro's articles & PR Strategy Guide).
Like Sellosaurus, she is a lightly built with legs longer than her
forearms, and has a long neck & tail. Unlike Sellosaurus, she has only two
fingers on her front hands (Sellosaurus had five) and the head & hood of a
king cobra. Her hood is outlined with small spikes, and has white markings
on its back resembling a long-toothed skull. Her original name was
"Cobrasaur," but that was too obvious. ^_^ She spits venom and hisses
instead of crying out.
     Vertigo can't jump much higher than Armadon; she's only a little
faster than him on the ground, and *painfully* slow in the air unless she
uses a long jump or hop jump. Vertigo is the weakest PR character in terms
of damage per attack, but her attacks possesses the longest reach, and
that combined with her Come Slither special move lets her do combos up to
14 hits on any opponent, in or out of the corner. She can cast spells,
too; her teleports and unblockable "Voodoo Spell" help make up for her
lack of a regular throw or leaping attack. Unlike the rest of the PR gang,
she cannot kick with her hind legs. Her lack of any basic or special
anti-air move outside of some jumping attacks is a significant liability.
Vertigo bears no relation whatsoever to that loopy count from "Batman
Adventures," or that mutantess from the X-Men cartoon...
    [from action figure Primal Profile]: "Total insanity governs Vertigo's
every action. With her mesmerizing powers of mind control and mastery of
the unknown, she has attained mythical proportions among her followers.
Vertigo's followers are loyal and their devotion is complete, fanatical
and blind. She believes the defeat of all other dino-beasts can only be
accomplished by utilizing her sorcery and the power of her devout
followers... if she doesn't destroy their minds first."

????, God of Death?
a.k.a. "Property of Golden Axe III"
Based on: Advanced Dungeons & Dragons dracolich?
Height: ?
Length: ?
Weight: ?
Domain: Dinosaur Graveyard [of the Final Battle]? This area is littered
with mounds of dinosaur bones, including a couple big skeletons propped up
to the left. The ground has bright red cracks in it, and there's a huge,
swirling vortex in the sky.

There was going to be another PR upgrade that reportedly would add a
dragon-skeleton boss capable of flight & with an energy-siphoning power.
Alack, the upgrade plans were scrapped, so that the boss shall live only
in our imaginations... (and in my Mortal Kombat fanfic, "The Coming of
Winter." Sauron, Vertigo, & some of Talon's cousins also have bit parts!

///2.1  Normal Moves///

Primal Rage has four buttons arranged in a square, and a joystick.  The
first vertical column of buttons are "Quick" attacks.  The second are
"Fierce."  The upper horizontal row of buttons are "High" attacks, and the
bottom row are "Low" attacks. Both High buttons or both Low buttons
pressed together are an extra-damaging "Power" attack, just like the AB
and CD attacks in Samurai Shodown. The High Quick button also functions as
the "start" button.

In addition to ASCII representations, the buttons will be referred to as
1=High Quick, 2=High Fierce, 3=Low Quick, 4=Low Fierce. A "+" signifies
that two buttons are pressed together; for example, "1+2" indicates that
both the High Quick and the High Fierce buttons are pressed at the same
time.

Player 1 side joystick and button configuration:

      Up-Away  Up   Up-Toward              Strong
              (UA)  (U)   (UT)            ___|___
                O    O    O                    |       |
                 \   |   /                   Quick  Fierce

Away (A) O--         --O Toward (T)       O       O

                 /   |   \                     O       O
                O    O    O
    Down-Away  Down  Down-Toward
      (DA)     (D)      (DT)

"Standing" means that the character is standing normally during the move
(joystick is neutral); "low" or "crouching" means that the character is
crouching during the move (joystick is held down).

Key:
O = button pressed
. = button not pressed
U = Up
T = Toward
A = Away
D = Down
UT = Up & Toward 
UA = Up & Away 
DT = Down & Toward
DA = Down & Away
Full = Do a full circle
  Toward = full circle clockwise when facing right  (T-D-A-U)
  Away = full circle counterclockwise when facing right  (T-U-A-D)
  (think of a wheel rolling "away" or "toward" you're opponent)

A hyphen (-) represents a fluid motion, in which you roll the joystick.
For example:
      D-T       is       |  \  --O      which is Sub-Zero's (MK) freeze
motion
                            O   O          or Ken's (SF2) fireball motion.

A comma (,) means that you just tap the joystick. For example:
      D, U      is     |    O         which is Guile's (SF2) flash kick
motion
                          O    |

Note: many special moves let you get away with either tapping or rolling
the joystick, but most fatalities specifically require one or the other.

All characters:
O . = Quick Bite   . O = Chomp   O O = Big Chomp
. .                          . .                     . .

[or, 1=quick bite, 2=chomp, 1+2=big chomp]

. . = Quick Tail   . . = Tail    . . = Big Tail
O .                     . O           O O

[3=quick tail, 4=tail, 3+4=big tail]

Move specific to Talon and the Apes (Chaos and Blizzard):
     |      . .   = Slide
    O   O O
[crouching 3+4. BTW the apes' "slide kick" is reminiscent of Cammy's
crouching Roundhouse or Nakoruru's crouching CD]

Talon also has a short slide which is:
       |    . .
      O   . O
[crouching 4]

///2.2 Special Moves///

   We'll be classifying special moves into eight types:  Projectiles,
Leaping Attacks, Unblockables, Stomps, Teleports, Anti-air,
Anti-projectile and "generic" attacks.  Projectiles & Teleports are
self-explanatory, and "generic attacks" are basically "special" punches or
kicks.  The rest require some explanation.  Leaping Attacks are specially
guided jumping attacks which were unblockable in version 1.7, and can only
be blocked high in version 2.3. Leaping Attacks are too slow to be combo'd
after basic attacks, although you can still interrupt basic attacks with
them, and some Leaping Attacks can be followed up with more hits. Stomps
are attacks in which the character stomps the ground and tries to shake up
his opponent. They were unblockable in version 1.7; you had to avoid them
by jumping. In version 2.3, you must either jump or block a Stomp low,
otherwise it will toss you into the air for a beating!  
     Unblockables are special moves which cannot be blocked, such as
throws. Attempting an Unblockable move on a character in block-stun will
causes a cheeze warning - see Misc. Info for more on cheezey stuff! If you
do a ground-based throw when your opponent is an invalid target (in the
air, in block-stun, still getting up from a knockdown, or too far away),
your character will go through a "missed throw" animation during which you
may get pounded. "Missed throw" animations can be used as taunts by the
creative! ^_^ One Unblockable move, Vertigo's Voodoo Spell, is not a
throw. You can always jump to avoid Unblockables, but if your opponent
fakes you into jumping at the wrong time, he can retaliate with an
anti-air move!
     Anti-air moves work especially well against airborne opponents
(particularly since you cannot block in the air), but can also hit
opponents on the ground. Anti-air moves aren't necessarily 100%
invulnerable to all air attacks, so be careful! In general, your
character's exposed back or hindquarters are a vulnerable target, and most
special moves leave a character open to a low 3+4 or similar attacks.
Anti-projectile moves are useful for bypassing a projectile and attacking
the enemy at the same time. Leaping Attacks technically fall into this
category (if executed with *extremely* swift timing) but for practical
purposes they're given their own class. Throws that hit and a few other
moves render you temporarily immune to projectiles, but have an extremely
short attacking range (and if you're that close a smart opponent isn't
likely to toss projectiles anyway). The other anti-projectile moves
usually have a limited or very specific invulnerability area/period and
attacking range; if you mis-time the move you'll run into the projectile,
and if the enemy's too near or far, you won't hit him and may be
susceptible to counterattack. 

   The Primal Rage special move system works opposite the standard; to do
a special move, you press _and hold down_ the appropriate buttons, then
execute the joystick motion. Unlike certain Killer Instinct shadow moves,
you do not have to let go of the buttons to complete the special move.
You'd better do so anyway, though, unless you like to stand still forever
- you can't move or block while holding down the buttons for special
moves, except Talon's "Run".

   Despite Primal Rage's attempt to revolutionize the "special move"
system, the new version 2.3 upgrade allows you to execute moves either
through the proprietary PR style or through "traditional" style
button/joystick motion. Probably due to a lot of "I can't do the moves"
(read the cabinet next time...!) from new players. So much for "onward and
upward."

   The version 2.3 upgrade contains new programming which allows you to
execute joystick motions, _then_ press the requisite buttons. Even 360
degree moves like Blizzard's Punching Bag can be done the traditional way,
provided that you move joystick so quickly that Blizzard doesn't jump by
accident. In a few situations this has caused unintentional special moves,
but in general it does make the special moves more forgiving. (tho' some
would consider this bad... "oh, no, now _anyone_ can freeze my butt?" :)

  All Special Moves listed work on a Primal Rage version 2.3 arcade
machine, SNES PR, or IBM PC PR with a four-button game pad. They should
all work on PSX, 3DO, Jaguar CD, and Saturn PR as well. As for Genesis &
32X PR, be aware that "version 2.3 only" moves & fatalities are not in
those versions. Game Boy/Game Gear PR have their own movelist separate
from this FAQ. If IBM PC PR is played with the keyboard or two-button game
pad, then the moves are different; see the PR for PC FAQ for more
information. 

These moves have been personally confirmed by yours truly on a PR arcade
machine (yes, even Armadon's Meditation! I can actually do it now! :).
Note that the arcade manager can set a GORE/NO GORE switch. In NO GORE
mode, all the blood is turned off, all fatalities are disabled, and you
cannot eat people; they'll just bounce into the air. Major bummer...

  ^  indicates 'Combo Starter and/or Extender.' Marks special moves that
can be followed up with ground or volley hits. 
    All special moves can interrupt basic attacks; the overwhelming
majority of special moves can be combo'd after a basic attack, and most
special moves will end a combo. A few special moves, such as Armadon's
Iron Maiden, are too slow and require too much recovery time to be part of
a combo at all.

  *  indicates 'Finishing Move'
     NOTE1: These can be done from ANYWHERE but don't stand too close or
you'll hit your opponent while trying to hold down the buttons! For those
'two-part' fatalities such as Vertigo's Petrify, hold the first two
buttons while you do the first set of joystick movements, then press the
remaining buttons WHILE STILL holding the first two buttons, and finish
the remaining joystick movements. 
    NOTE2: you _must_ do the fatalities _quickly_ or they won't work. Do
not pause between the halves of a two-part fatality. If you mess up, you
can typically re-enter the fatality at least once more before time runs
out, so keep trying and don't give up!
    Easy enough? ^_^

  ** indicates 'Chomp a human for more life.' Chomp a Human moves can hit
opponents for a little damage.

///ARMADON///   (The Hollows)

///BLIZZARD/// (The Cliff)
_________________________________________________
|  Mega Punch (Short): Gives your opponent a big bash to the head.
Projectiles or attacks to his upper body will pass harmlessly through him
during the windup, just like all other Mega Punches. The Short Mega Punch
has a brief wind-up, short range, and little recovery time. It's quick
enough to use after a low 3+4. Anti-air & anti-projectile (also immune to
all Earthquake attacks).

| Mega Punch (Quick): This punch has the fastest wind-up, medium range,
and the longest recovery time. It can be used after the low 3+4. Anti-air.
Anti-projectile against very fast projectiles only (also immune to all
Earthquake attacks).

| Mega Punch (Long): This has the same wind-up and recovery time as the
Short Mega Punch, and the longest range. In version 1.7, it did more
damage than the other two Mega Punches. Anti-air & anti-projectile (also
immune to all Earthquake attacks).

|_________________________________________________
| ^ Freeze Breath (a.k.a. "Cold Breath"): Chill your opponent out Sub-Zero
style, immobilizing him for a brief time, and hit him with a combo before
he thaws. Don't use both the Freeze Breath and the Ice Geyser in a combo,
or you'll get a No Cheeze meter! The Freeze Breath is slower and more
difficult to combo after basic attacks than the Ice Geyser, but does
inflict slightly more damage. On version 2.3, enemies don't stay frozen
for as long. Projectile.

little damage and freezing the opponent as per his Freeze Breath. Don't
use both the Ice Geyser and the Freeze Breath in a combo, or you'll get a
No Cheeze meter! Victim must be close and either in the air or not
blocking. Enemies don't stay frozen for as long on version 2.3. Anti-air.

|_________________________________________________
| ^ Punching Bag: Grab and stun your opponent until he shakes out of it
(by rapidly moving his joystick back and forth). Quickly hit button 1
several times to beat him up, then before his brain meter regenerates and
he escapes your grasp, tap another button to deliver the wind up punch:
2=low arc, 3=medium arc, 4=high arc. The Punching Bag can be followed up
with various volley attacks. It is the punches, not the grab, that hurt
the opponent and count as combo hits. This is a fairly weak move in and of
itself. Multi-hit move. Unblockable (throw).

NOTE: Even if the victim does not actively shake out of the Punching Bag,
his brain meter slowly regenerates anyway, and once it's full the Punching
Bag comes to an end. Shaking out of the Punching Bag is pretty easy to do.
On an actively resisting second player or the CPU, one can typically get
5-7 hits out of this move (not counting follow-up attacks). On a passive
second player, I've gotten up to 43 hits with my own finger power, and an
absolute maximum of 48 hits using the turbo setting on my SNES joystick.

| Air Throw: Grab opponent in the air. Useful in combos too. On arcade
version 2.3 only, Blizzard can air-throw some opponents (Blizzard, Chaos,

special move. Unblockable (throw).

cloud makes contact, it does no damage and won't count as a combo hit, yet
it will stun the opponent until he shakes out of it (by rapidly moving his
joystick back and forth). Unlike other projectiles, the FoFury will
disappear after traveling a single screen length. Projectile (cannot be

The flame must burn for a moment before it can hit his opponent; hold the

about half-way across the screen at his opponent's feet, knocking him
down. If Diablo's victim is cornered then the Hot Foot can be followed up
with a low 1, which will bounce him in the air for two more volley hits.

others. Vertigo cannot be volleyed after the Hot Foot.

side. If the opponent is far away, Diablo may reappear in the same place.
The fire during Diablo's disappearance (not his reappearance) is a
short-range attack that will damage the enemy and stun him for a short

///2.3  Jumping///

   All characters can do three types of jumps in Primal Rage. First, to do
a standard jump, just press up or diagonally up like any other fighting
game. Pretty easy, eh? The second type of jump is the long jump. To do a
long jump, tap down, then do a "normal" jump immediately afterward This
jump will be higher and faster than the standard jump, and it will go much
farther. No more characters whose only jump is a drifter... The third type
of jump is the most difficult, and most surprising jump in any game. A
"hop jump" (a.k.a. "tiger jump") is the shortest possible jump and
*extremely* fast! You do a hop jump by pushing the joystick in the
direction you want to jump, then down, then do the standard jump (either
tapping or rolling the joystick will work). Additionally, the hop jump can
now be done straight up, just tap toward (or away), down, and straight up!
 Unlike version 1.7, Primal Rage version 2.3 lets you execute hop jumps
versus the computer, and the computer can use them against you, too!
Here's a chart to summarize the three different jumps:

Jump Type    | Toward | Away         | Up
________________________________
normal jump  |  UT         | UA          | U
long jump      |  D, UT    | D, UA      | D, U
hop jump       | T, D, UT | A, D, UA | T or A, D, U

     For even more excitement, you can buffer in hop jumps so that they
interrupt your power attacks! Chris Tang (TANG@agames.com) writes:

>There are extremely effective techniques that utilize this move. My
favorite is jumping in with one or two hits, following up with two or
three ground attacks which end in a power. While the power comes out, I
buffer in the motion for the hop jump- F, D, U. As soon as my power makes
collision, my hop jump will send me straight up into the air, where I can
launch an attack to catch a low-blocking opponent off-guard. Also, this
technique can be used for hit-and-run blocked combos by using the
backwards hop-jump instead. This style of play is fast, frantic, and
aggressive. It's also a lot of fun.

Note: Long jumps & hop jumps are not in Game Boy/Game Gear PR. They should
be in every other version, though.

///2.4  Combos///

   Yes, you too can do devastating combos in PR. You can even volleyball
your opponent in the air! Combos are easy to execute. PR has a fully
orthogonal interrupt-driven combo system. That means the "rules" for
combos are [from GamePro's PR Guide]:

1. There are three "levels" of attacks: quick/fierce, power, & special
moves
2. Any special move can interrupt any quick, fierce, or power attack
3. Any power attack can interrupt any quick or fierce attack

NOTE1: Not all quick attacks can necessarily be combo'd into all fierce
attacks, though many can. Some fierce attacks can be combo'd with quick
attacks only if the enemy is very close. As an example: low 1, low 1, low
4 works great for Talon but not for Armadon. In a very few cases, a power
attack will interrupt a quick attack but will still be too slow to combo
(Talon's low 1, 3+4 will not combo).

NOTE2: All characters can start a combo by stringing most of their quick
attacks together (example: Talon's 3, 3, 3, 3 combo), and it is
occasionally possible to string fierce attacks together (Armadon's
in-close 2, 2, 2). Each character has a few stronger basic attacks that
can be interrupted with basic attacks of equal or weaker strength. Most of
these happen to be in-close attacks. Here's a list of examples I've found
in the arcade and on my PC (note: some of these work better on certain
opponents, or combo'd after air hits).

Armadon: in-close 2, 2, 2 | in-close 4, 2 | in-close 3+4, low 1
Blizzard, Chaos: in-close 2, 1 | in-close 1+2, 1 | 1+2, low 4 | low 3+4,
low 4
Diablo, Sauron: low 2, low 1 | in-close 4, 3 | in-close 3+4, 3
Talon: in-close 2, 3 | 4, low 1 | 3+4, low 1
Vertigo: in-close 1+2, 1 | in-close 4, low 4 | in-close 3+4, low 4

     Basic and special moves can both be "buffered" into a combo. In a
combo that alternates between bites and tail attacks, you must tap the
buttons quickly. In a combo that chains bites together or chains tail
attacks together, you must tap the buttons even more quickly. Combo hits
can be done at any time - whenever you hit an opponent, you can tack on
another hit, unless the knockback pushes your opponent too far away. EVEN
IN THE AIR! You can do a maximum of two attacks in the air (and possibly
follow up with Chaos' air Ground Shaker or Sauron's air Earthquake). Air
hits make great combo starters or enders! Each character has certain air
combos that are easier to use, because they have better range, are harder
to counter, or are less likely to knock the opponent too far back. Here
are some of the easier air combo starters:

Armadon: air 4, air 3+4 | air 2, air 1+2
Blizzard, Chaos: air 4, air 3+4 | air 4, air 1+2
Diablo, Sauron: air 4, air 3+4 | air 4, air 1+2
Talon: air 4, air 1+2 | air 2, air 1+2
Vertigo: air 3, air 3+4 | air 4, air 3+4

Note that if your air hit(s) strike your opponent too high, you might not
be able to extend the combo with ground hits. Hitting too high doesn't
occur as frequently as in games like SF2, though, especially if you use a
long/hop jump, get two air hits, or fight a small opponent.

Special attacks can be used to end any combination, or prolong it!  Many
special moves such as Blizzard's Ice Geyser have a greater range when used
within combos, and every character has at least one special move that can
be followed up with more hits or volleys. Note that any given combo cannot
have more than five of the same basic attack, one low 3+4, and one of any
given special move (slow and fast projectiles are considered different
special moves).

Are your combos still too short? Extend them by using two jumps! Just
buffer a hop-jump into your air hits, and you can score another couple air
hits followed by the rest of your combo! Sauron's 8-hit THE SECRET OF THE
COW combo is an example of this: air 4, air 3+4, (hop jump) air 4, air
1+2, 1, 2, 1+2, Primal Scream. 

And there's a bonus (three, actually)! Be forewarned that if you get a No
Cheeze meter, then your combo will end and the cheezey move you did won't
count as a combo hit or inflict damage. 

Thunder claps with lightning will happen if you do at least 4 hits _and_ a
minimum of 35% damage. To find out how many hits & how much damage your
combo did, just look at the left or right side of the screen, depending on
whether you're on the one-player or two-player side. [When the CPU does
combos on you, its side will display the number of hits in the combo but
not the damage rating, and the CPU never gets lightning or combo names.]

If you haven't seen it, the thunder and lightning are incredible.
Especially when you're not expecting it (but I guess you are now. =) In
v2.3, you get as many claps as you got hits! (in 1.7 you could only get
10!) [Notes: Vertigo can get one clap of lightning in version 2.3 if she
uses a teleport in any combo. PR for the IBM PC only bequeaths one clap of
lightning no matter how many hits your combo had.] Due to the decreased
damages for attacks in v2.3, lightning is less often seen, but IT IS
THERE! Finding combos that do more than 35% damage is harder now than
ever, though!
     Unfortunately, it isn't any easier to get lightning during the Final
Battle. Even though attacks on a dead/flickering opponent will do extra
damage [see Final Battle section], the damage percentiles calculated to
determine lightning & displayed on the side of the screen will reflect how
much damage the combo would have done, if your opponent were alive &
healthy.
    Don't despair if you can't get a thunderbolt 'n' lightning (very very
frightening(ly!)) combo; there is another reward for using special moves
in combos! If you use certain moves in a combination, a "name" for the
combo will be printed out in the top center of the screen! Unfortunately,
only the arcade version 2.3, PR for the IBM personal computer, and PR for
the Sony Playstation are known to have combo names. There are no combo
names in PR arcade version 1.7, or PR for the SNES, Genesis, Game Boy,
Game Gear, 32X, Jaguar CD; probably not 3DO or Saturn PR either.
   All of the named combos have three 'levels.' The named combos are
usually activated by one or more special moves, though a few are triggered
by certain basic moves or some combination of basic + special moves. There
is also a minimum hit requirement, which can be anywhere from 3 to 50 hits
for a given combo name. For example, if you use Sauron's Neck Throw in a
combo which hits at least 4 times, you'll see "CRUNCHY." If the combo hits
at least 6 times, you'll see "EXTRA CRUNCHY." If the combo hits at least 7
times you'll see "TAKE A BITE OUTTA CRIME!" So the combo naming scheme
goes something like that - the first level is "[NAME]", the second level
is usually "SUPER [NAME]" or some modifier, and the third level is a weird
variation on the first two, with an exclamation "!" or question "?" mark
at the end (one has "...").
     On both versions, "streakers" or naked worshipers (Nudalities!!! :)
will dash across the screen if Vertigo does a 5-hit or higher combo ending
in the Come Slither, or Armadon does a 5-hit or higher combo ending with
the Hornication Uppercut. No one has been able to eat these guys, and not
for lack of trying, so perhaps it isn't possible to chomp them.

///Post-Mortem Combos///

PR lets you finish your combos even if your opponent runs out of health in
the middle of 'em. "Post-mortem" combos occur when the opponent is
defeated before the last hit of the combo takes place. If you finish your
second victory with a post-mortem combo, you'll still have the usual
chance to do a fatality.
     There are only two cases when post-mortem combos don't work. First,
post-mortem combos cannot be done during the Final Battle. Second, the
instant that one critter is defeated, all projectiles will no longer touch
either player for what's left of the round. This makes it easier to do
fatalities, since a late projectile won't hit your victim by accident and
mess up your attempt. A side effect, however, is that post-mortem combos
ending with a projectile don't entirely work; the projectile will pass
harmlessly through your opponent. In order to get combo names that are
tied into projectile finishes, the entire combo must hit while your enemy
is still healthy enough to take it.

Key:
(1) (2)   Numbers are for which buttons are being pressed.
(3) (4)

   air - hit the buttons while you are jumping 
   low - hit the buttons while crouching
   in-close - denotes a very close-range basic attack, usually with
special animation & extra damage; e.g. Blizzard's in-close 2 is a more
damaging headbutt instead of a punch
   whiff - move does not actually hit opponent
   [corner] - victim must be in the corner when combo starts
   [corner cross-up glitch] - Armadon or Talon must be the victim, and
they must be crossed up, in the corner, _and_ recovering from a Leaping
Attack. In the arcade version only, this produces a freak situation with
zero knockback; you can string up to five crouching quick attacks in a row
for extra-long combos. This glitch doesn't seem to work when I play as
Armadon.
   [cross-up]- victim must be hit behind his center of mass when combo
starts (easiest to do when you just dodged his Leaping Attack by jumping
straight up)
   [deep] - victim must be close by/hit deep when combo starts
   [medium] - victim must be medium distance away when combo starts (may
be very precise)
   [far] - victim must be far away when combo starts
   [very far] - victim must be on the other side of the screen when combo
starts
   [arcade] - combo may not work on home versions, due to increased
knockback
   [cheezey] - combo will earn a No Cheeze meter
   (A, B, C, D, S, T, or V) - combo works best on character(s) whose
initial is listed. Other characters tend to be too small or get knocked
too far back.
   * - combo is known to earn lightning
   x% - ver. 2.3 damage percentiles are added where known, assuming that
the attacker hasn't gone ballistic in a two-player game (see section 6.4,
"Going Ballistic").

   Combo names are listed both with combos and separately. Thanks to Sir
Galahad's search of the text file of PR for the IBM PC, we now have _all_
combo names, and yours truly has personally devised & done a combo to earn
each name! :-) The triggering move(s) of a combo names are listed in
{curly brackets}. Minimum hit requirements are listed in (parentheses).
Combo names with the same trigger are grouped together, from shortest to
longest. Corrections or additions are quite welcome.

     MASTER OF DISASTER!

Note: I talked with a PR programmer about Chaos' BOUNCER combo names. It
seems that some glitch prevents the BOUNCER names from appearing when one
does a combo involving Chaos' air Ground Shaker (believe me, I've tried).
The BOUNCER names exist only in the game's text files. :-(

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+++++++++++++++ 3.  Brain Gauge+++++++++++++++++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under your health bar (the big artery extending from your heart) is your
Brain Gauge.  Each time you take or block a hit, your brain gauge goes
down. If your brain gauge ever reaches "empty" when you get hit (_not_
while blocking), electricity will loudly crackle around your brain and you
will become stunned.  Although you can't get stunned while blocking, you
can still be taken to "empty" brain, allowing a quick stun with few
successful hits thereafter.

   Brain power regenerates quickly; as long as you don't get hit for a
while you will soon be fine.  However, if you _do_ become stunned, shake
the joystick left and right (nothing else will help!) to regain your brain
faster. Once it reaches "full" again you will return to normal. This also
works for "auto stuns" from certain special moves: Blizzard's Punching
Bag, Chaos' FoFury, and Vertigo's Voodoo Spell. Auto stuns from other
special moves (Blizzard's Freeze Breath and Ice Geyser, Diablo's Inferno
Flash and Torch, Vertigo's Come Slither) last for only a short while
whether you try to shake out of it or not.
     Note that if a character's brain meter is emptied during a combo,
he'll become dizzy when the combo is completed. If his brain meter is
emptied with a hit or combo that knocks him down, he'll be dizzy when he
gets back up.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
++++++++++++++ 4.  Offense and Defense++++++++++++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

///4.1  Offense///

   Mix it up! Using attacks that require the opponent to block low and
high alternately can be very disturbing (not to mention frustrating!), so
know which attacks must be blocked high and which low! Same goes for being
on defense - see that section for more details. Stomps can be blocked low
on version 2.3. The old "Leaping Attacks" can now be blocked with standing
blocks (just press away!), although your recovery time from the block is
seriously long, so the only bad result of doing a Leaping Attack is being
vulnerable in the air (though you do also land close to your opponent, so
if you're a distance fighter...). The exception is Talon's Brain Basher -
it's possible for an opponent like Armadon to block it and then uppercut
him with a low 1+2.
   Remember that on version 2.3, all blocked basic attacks and nearly all
blocked special attacks _do damage_ to your opponent. Unlike most other
games, this damage is indeed significant, and will tip any close match.
Block damage can be used to beat reclusive opponents, human or CPU, if you
can sustain an assault for long enough. Just do "dink" damage for the
entire round, and when the clock runs out and the other guy has no health
left...

   Blocking in Primal Rage starts off simple: to block a high attack, pull
directly away from your opponent on the joystick. To block a low attack,
pull down and away on the joystick. Don't touch or hold down the buttons
while doing this, or you won't be blocking! If you get hit once, and
someone starts to unleash a combo, you can't block it. That's why it's
called a combo! So, the moral of the story is... don't get hit! ^_^ On the
other hand, sometimes a human player or even the CPU will accidentally
pause in the middle of a combo, unintentionally ending it early and giving
you a chance to block their next attack.

   New in version 2.3 is block damage. Well, not entirely new, but now all
blocked basic attacks & almost all blocked special attacks do significant
"tick" damage to the blocker's heart meter, and slight damage to the brain
gauge. However, you can't usually die from taking block damage, no matter
how little health you have left! So turtle up when you're running on
empty! [Note: there seems to be an unintentional exception: if the block
damage of a move precisely equals the amount of health left, then blocking
it can be fatal. This has been seen many times with block damage from
basic attacks like Vertigo's low 3+4, and special attacks like Armadon's
Iron Maiden.]

Block these attacks high. Many involve a descending overhead strike. Note
that all Leaping Attacks must be blocked high.

1) Armadon's low 3 and Iron Maiden
2) Blizzard's 3+4
3) Chaos' 4, 3+4, and Flying Butt Slam
4) Diablo's Pulverizer
5) Sauron's Leaping Bone Bash
6) Talon's 1+2 and Brain Basher
7) All air attacks, of course. Be extra careful on combo'd air attacks -
you have to block both hits high!

Block these low; most of them involve a strike to the feet. Note that
Earthquakes and everyone's low 3+4 must always be blocked low:

1) Armadon's low 4 and low 3+4
2) Blizzard's low 3, low 4, and low 3+4
3) Chaos' low 3, low 4, low 3+4, and Ground Shaker
4) Diablo's low 3, low 4, low 3+4, and Hot Foot
5) Sauron's low 3, low 4, low 3+4, and Earthquake Stomp
6) Talon's low 4 and low 3+4
7) Vertigo's low 3+4 and Come Slither

All basic & special moves not on either list can be blocked high or low
(except Unblockable special moves, which cannot be blocked at all). I
checked on my SNES! ^_^

4.2.2 Cross-up Attacks

     Beware cross-up air attacks, which hit you so far behind that you
must push the joystick forward to block! Each character has a center of
mass located at about the abdomen. If an attack hits you in front of your
center of mass, you can defend normally. If it hits behind your center of
mass, you must hold your joystick in the opposite direction instead. The
2.3 CPU Talon likes to do cross-up air 1+2s on you as you're getting up
from a knockdown! When buffering a special air attack into air cross-up
hits, do the move in the direction you're facing when airborne. Do special
moves the ordinary way when buffering them into ground hits, cross-up or
not.
     Armadon's Spinning Death is another example. If Armie times it
precisely as you get up, he'll be spinning behind your center of mass -
you must hold the joystick in the opposite direction you'd otherwise hold
it, or you will get hurt. The 2.3 CPU Armadon does this every once in a
while. 
     There is a particular arcade version only cross-up corner-trap that
can get you a No Cheeze meter! Take Vertigo vs player (or CPU) Armadon.
Armadon does the Iron Maiden when Vertigo is standing in the right-hand
corner. Vertigo jumps up to avoid the attack, and comes down directly
above Armadon, who is recovering from his special move. Facing away from
the corner [left], she bites him with lots of low 1s. The low 1s hit
Armadon behind his center of mass, so the knockback sends him back toward
the corner, right into Vertie's jaws! If Vertie tries to use more than
five 1s in a single combo she'll get a No Cheeze meter, which is the only
thing that keeps this trap from turning into a an infinite combo.

4.2.3 Avoiding Projectiles

Jumping to avoid projectiles can be hazardous to your health. If you take
off with a long jump or Leaping Attack as soon as your opponent begins to
fire, you might be able to score a hit, but then again you might not clear
the projectile and/or jump straight into an anti-air attack. All
characters seem to be more vulnerable to projectiles underneath them if
they do a jumping High Attacks (jumping Low Attacks are safer). For
example, if Vertigo does a jumping quick bite, rendering her body
horizontal way above Blizzard's Freeze Breath, she'll get frozen anyway.
So, what do you do when you opponent think's he's Ryu? Four other possible
options...

a)  Some parts of some moves are invulnerable to some attacks (sometimes
:). Moves such as Chaos' FoFury, Diablo's Torch, Sauron's Primal Scream, &
Talon's Slasher will allow projectiles to pass through or over your
character without hitting you. Teleports will let you avoid the projectile
completely. And then there's all the anti-projectile moves other than
Leaping Attacks...

b)  Depending on who you are, you can just fire a projectile to cancel
your opponent's projectile.  Some projectiles pass through some other
projectiles, though, so be warned!

c)  If your projectile doesn't cancel the opponent's projectile and you
still have some time, you can fire another projectile. The second
projectile will cancel your opponent's projectile! Diablo vs. Chaos is a
good example. This hasn't been tested on everyone, so it might not work
for some!

d) Some characters are can duck underneath some projectiles when they
crouch, or block low. For example, Vertigo can duck completely under
Blizzard's Freeze Breath if you hold the joystick straight down (not
down&back), while Diablo & others can duck completely underneath Sauron's
Stun Roar if they crouch or block low. On the other hand, no one can duck
underneath Chaos' Power Puke. Some characters' basic attacks (such as
Vertigo's crouching bites, or Talon's low claw attacks and slide kicks)
can hit a nearby projectile thrower without trading damage.

///4.3 Simultaneous Attack Collisions///

kuan@agames.com (Frank Kuan): writes:
Here's an interesting bit if info about version 2.3.
When SIMULTANEOUS collisions occur between normal (quick, fierce) and
power (two button), it follows this general formula:

1. quick wins over fierce
2. fierce beats power
3. power beats quick.

There are a few exceptions. An air attack done during a quick hop attack
has less priority than any other attack. On version 1.7, it was more
streetfighter'ish in the sense that any normal attack may have a "sweet
spot" where at the right range and timing, it would always beat anything
else. Version 2.3 was tuned so that "sweet spots" on normal and power
attacks were removed, so that simultaneous collisions would occur more
often and it would follow the arbitration rules of above. 

The beauty of the 3 rules of arbitration is that it GUARANTEES the
usefulness of every single normal/power attack in the game. It's like
rock/papers/scissors. If Talon uses air high power too much, you KNOW you
can beat him with any fierce attack. 

///4.4 Total Domination, Quick Kill, & Scoring///

4.4.1 Total Domination

In version 2.3, winning a "perfect" battle (i.e. without losing *any*
health, not even block-damage) is acknowledged as a "TOTAL DOMINATION."
These are not always as hard to get as one might think, especially in
certain matches vs the CPU (try repeatedly using Sauron's air 3, Air Throw
on CPU Diablo).

4.4.2 Quick Kill

A normal PR round lasts for 60 seconds. On version 2.3, vanquishing your
opponent in the first 10 seconds of the round merits a "QUICK KILL" award.
This is *much* harder to get than a TOTAL DOMINATION, though not
impossible (try swiftly & repeatedly using Diablo's standing 1+2 on CPU
Armadon, or stunning CPU Blizzard with five of Vertigo's standing 3+4s,
teleporting next to him, and finishing him off with a lethal combo). 

4.4.3 Scoring

     PR has a scoring system just like most other video games out there.
When the arcade game is in demo mode, you can bring up the high score
screen anytime by hold the joysticks toward one another. Hold the
joysticks away from each other to bring up the credits screen.
     If you beat the top score then you get to enter up to 15 letters, and
the character you played will crouch atop a shadowy hill (facing right if
you used the 1-player side, or left if you used the 2-player side)
whenever the scores are displayed. You have plenty of time to enter your
name, since the countdown begins with 20 seconds and renews to 15 seconds
every time you enter a letter, until it runs out or you enter the "end"
square.
     If your score is worthy of a 2nd through 10th place slot, then you
just get to enter three letters. On version 1.7, your name would be
completely eliminated from the roster if it were bumped off the top slot.
On version 2.3, the name in the top slot name is merely bumped to second
place by a higher score, and then only its first three letters are
visible.
     Note that the operator can allow only certain letter combinations in
the Full Name entry, if he wishes. The PR Censor has a default setting to
Strict, and if you enter a censored word it will be replaced by a string
of j's (except for the first letter).
     Unfortunately, you cannot see your score on the game screen during
your battles. In between battles, when the game shows you what area you
have just conquered, your score is represented by the "number of
worshipers" in the lower right-hand corner. The scores in the chart below
are for version 1.7, though I doubt they've been changed much for version
2.3...

Action                                    Worshipers/Points Awarded

bonus for winning without continuing              5,000,000 
     (these last three bonuses aren't cumulative)

///4.5 CPU AI patterns///

     The CPU AI in version 2.3 has been almost completely overhauled. From
the second battle on up, the CPU tends to use all its special moves more
(except fatalities, which it never does), more elaborate combos, and
cannot be as easily suckered with a constant barrage of attacks as before.
But in addition to its new strengths, the CPU has also gained new
weaknesses. Generally, you can win by anticipating and retaliating against
the CPU's tendency to jump and/or use special moves. Here are some very
brief weaknesses to exploit, if you want to rule the new Urth...

CPU Armadon

     Use anti-air moves or Armadon/Blizzard/Chaos/Talon's low 1+2 to hit
CPU Armadon out of the air when he jumps, which is very often. Block and
retaliate against his Mega Charge. He's also a sucker for Armadon's Mega
Charge, Diablo's Mega Lunge, and Chaos/Sauron's air Earthquake. Vertigo
can go for a low 1+2, Fast Venom Spit combo, or bite him out of the air
with her low 2 if she's far enough away, then do a Venom Spit as he gets
up. He'll probably either do the Iron Maiden or jump with a 4; she can
wait until after he swings his tail, knock him down with another bite, and
repeat. Use her air-to-air teleport to escape his corner-traps.
     Want to practice your ground combos? Knock Armie down and crouch next
to him. Wait for him to get up and try his tail-over-the-head attack. Then
nail him with a combo that begins with a low 1. Your low 1 is faster than
his attack; you'll hit him out of it and work him over! If you slip up and
attack too early, he'll just block your attempted combo, which is not as
much fun. ^_^
     Want to practice your air combos? Knock Armie down and toss a
projectile at him just as he gets up. If the projectile hits him, he'll
often do the Iron Maiden; jump straight up and pound him with a combo on
the way down.
     Armadon always starts his turn in the Final Battle with an off-screen
wail; then he leaps in with the Iron Maiden. 

CPU Blizzard

     Armadon and Vertigo can repeatedly swat him with their standing 3+4
from far enough away; Blizzard can repeatedly use the Short Mega Punch
followed by low 1s; Blizzard and Sauron can Air Throw him if he doesn't
Ice Geyser them first. Diablo and Sauron can chomp him with their standing
2 when he's just within their range; Chaos and Sauron can use their air
Earthquakes; Talon can get him with combos starting with a low 4 from a
short distance away. On home versions, Talon can do a low 4 out of range;
when Blizzard retaliates with an out-of-range Ice Geyser, Talon can close
in with the real attack. Characters with projectiles can knock Blizzard
down and toss a projectile so that it is in the middle of the screen (not
quite about to hit him) when he gets up. He'll long jump over it and do a
combo ending in a Mega Punch. Block the combo and retaliate with one of
your own. Everyone can long jump or hop jump back in the hope of suckering
Blizzard into a Mega Punch, duck/block the move, knock him down, and
repeat.
     Blizzard always starts his round in the Final Battle with the Freeze
Breath from off screen; then he jumps in.

CPU Chaos

     He almost always follows up his Power Puke or FoFury with either the
Battering Ram or the Flying Butt Slam. Block/dodge the moves and
retaliate. Armadon can jump in on him with air 4, air 3+4. Blizzard and
Sauron can repeatedly air throw him even if he's on the ground. Chaos and
Sauron can fall back on their air Earthquakes. Diablo can long-jump in
with air 3+4s; if he leaps from the right distance, Chaos will jump into
the attack, especially if Chaos is just getting up from a knockdown. Talon
can nail him by long-jumping in with combos that start with air 2, air
1+2. Vertigo can teleport to the ground on his opposite side and nail him
with a combo that starts with a low 1.
     Chaos always starts the Final Battle with the FoFury from off-screen
(block or long jump away to avoid it); then he leaps in with the Flying
Butt Slam.

CPU Diablo

     He tends to jump in response to your jumps. Leap toward him with your
air 3 or air 4 until you knock him down; then as he gets up, jump toward
him with an air throw or air combo, and he'll probably jump into it. The
key is not to do the air attack until after he jumps. Hang back when he
starts going crazy with out-of-range attacks, though, because he's about
to leap forward with his high-priority air 1+2. When you're getting up
from a knockdown, he likes to try a three-hit cross-up combo followed by
the Pulverizer. Block the combo, then jump and hit him out of the air.
     Diablo always starts the Final Battle with a roar from off screen
(his voice is more hoarse than Sauron's - probably a side effect of all
that smoking :); then he teleports in, appearing a short distance away.

CPU Sauron

     He likes to use his air Earthquake Stomp followed up with his
standing 1+2 a lot. When he goes for the Earthquake, long jump toward him
(avoiding the stomp) and combo him. He'll try walk up to you and bite you,
too; wait until he's in range and scratch him with low 1s.
     Sauron always starts the Final Battle with a roar from off screen.
Then he jumps straight down from above with an Earthquake Stomp, but this
particular earthquake won't damage you and he won't follow it up with his
standing 1+2. 

CPU Talon

     He has the most vicious of all the overhauled CPU AI's. He'll fall
for Armadon's Iron Maiden, Chaos' & Sauron's air Earthquakes, or Diablo's
air 3+4 a lot. Blizzard can tick block-damage off him with combos
involving the Fake Mega Punch. Talon can target his alter ego's backside
with the air 1+2. Everyone can hop jump toward him and make him block some
air attack(s). He'll frequently respond with his Slasher or a slide kick +
Frantic Fury combo; low block and quickly retaliate.
     Talon always starts the Final Battle with a yowl from off screen,
then jumps in with the Brain Basher. 

CPU Vertigo

     Like Diablo, she tends to jump in response to your jumps. If you jump
toward her with a high priority air attack(s) (such as Vertigo's 3+4, the
other lizards' 1+2, or the apes' 2 or 4) then she'll most likely leap into
it. This way, you can stun her with repeated combos like Armadon's air
1+2, 1+2; Sauron's air 1+2, Primal Scream; Talon's air 4, air 1+2;
Vertigo's air 4, air 3+4. Again, the key is not to attack until after she
leaves the ground. If her jumping bites hit you instead, then you probably
either jumped from the wrong distance or attacked too soon. She's
vulnerable to combos starting with a low 1 whenever she uses her
ground-to-ground teleport, and she almost never uses air teleports except
in response to certain special attacks, such as projectiles.
     Vertigo always starts the Final Battle with a hiss from off screen,
then teleports in, appearing on the ground a short distance away.

///4.6  Final Battle///

     After using one character to conquer all seven territories, the last
of which must be won from the CPU, you are awarded "WORLD DOMINATION." If
a second player joins in during the first six matches, beating him will
conquer the territory and ruler you otherwise would have fought, even if
the second player didn't use that character. If that's the case, though,
then you lose the opportunity to do a fatality on the ruler you didn't
fight. If a second player joins in while you are fighting for your seventh
territory, you must re-conquer the entire world after beating him. If you
join in during any match and beat the other player, you must conquer all
the other territories afterward, even if he conquered some of them and
you're using the same character as he did. You'll also have to re-conquer
the world if you lose a match and continue on the other side, or with a
different character (changing your character's color won't make a
difference though :).
     After winning WORLD DOMINATION, you arrive at a stage where you have
to fight all seven characters again in one big round, with the clock
turned off. This is called the "Final Battle." It takes place on a special
"Dinosaur Graveyard" stage. There are no worshipers or pterodactyls moving
about in the background. If you die during the Final Battle then you can
continue from the precise point at which you left off [the continue
countdown is 15 seconds instead of the usual 10], but you cannot change
characters and if a second player joins in the Final Battle ends (see
Final Battle Bugs in version 2.3).
       Fortunately, there are three ways to make the Final Battle easier.
The first is to do fatalities on as many opponents as you can (remember
that you can't do a fatality on an opponent if your second win is a "time
over" victory, or if you don't fight him because a second player has
joined in). Dead enemies will flicker like ghosts in the Final Battle, and
every attack you do to them will inflict extra damage. Regardless of
whether a given enemy is solid or flickering, the instant you exhaust his
health meter he will collapse and revert to bones, which become part of
the background. Unlike normal rounds, you can't finish a big combo if your
opponent expires in the middle of it. When an enemy dies, you stand still
and will remain frozen until you hear the voice of your next foe.
     The second advantage is to know each CPU foes' signature entrance,
anticipate it, and dodge or retaliate (signature entrances are described
in section 4.5, "CPU AI PATTERNS"). There are two ways to tell which
opponent you'll fight next. One is to watch for the name under the enemy's
health meter, which appears just as the battle starts. The other is to
listen for the enemy's voice (or projectile sound, for the apes). Each PR
character has a unique voice for their wordless battle cries/screams of
pain.
     Your third advantage is that before arriving at this stage, you have
a chance to acquire more than 100% total strength. The game will say "NOW
YOU MUST REPLENISH YOUR HEALTH BEFORE THE FINAL BATTLE," and a 20-second
bonus round commences. It takes place on the background of the last enemy
you beat, and all you do is eat worshipers and pterodactyls for more
strength. It is possible to obtain a maximum of 100% extra health, which
will appear in a green life meter after your red life meter has been
exhausted. You can eat both people & pterodactyls in the bonus round by
doing each character's 'Eat a worshiper' move, or use a normal bite to eat
just the pterodactyls. The humans are much more nutritious than the
pterodactyls, which give you a mere 1% health each. Even if you can't find
anything to eat, 18% extra health automatically trickles into your reserve
life bar. If the NO GORE switch has been set for PR, you won't be able to
eat people during the Bonus Round; instead, you automatically get 50%
extra health.

A little phrase pops up during this mini-round:

     Armadon - TO GIVE YOU STRENGTH FOR THE FINAL CONFRONTATION, YOUR
TRIBE SACRIFICES ITSELF TO YOU.
     Blizzard - NOW, DINE ON A FINE FEAST OF FOLLOWERS.
     Chaos - CHOW DOWN, IT'S A PAGAN PICNIC.
     Diablo - FEASTING FRENZY!
     Sauron - EAT OF YOUR TRIBE THAT YOU MIGHT REMAIN IMMORTAL.
     Talon - CHEW UP AS MANY HUMANS AS YOU CAN.
     Vertigo - SWALLOW THE TINY HUMANS WHOLE.

FINAL BATTLE BUG in ARCADE VERSION 1.7:

     At the mini-round, do NOT get 100% health. If you do, in the Final
Battle, when you lose your first 100% of health, you will NOT get the
health you earned in the mini-round. Your game will be over.

FINAL BATTLE BUGS in ARCADE VERSION 2.3:

1) Several times now, I've seen a second entire *red* life meter appear
after the first red life meter was used up, but before the green life
meter was started. Not to complain, but it was kind of weird... 

2) When Chaos' "signature entrance" FoFury cloud appears a short distance
behind you, do not hold the joystick toward it (i.e. don't back into it
while trying to block). The game will freeze, display a screenful of
incomprehensible numbers along with the words "press three times to
continue," and reset when you tap the buttons. It's happened to me on
several occasions with different characters, and this time I *am*
complaining. A simple way to avoid this glitch is to long jump away from
the FoFury when it appears, avoiding it and Chaos' Flying Butt Slam.

3) It is possible for a second player to join in during the Final Battle
on version 2.3. You'll fight your match on the dinosaur graveyard stage,
and the winner will get to re-conquer the world. Unfortunately, the game
will crash if/when you make it back to the Final Battle again. When this
happened to me, halfway through the Final Battle I heard Sauron's roar but
the game reset before he could show up.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
++++++++++++++++++++ 5. Endings+++++++++++++++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you defeat all seven opponents during the Final Battle, the
following words appear:

          [char name] CONQUERS
          CONGRATULATIONS 
          YOU ARE RULER 
          OF THE NEW URTH 

Your entire tribe of worshipers runs on screen to cheer your success. Then
comes a couple paragraphs of text about your character, followed by a
captioned picture. If your score is worthy of a place on the roster, you
get to enter your initials or full name and glimpse your score on the
king-of-the-hill demo screen.

///ARMADON///

     For over a million years, Armadon had lived peacefully in his cave
beneath the Earth's crust, telepathically linked to the biomass. The
Cataclysms and the battles for supremacy over the changing planet tortured
him. So he rose up to settle things once and for all.
     Now that the threat has past, he settles down into the ground to
enjoy some well deserved rest. The land is scarred but calm. At least for
now...

Followed by a picture of Armadon in a cave. His worshipers have built some
dwellings into the cave's walls; three women are climbing up various
ladders. Armadon sits in the middle of the cave meditating, with his eyes
closed. His body is outlined with electricity. 

Picture Caption:  THE MEDITATION OF ARMADON

///BLIZZARD///

      Blizzard is a noble god, the essence of the animal spirit. Frozen
for a millennia at the heart of an immense glacier in the Himalayas,
Blizzard was released when the Urth met the great meteor. He lived high in
the mountains, descending only when threatened. With his animal power and
age-old wisdom, he was unstoppable.
      With no threats remaining, he returns to his mountain retreat. One
day, though, a new force will invade his land from across the endless
ocean...

This text is followed by a picture depicting Blizzard sitting in an
ice-covered chair. He is calmly looks ahead, chin in hand. A man and two
women bow to him; a third woman leans against his throne.

Picture Caption:  BLIZZARD'S SOLITUDE

///CHAOS///

     Chaos was the mightiest witch doctor on the first continent. His
greatest wish was to control the evolution of humanity. In his quest for
power, he cast a mighty spell which backfired and turned him into a
disgusting beast, forced to wallow in his own excrement for eons. During
the Cataclysm, Chaos praised Throshti, God of Carrion, for release.
However, to restore his greatness, he had to defeat all of his enemies.
     Now, his task completed, he regains control of his life and leads his
tribe to greatness. One day, though, his people will be threatened and he
will have to pursue power again...

Followed by a picture of the human Chaos standing in an archway barely
illuminated by four burning torches. His left hand is on the back of an
almost completely nude woman, who hugs his side. A ghost-like figure of
his ape form is in the background darkness.

Picture Caption:  CHAOS' REDEMPTION

///DIABLO///

     Diablo is evil in its purest form. He was released from his fiery
prison, deep within the Urth, drawn by the pain and torment caused in the
great Cataclysms. Now that he has conquered the planet, he lives to
torture it. With none left to oppose him, he begins to burn the entire
planet, sparing only the cruel and vicious. He turns the world into a
living hell.
     For centuries he will revel in the inferno he has created, until at
last his rule is challenged by a traveler from across the great sea...

Followed by a picture of Diablo standing near a bloodstained gallows with
skeletons hanging from it. Two worshipers, a man and a woman, are at his
feet. They are apparently fighting for his enjoyment, each using a single
bone as a weapon. Bloody, crucified skeletons surround the de facto arena.
And you thought Shao Kahn was bad... ^_^

///SAURON///

     Sauron is the god of Hunger. When released from his sleep of ages by
the catastrophe, he soon realized that he must devour human flesh to
remain immortal. The hungry hordes of humanity worshiped him, but lived in
dread fear of his presence. Many humans soon sought refuge with other
rulers of the planet. Sauron had no choice but to defeat the others in
order to feast on their followers. Now that he has devoured most of the
land, he sets off in quest of new lands and new meals...

This text is followed by a awesomely sick picture. It depicts Sauron
standing on the beach next to humongous piles of eaten bodies. Faint
images of faraway carrion birds fly above his banquet. A dead body hangs
from Sauron's teeth. In the foreground is a mostly eaten, fleshless body,
and Jason Leong (a PR creator/artist :) with his skull broken open and
brains spilling out (the brains are censored from the picture in the PR
Players Guide!). The sky is dark red-orange from a brilliant setting sun.
There are no living worshipers.

Picture Caption:  THE FEAST OF SAURON

///TALON///

      For eons, Talon was a great chief of a raptor clan on a hidden South
Pacific island. When the great meteor rearranged the continents, Talon's
island was brought in contact with the mainland. Wanting to ensure the
safety of his wives and children, he set off to eliminate all dangers of
the clans welfare.
      Now raptors live a life of luxury, and humans are kept as cattle or
hunted as sport while raptors lounge about in the sunshine. His clan is
completely safe and Talon will be happy until the newcomers arrive...

Followed by a picture of Talon and two smaller raptors without crests
reclining human-style on a grassy hill, under a budding tree. The lounging
raptors are overlooking a wooden cattle-style pen containing at least six
worshipers, male and female, two of whom are running from a raptor with a
big net. Outside the pen, two more men flee across the plains from another
pair of raptors.

Picture Caption:  TALON'S DREAM

///VERTIGO///

      Long ago a sorceress named Vertigo appeared from another dimension.
Then in a great magical battle during the Mesozoic Wars, Vertigo was
banished to the moon by the arch mage Balsa Fas. The meteor crash,
however, has weakened the old shields enough for her to return and enslave
the planet once again.
     Reveling in her victory, Vertigo has enslaved hordes of humans,
having them build her an insane palace in multiple dimensions. Few minds
can endure the torture, but there are plenty of humans. One day while
practicing her arcane arts, she discovers a land where she is not queen...

Followed by a picture of a forward-facing Vertigo looking up and hissing
in the middle of some purple swirls. She is standing at a 45-degree angle
with her left foot upraised. She is covered with horizontal stripes (!),
and her hood is framed with jagged points. A man and a woman in the
foreground are covering their ears. In the background are three
Escher-style stairways with tired-looking humans walking up or down them.

///6.1  Colors!!!///

 In version 2.3, all characters come in four colors. You choose your color
when you select your character. Pick your character by holding down either
button 2, button 3, button 4 or no other buttons as you press button 1. 1
is the Original Recipe color; 1+2 is the old alternate color; 1+3 and 1+4
are new colors. The CPU is always the Original Recipe or old alternate
color. Should you and another player choose the same character with the
same color, then the one who chose the color in dispute first gets to keep
it. The late chooser is stuck with the Original Recipe color unless that
was the color in dispute, in which case he's stuck with the old alternate
color.
     Each character also has a particular color for their conquered
territory/worshipers' clothing. In a character vs same character match,
the other set of worshipers have a slightly different clothing color.

Armadon  
   1=ochre&brown 1+2=green&olive 1+3=purple ("Barney Armadon" :)
1+4=yellow
   Territory, worshiper's clothing color: neon green
   Alternate worshiper's clothing color: olive

Blizzard  
   1=dark blue&brown 1+2=cyan&gray 1+3=green&gray 1+4=silver&white
   Territory, worshiper's clothing color: blue
   Alternate worshiper's clothing color: dark blue

Chaos 
   1=pink&grey 1+2=lilac&grey 1+3=green&pink 1+4=green&purple
   Territory, worshiper's clothing color: yellow
   Alternate worshiper's clothing color: dark yellow

Diablo 
   1=red&black 1+2=orange&red 1+3=green&red 1+4=dark olive&brown
   Territory, worshiper's clothing color: red
   Alternate worshiper's clothing color: orange

Sauron 
   1=yellow&purple 1+2=fluorescent yellow&blue 1+3=fluorescent
yellow&cinnamon  1+4=purple&black ("Barney the King")
   Territory, worshiper's clothing color: purple
   Alternate worshiper's clothing color: dark purple

Talon 
   1=orange 1+2=orange-yellow 1+3=lilac ("Son of Barney") 1+4=white 
   (Talon always has black stripes and white crest/underbelly/feet.)
   Territory, worshiper's clothing color: white
   Alternate worshiper's clothing color: gray

Vertigo 
   1=blue&cyan 1+2=green&aquamarine 1+3=green&yellow 1+4=green&purple
("Bride of Barney")
   Territory, worshiper's clothing color: aqua
   Alternate worshiper's clothing color: light green

///6.2  Cheeze Alert///

Are you sick and tired of your opponent yelling, "That's cheezey!"? Well,
PR has it's own cheeze alert! If you do something that the _game_ thinks
is too cheezey, it will flash a "No Cheeze" sign. When this happens the
victim will not be hurt or stunned by the cheeze, and if the cheezey move
was part of a combo, it does not count as a combo hit and the cheezey
combo ends. This feature was added as a conscious attempt to prevent the
inescapable traps that have been known to plague other fighting games. No
sign, no cheeze. End of argument. =)

Known Cheeze Alerts:
   Attempted throw or unblockable attack immediately after a blocked
attack (while opponent is trapped in "block-stun")
   Attempt to use same special move twice in a combo (slow & fast
projectiles are considered to be two different special moves)
   Attempt to use the same basic move more than five times in a combo
   Two low 3+4s in a combo 
   Both Blizzard's Freeze Breath and Ice Geyser in a combo
   Three of Blizzard's 1+2s in a combo
   Three of Chaos' 1+2s in a combo
   Two of Diablo's air 1+2s in a combo
   Two of Diablo's air 3+4s in a combo
   Two of Sauron's air 1+2s in a combo
   Two of Sauron's air 3+4s in a combo 
   Two of Talon's low 3s in a combo
   Two of Talon's low 4s in a combo (version 2.3 only)
   Both Vertigo's Come Slither and Voodoo Spell in a combo
   Vertigo teleporting in, doing a combo, then teleporting out

Note: On version 1.7, one could string Talon's low 4s together in a combo
by doing a low 4, interrupting it with the Run Backwards move, immediately
doing another low 4, and so on. Since Talon's low 4 has a long range and
relatively little knockback, one could string five of them together at any
time for a nasty combo (in comparison, most other Fierce attacks will
knock the enemy out of range after one to three hits). The version 2.3
programmers fixed this trap by making two of Talon's low 4s in a combo
cheezey. Even so, Talon's SLIDER combo names require two low 4s in a
combo, so to get the SLIDER names you must also get a No Cheeze meter!
Talon's low 3 is presumably similar; it has so little knockback that it
would be too easy to string five of them together anytime, so two of them
in a combo was officially made cheezey.

///6.3  Eat a Worshiper/// 

   Eating people is fun and easy! In version 2.3, worshipers taste better
and are more filling!  They now give significant energy bonuses, so chow
down. Each character has a special move JUST TO EAT PEOPLE, and they're
all different. See the moves section to find out how. Ordinary bites will
just knock humans into the air, and you can't eat 'em unless they're on
the ground. It does take a moment to eat, so be careful - if your opponent
isn't distracted or stunned, he may bop you and send your dinner flying!
During a normal match, your worshipers will run into the foreground (where
you can eat them!) whenever you do a combo or get dizzy. The best way to
eat your opponent's followers is to get him dizzy, wait for his followers
to rush forward, trip him with your low 3+4, and combo the attack into
your Chomp a Human special move. You can also eat your own worshipers
after doing a combo that knocks your opponent down, but remember that
eating your own tribe will cost you points!

If you're having trouble pursuing & accidentally bopping your dinner
during the Bonus Round, keep 3+4 held down all the time, from before the
round starts. Your character can walk back and forth with these buttons
held down. When you're in the right position to eat your dinner, hold down
1+2 as well (even if you do a standing bite by accident, it probably won't
disturb the humans) and then move the joystick. You can eat pterodactyls
only during the Bonus Round, by using either the Chomp a Human move or any
High Attack.

There are six different tribespeople, three men and three women:


Appearance                                  Name          %Health on rev
1.7, and rev 2.3

pterodactyls (Bonus Round only)  --                 1%, 1%
woman with short black hair         Jeanette        3%, 10%
woman with long blond hair         Tracy            4%, 12%
woman with long black hair          Renee           4%, 12%
bald man with spear                      Jason            6%, 13%
muscular man with short hair        Ron              8%, 16%
fat man with dreadlocks                Rob              12%, 21%

The number of worshipers you see on screen is a representation of the
total number of worshipers/points you've accumulated divided by 50,000,
fractions rounded down, maximum of ten of your followers on screen at a
time (except after winning the Final Battle). There are always at least
three tribespeople on screen at the start of a round, even if they were
all eaten last round. The higher your score is, the greater the
probability of having meatier worshipers on screen, which is especially
helpful during the Bonus Round before the Final Battle.

Some characters eat worshipers faster than others.  Blizzard, for example,
takes his time chomping on a human & spits out the bones, while Talon just
stuffs 'em in his mouth.

Fastest eaters:  Diablo, Sauron, Talon
Medium eaters: Armadon, Vertigo
Slowest eaters:  Blizzard, Chaos

In addition to being eaten, your worshipers have different reactions to
various things during a fight. Even if they all get eaten during a match,
you'll still hear the cheers 'n' stuff from their off-screen comrades.

     You move around --> Tribe runs back and forth, following you
     You get hit --> Tribe is sad
     You hit your opponent --> Tribe cheers
     Do a combo that has three or more hits, <35% damage and doesn't end
in a special move --> Crowd cheers: YIP! YIP! or ALRIGHT!
     Do a combo that does <35% damage and ends in a special move --> Crowd
cheers: YYEECCHH! or YYEEAAHH! or EEEWWW!
     Do Blizzard's Air Throw, Chaos' FoFury or Ground Shaker, Sauron's Air
Throw or Earthquake Stomp --> Both tribes fall down, then get back up
     Win a round --> Crowd cheers, does victory dances
     Lose a round --> Crowd is dejected; women weep, men stomp their feet
     Win a match --> Your tribe chases enemy tribe away
     You get dizzy --> Tribe members run forward and pray to you for help
     You do a combo --> As many tribe members as hits in your combo (up to
maximum of all your tribe present) run forward and worship your power
     Armadon does 5+ hit combo ending in Hornication Uppercut, or Vertigo
does 5+ hit combo ending in Come Slither --> Naked, inedible worshipers
dash across the screen
     Hit a tribesperson --> Person goes flying
     Eat a pterodactyl (Bonus Round only) --> Pterodactyl cries Ah-RAW!
and disappears in a tiny spatter of blood
     Eat a tribesperson --> Crowd goes EEEWWW. Victim screams AIEEEEEE!
(female) or UAAAAGH! (male). Tastes like chicken! ^_^

///6.4  Going ballistic///

This feature occurs only in player vs. player matches. On version 1.7 &
presumably 2.3 as well, each character goes ballistic if he/she

1) Has 50% less health than the opponent
2) Has less than 30% health left
3) The character gets hit out of a special move, tripped by a low 3+4 or
certain special moves, thrown, or hit out of the air (i.e. gets knocked
down)

The wounded character's brain meter crackles as if telegraphing a stun,
but when they get up they start flickering (the character constantly
switches between the current color and the Original Recipe, or else the
Original Recipe and the old alternate) and go into the ballistic state.
The character announces this state with a brief, recycled piece of
animation during which they can't hurt or be hurt by their opponent (like
the "full POW meter" animations in Samurai Shodown II). In the ballistic
state, all your attacks do significantly more damage. You can tell if you
are in that state if your character is flickering and has one of these
words under your character's name.

     Armadon - SAMADHI [Bed-o'-Nails animation]
     Blizzard - ZEN [Ice Geyser animation]
     Chaos - INSANE [Power Puke animation]
     Diablo - STEAMED [Incinerator fatality animation]
     Sauron - RAMPAGING [Primal Scream animation]
     Talon - BERSERK [Frantic Fury animation]
     Vertigo - RABID [hood flare from victory animation]

On version 1.7 and probably 2.3 as well, going ballistic has the following
effects:

1) your attacks do 40% more damage than usual [fractions are rounded down]
2) you receive 15% less damage from any attack
3) you take zero block-damage
4) you have no combo regulation (combos are normally regulated so that
after a certain number of hits, each successive hit does only so much
damage)
5) you can stay ballistic for 20 clock ticks at the most

In tug-of-war mode (where both dinos share one big lifebar, available on
some home versions of PR) it is possible, albeit unlikely, for both
players be ballistic at the same time.

///6.5 Sudden Death & the Clock///

   A PR match is best two out of three rounds. Round one is "First Blood,"
round two is "Vengeance", and round three [if there is one] is
"Domination." Each of these rounds begins when the announcer says "RAGE!"
and lasts for up to sixty seconds. The last ten seconds are accompanied by
shrill cricket chirps, as a reminder that you're running out of time. If
the two of you still have health left by the end of the round, you'll both
be knocked down. Then the one with the most energy will get back up; the
other guy will stay flat on his back. This is a "time over" victory, which
is announced with the words "[char name] WINS." You'll also see "[char
name] WINS" when either character gains his first victory, time over or
not. 
     A "decisive" victory, in which you completely exhaust your opponent's
health meter, will fry his brain meter and explode his heart meter. If
your first victory is decisive, he'll keel over in an "I lost" animated
sequence. If your second win is a decisive victory, then he'll be stunned
for a few moments while you can try a fatality. Should you not do the
fatality correctly, or hit him with any move by accident, he'll keel over
again. In any case, you'll see the words "[char name] CONQUERS." Note that
if your second victory is a time over win, you won't have the opportunity
to perform a fatality. Your current victories are represented near your
life meter with a little claw-symbol.
     A draw in PR is announced with the words "DEAD EVEN" and does not
count as a win for either contestant. If the third round ends without a
clear winner [both characters have zero wins, or one win each], you both
get knocked down and go immediately into a "Sudden Death" round as you get
up. This round lasts for only 30 seconds [20 seconds on version 1.7] and
has a meteor shower thrown in.  Both players begin with a full bar of
health. As the round progresses, each players' health automatically
decreases at a steady rate and both fight as usual until one loses.
Whoever wins the Sudden Death round wins the match, and has the usual
opportunity to perform a fatality on the loser.
     Since both characters' energy bars are empty by the end of the 30
seconds, neither character can get a "time over" victory during Sudden
Death. If Sudden Death ends in a draw, then both opponents lose and you
lose your credit. During the continue countdown, instead of one victorious
critter & one unconscious critter, you'll see both contestants lying
unconscious, side by side.
</pre><pre id="faqspan-4">
///6.6  Secrets - Volleyball, Bowling, Raining Cows 'n' Stuff///

6.6.1  Volleyball

When you and an opponent are on Sauron's stage, have one player do a combo
on the other. Once you do this, worshipers will run out and start bowing.
Have one player who is close to the worshiper hit him. The worshiper
should bounce over to the other player. Before the worshiper lands, have
the other player hit the worshiper back. After bouncing the worshiper back
and forth ten times, a judge on a high chair and a net will pop up and the
round clock stop. You and your opponent can now play volleyball with a
helpless human! Once a player reaches a score of three, you resume
fighting. You can eat the "ball" too. With Vertigo, I ate the ball twice
when I hit quick bite! I lost the point because of that!

6.6.2  Bowling

On any stage, have two Armadon players continuously execute the Spinning
Death on each other.  After three Spinning Death collisions, the players
bowl two frames! Ten worshipers will get into a bowling pin formation and
let you roll over them with the Spinning Death.

6.6.3 Raining Cows 'n' Stuff! [confirmed by jdavis@iglou.com (Jason
Davis)]

Mentioned in the "Primal Rage Arcade Player's Guide" by the guys at
GamePro. Play as Chaos in his home stage (the Ruins). Arrange for a Sudden
Death round to take place (see below). If you do a FoFury so that the
green cloud is in the air as the Sudden Death begins, the sky will rain
cows instead of meteors. If you don't do an FoFury on Chaos' stage, the
sky will rain bricks. If Sudden Death occurs on Blizzard's stage, the sky
will rain ice balls. This feature doesn't seem to be in SNES PR (which is
also missing the standard meteor shower during Sudden Death).

///6.7 Free Play!///

When you have to pay for your game, putting less than 1 credit in a PR
machine makes the sound of a cricket chirp, and putting 1 credit in makes
a pterodactyl cry. But you'll know that a PR 2.3 machine has been set to
"free play" if the words DEMO ONLY appear near the top of the screen. Free
play mode is a great opportunity to practice your combos! Player vs.
player battles work as usual, but you can't lose to the CPU. All CPU
opponents will fight as if they were the first enemy on a normal
difficulty setting; what's more, you can't lose energy! No matter how many
times the CPU bites you, you'll get a TOTAL DOMINATION with every match
(and you can still enter your score at the end like usual)! I'm pretty
sure this wasn't the case for the free play setting on version 1.7; can
anyone confirm?

///6.8  PR version///

To check what version of PR your arcade has, push up on the left joystick
and pull down on the right simultaneously, during the title screen. The
"production version" is 1.7. If you have a beta version, bug your arcade
owner to get it updated! The "Hot New Version 2" that Atari has made a
spiffy Blizzard sign for is 2.3, and has "Version 2.3" on the title screen
in big letters made of bones. It has many features that will turn various
players on or off, depending...

Not-so-brief list of version 2.3 changes:

-demo mode intro text has letters made of bones instead of black letters
-one new fatality for each character added
-eating humans adds much more energy to your health meter
-100% health bug from ver 1.7 fixed
-gameplay speed changed
     Diablo, Sauron, most leaping attacks, most projectiles sped up
     Armadon, Blizzard, Talon slowed down
-Simultaneous attack collisions tuned: "sweet spots" removed,
quick->fierce->power->quick "round robin" priority system added
-little SF2-style "Christmas Lights" added; they flash with every strike,
blocked or not
-gone are the faint "blue shields" that used to appear when blocking
attacks
-generally, damage to heart & brain meters decreased, but block-damage to
heart increased 
-block-damage usually won't kill you
-if you're on the ground, projectiles don't knock you down anymore
-combo names, Total Domination, Quick Kill features added
-Sudden Death lasts for 30 seconds instead of 20
-hop jumps can now be used vs the CPU
-CPU's "AI" patterns changed; many old tricks no longer work, but some new
tricks do
-"fatality"/"no fatality" music added; other music enriched w/more
percussion
-a previous high score drops to 2nd when beaten
-In free play mode, the words "DEMO ONLY" appear & CPU can't hurt you 
-all Leaping Attacks can be blocked 
-all Stomps can be blocked and/or done in the air
-Armadon's Spinning Death and Mega Charge don't go under projectiles
anymore
-Armadon can volley his victim after the Mega Charge
-Blizzard's Freeze Breath inflicts damage; Freeze Breath & Ice Geyser
don't last as long
-Chaos' Battering Ram makes an annoying new sound
-Chaos' Cannonball finishing move can kill enemies on any stage 
-Diablo's Torch combos more easily
-Diablo's Inferno Flash can be blocked
-Talon's low 4 is cheezey to use twice in a combo
-Talon can attack (or be attacked) as he rebounds from the Brain Basher
-Talon's Pounce & Flip does no block-damage
-Talon's Shredder fatality made gorier
-Vertigo has a new teleport, and can do both old & new teleports in the
air

///6.9 NEW UPGRADE is not coming. :-(///

Another update for Primal Rage was scheduled for Jan '95. It was supposed
to add a boss character; the December '94 issue of GamePro magazine had a
tantalizing silhouette of who the new Rage boss might have been. He looked
like a horned dracolich [animate dragon skeleton], with three claws on
each limb and three spines on the end of his tail. GamePro's sources
mentioned rumors that the boss would have been capable of flight and
possessed an energy-siphoning power. But, alas...

John Bailon, Southern Hills Golfland (H20ORSNO@aol.com) writes:
>FYI, Atari/TWI decided to scrap the second update PR that was slated for
release early this year.  It seems that too many operators complained that
the 2.3 update actually made their collections worse and went back to the
original version 1.

///7.1 PR is coming to eleven home systems! Quick List.///

dlenna@micro.ti.com (Dmitri Lenna) passes on some very interesting
information from Intelligent Gamer Online:

>[Ed. We contacted Tracy Egan at Time Warner Interactive regarding Primal
Rage and T-MEK, and here's what we learned for you: coding of some Primal
Rage translations began when the arcade games were still in their first
(1.x) revisions, but the programmers went back and retroactively added
features to the 1.7 code to improve it. As a result, several of the
versions (namely the Genesis and handheld games) will be "hybrids,"
drawing features from 1.7 and 2.3 where appropriate. The SNES and
next-generation versions, on the other hand, will all use Primal Rage
version 2.3 code, as we were told that those systems would better be able
to handle it.

per God, combo names, Easter Eggs, new animated sequences, new play modes
   32X: 4 MB, 7 Gods, people, 70+ moves, 8-9 special moves (2 fatalities)
per God, no combo names, Easter Eggs, no new stuff
   Saturn: 250 MB, 7 Gods, people, 70+ moves, 9 special moves (3
fatalities) per God, new animated sequences, Easter Eggs

There used to be plans for Mac CD PR, but they've been scrapped. :-(

Easter Eggs: Look for arcade favorites plus new cheat modes.

  On a side note if I may.. the Megs refers to MegaBytes; video game
companies for some reason or another use MegaBits. Video game magazines
have will the SNES and Genesis versions listed at 24 megs, and the 32X  at
32 megs. GB will be 1 Meg and GGear will be 2. As for the CDROMs, I  don't
imagine those are exact, but as an old high school physics teacher used to
say "Close enough for Government work" :).

///7.2 Brief descriptions of PR for various systems///

I've had hands-on experience with only the arcade, SNES, Genesis, IBM PC,
and PSX versions of PR. All the information I have on the other versions
is gathered from magazines, newsgroups, e-mail from helpful PR fans, etc.

7.2.1 Game Boy/Game Gear PR

A great deal has been lost in the translation, including long jumps/hop
jumps, many moves & fatalities, combo names, and poor Vertigo. The
remaining special moves are done differently than in the arcade. Consult
the PR for Game Boy/Game Gear movelist to find out how. We've finally
found Diablo's fatality, and do let me know if any of the other moves are
incorrect! Most of the moves are from published PR guidebooks, but the
guides aren't always right (they got Diablo's fatality and a few others
wrong). As far as we know, all special moves & fatalities are done exactly
the same for either GB or GG PR.
    There are a couple differences between GB and GG PR. Chaos' Golden
Shower fatality is as normal in GG PR, but GB PR changed/censored it to
some kind of "acid spit" effect (more evidence of Nintendo's
squeamishness). And of course, GG PR is in color while GB PR is in black
and white.

7.2.2 SNES PR 

Overall, PR for the Super Nintendo is a decent translation of arcade PR
2.3. All basic moves, special moves, & fatalities are there, but Chaos'
Golden Shower fatality is censored. When you do the Golden Shower, Chaos
just stands there and a censor sign (the No Cheeze meter without the
cheeze) appears. When you do Chaos' Churl...

peter.bott@swcbbs.com (PETER BOTT) writes:
>i've seen chaos suck the churl in, and i've seen it go by him or not even
reach him too.  it all depends on where chaos is on the screen when he
does the fatality.  

     Unfortunately, some moves (especially fatalities) are hard to do on
standard SNES control pads. A Capcom joystick works OK; C&L arcade-quality
joystick is reportedly the best kind. SNES PR's other disadvantages
include the lack of combo names, increased knockback (so that a few arcade
combos don't work), and you can only reconfigure the buttons to one of
twelve pre-set options, instead of being able to assign any basic attack
to any button. 
    There is a sound test mode you can access anytime, and a cheat menu
you can access with a code. BTW the instruction manual incorrectly says
you must be at least difficulty level 7 to reach the Bonus Round/Final
Battle. You actually have to play at difficulty level 10 (the factory
default) or higher to reach the Bonus Round/Final Battle.

7.2.3 Genesis PR 

This cart is quite inferior to the SNES version, and the PC version tops
'em both. Genesis PR's graphics and sound are of course poorer. The
characters lack all the new moves and fatalities that were added to arcade
version 2.3. There are no combo names. Worst of all, many more arcade
combos are missing for no good reason. Sauron cannot chain two 1s
together, Talon cannot chain a low 1 into a low 4, etc. It isn't a
question of knockback; the combos simply don't work. There is a "Training
Mode" play option, where you can fight one match against the CPU opponent
of your choice; big whoop. There is also a cheat menu you can access with
a code.
    Genesis PR does have one advantage over SNES PR. Unlike SNES PR,
Genesis PR lets you reconfigure your controller as you please, and assign
any basic attack to any controller button. 

7.2.4 PR for the IBM PC CD-ROM 

IMHO, this is possibly the best translation out there. It easily surpasses
the SNES/Genesis/GB/GG versions. The graphics are excellent. The music &
sound effects have been completely redone, and are OK - though on my sound
card, some of the background music can hardly be recognized as the tunes
from the arcade. Best of all, there are combo names! At this time, the
only home-system translations known to have combo names are PR for the IBM
PC and Sony Playstation.
    In IBM PC PR, special moves are done differently on the
keyboard/2-button joystick than in the arcade. If you use a four-button
joystick, all special moves are the same as in the arcade. I recommend
getting a Gravis four-button PC joystick, which is amazingly cheap ($25 or
less). With the Gravis joystick in hand, the gameplay control is quite
satisfactory; I can do my 14+ hit combos just fine. You can reconfigure
your keyboard/joystick controls as you please. 
   There is some load time off the CD before the start a match (or in the
Final Battle/elimination play modes, when a new dino jumps in). It isn't
very long (20 seconds max?), unless you used the "small install" option to
squeeze PR onto your PC. There's a shorter pause when the game loads
fatalities. During the actual gameplay, load time is almost nonexistent.
There's a brief pause when you first eat a human, but not much else.
   PR for the IBM PC offers two new play modes: tug-of-war, where both
critters share one big life bar (like the Death Match mode of World Heroes
:), and elimination, where each player picks several dinos. There is no
new animation for the intro/ending sequences, though. 
   There are few glitches. One of the more noticeable is that Vertigo's
low 3+4 has almost zero range, even though her tail covers half the
screen(???). Another, more serious glitch is that IBM PR does not run on
everyone's computer. I never had any trouble with my version 1.0, but
other people had their version 1.2 of the game locking up. Fortunately,
there is a patch to fix this problem at

You can download the file prr16pat.zip (506K) or the uncompressed version
prr16pat.exe (~1.2MB). Thanks to reike@munch.uni-paderborn.de (Burkhard
Reike) for telling us about it.

	For more info on PR for the PC (including all keyboard moves),
consult the PR for IBM PC FAQ.

7.2.5 32X PR

Like Genesis PR, 32X PR is a translation of the earlier arcade version
1.7. That means all the new moves & fatalities added in version 2.3 aren't
there. No combo names, either. :-( There is a cheat menu, and we finally
have the right code to access it.

7.2.6 3DO PR

PR for the 3DO has brand-new animated intro sequences, plus the option of
tug-of-war and endurance play modes. There are no combo names. The
character animation is reportedly quite well-done, although the sprites
are a little smaller than the PSX version. There seems to be at least one
bug:

anstey@sun.soe.clarkson.edu (Charles Anstey) writes:
>I was playing as Vertigo against the computer and performed a fatality
against Chaos.  When I got to the final battle, I had to fight Chaos
first.  This is where the bug is.
   The first time, I got hit at the start with his FoFury cloud and I 
disappeared from the screen, not teleporting, and never came back. Chaos
just kept jumping and attacking where I used to be but he never hit me and
I couldn't do anything.  RESET. The second time, I was able to avoid the
starting fart cloud, but 10 seconds later I did the Voodoo Spell and then
I just disappeared. Chaos again continued attacking where I used to be,
but I was gone permanently. RESET.  
   It seems that if you are playing Vertigo (I haven't tried any others
yet), and do a fatality on Chaos, and have to fight him first in the final
battle, Vertigo will disappear and never reappear for no apparent  reason.


7.2.7 Jaguar CD PR

Jaguar CD PR reportedly has somewhat smoother animation than PSX PR, the
trade-off being that Jaguar PR has smaller sprites. Elimination (both
players pick several dinos) and tug-of-war (both players share one big
lifebar) play modes are included. There is no new intro/ending animation.
No combo names, either. The combo system is reportedly altered (read:
"screwed up"); some arcade combos don't work on the Jaguar, and
vice-versa.
   When playing this game, don't confuse the numbers on the Jaguar joypad
with the numbers we use to describe the moves. In this FAQ, numbers refer
to the different attack buttons. Like all CD translations, Jaguar CD PR
has a certain amount of load time.

7.2.8 PSX PR

PR for the Sony Playstation has brand-new animated intro (but no animated
ending sequences), plus the option of tug-of-war play mode (where both
dinos share one big lifebar). This just in - PSX PR does indeed have combo
names!!! At this time, the only home-system translations known to have
combo names are PR for the IBM PC and Sony Playstation. The PSX character
sprites are very large, about 90% of arcade size, though some animation
frames are reportedly missing. 

I now own PSX PR, and I can report that the CPU AI is tougher, too. It was
disappointing not to see any rendered endings (PSX Tekken 2 spoiled me, I
guess), and the intro really didn't have enough dinos in it for my tastes
(just Sauron & Talon, and you don't see very much of 'em.) Here's a brief
description of the new animated intro:

Gameboy@ix.netcom.com (William Longworth) writes:
>There is a sequence showing a comet striking an asteroid, which sends a
hail of meteors down on the Earth. The meteors smash into buildings and
generally wreck the joint. There is then a sequence showing Sauron and
Talon squaring off in the rubble of a burning city (near a strangely
well-preserved auto). There is no fighting, just edging around each other.
The whole thing concludes with a blurry still and a cut to the arcade
title screen.  
   Most of the effects are badly done in the intro, and the characters
look like the victims of bad morph targets or really clumsy skeletal
deformation. They look better standing still than moving.  

7.2.9 Saturn PR

It hit the store shelves a while ago. According to the 1996 EGM2 "fighting
games special" (with Reptile on the cover), Saturn PR has the same new
cinematic into sequence as PSX PR, and *new cinematic endings*! There's
even a picture or two or Armadon in the hollows, and Chaos beating his
chest. It would appear that Saturn PR is the only version with cinematic
endings. The Easter Eggs (bowling, volleyball, skydiving cows) are
supposed to be in there, and the chars should have all their version 2.3
moves. No word on the no play modes, but they're almost certainly included
too.

/// 7.3 SNES, Genesis, 32X Cheat Codes & menus///

The SNES cheat code is courtesy of GamePro's "Primal Rage Official
Player's Guide" for SNES, Genesis, GB & GG, written by John Fisher with
Allan McGraw! I've tested this code on my SNES, and it works. To access
the cheat menu on SNES PR, press the following sequence on the control pad
at the Start/Options screen (L = Left, R = Right):

L, L, L, R, R, L, L, R, R, R, L, R

A "Cheats" option will appear. Selecting it brings up the following menu:

///The SNES Cheat Menu///

   Plr 1   1 Hit Wins - one hit kills player 2 (all player 1's attacks
inflict 100% damage, even special moves that don't normally hurt his
opponent)
   Plr 2   1 Hit Wins 
   Plr 1   Invulnerability - player 1 doesn't suffer health damage when
attacked (unless the 1 Hit Wins cheat is activated for player 2)
   Plr 2   Invulnerability
   Freeplay - you get unlimited continues
   Silent Turbo Mode - you can play the game at turbo speed, but without
sound
______

The Primal Rage Official Player's Guide incorrectly implies that the SNES
cheat code works on PR for the Sega Genesis. The true Genesis cheat code
has been published in the January 1996 issue of GamePro magazine. I've
tested this code on my Genesis, and it works. To access the "Extra
Options" cheat menu on Genesis PR, press the following sequence on the
control pad at the Start/Options screen (L = Left, R = Right, U = Up):

L, U, R, R, U, L, R, R, L, L, U

The March '96 issue of GamePro incorrectly implies that you can gain
access to the "Extra Options" cheat menu on 32X PR simply by putting the
curser on "Start" at the Start/Options screen. We finally have the *real*
32X PR cheat code, thanks to Steven Yau (sky21@ix.netcom.com). At the
"start" option, do

       L, R, U, D, D, U, R, L

The Genesis & 32X cheat menus are almost exactly the same. The only
difference is the 32X cheat menu doesn't have the "Okay, Right?" option,
which doesn't seem to do anything in Genesis PR anyway. 

///The Genesis/32X Cheat Menu///

   Freeplay - you get unlimited continues
   No Damage to PL1 - player 1 doesn't suffer health damage when attacked
   No Damage to PL2
   No Dizzy Damage to PL1 - player 1 doesn't suffer dizzy damage when
attacked
   No Dizzy Damage to PL2
   One Hit Kills PL1 - one hit kills player 1
   One Hit Kills PL2
   One Hit Dizzies PL1 - one hit makes player 1 dizzy
   One Hit Dizzies PL2
   Disable Countdown - the end-of-battle countdown is eliminated
   Disable PAUSED Message - the pause message is erased when you pause the
game
   Soak Test - in demo mode, the CPU repeatedly fights whole matches
against itself
   Start at Feast Round - the game starts at the Bonus/Feast Round, just
before the Final Battle
   Play Bowling Game - take a wild guess. ^_^
   Okay Right? - I don't think this does anything(?) It isn't in the 32X
cheat menu.
   Disable Extra Options - takes away the Extra Options menu until you
re-enter the cheat code
   DONE! - Takes you back to Start/Options screen

///7.4 PR pulled from the store shelves?!?///

The June '96 issue of GamePro confirms what has been disbelievingly
shunted about the net: one outraged mother managed to get Primal Rage
pulled from store shelves across the country. 
   Ellie Rovella of Gilbert, Arizona became incensed when her 11-year-old
son bought and played Genesis PR, using GamePro's strategy guide to
execute Chaos' Golden Shower fatality (in which Chaos kills his opponent
with his acidic urine). Rovella was so outraged she not only returned the 
game, but also launched a grass-roots campaign with the following results:
Target has removed Primal Rage from 22 stores, and Best Buy has pulled it
from 251 stores all over the country. Rovella has established an
800-number to spread the word and protested to several US senators.

GamePro ProNews writes:
   "Time Warner Interactive, maker of the game, points out some key facts
in its response to the boycott. First, it maintains that Rovella never
contacted TWI directly and instead immediately took her fight to the
media. When contacted by unhappy consumers, TWI tries to satisfy them and
often reimburses them, but Rovella never gave TWI a chance to plead its
case. Second, the game has been played by millions of gamers at home and
in arcades since 1994, and this is the first major complaint TWI has
heard; if Primal Rage is so offensive, why hasn't anyone protested before?
Third, the game was rated by the Entertainment Software Ratings Board
(ESRB) as being appropriate for teens [age 13 and up], a fact prominently
displayed on the packaging (along with
a graphic description of the game's violent action). By the ESRB's
standard, her son was to young to be playing the game."

   Let me also remind y'all that SNES PR specifically censored Chaos'
Golden Shower fatality, though as far as I know Rovella got _all_ types of
PR pulled from the store shelves. :-( I think Derek Dinges' letter to the
editor of the Mesa, Arizona _Tribune_ puts it best: "If I want to purchase
such a game, it should be up to me. I am an adult, and I should not be
inconvenienced just because one woman feels the subject matter of the game
is inappropriate... If Ms. Rovella wants to discourage her son from buying
certain games... then she needs to take that up with her son. Otherwise
leave me and my constitutional rights alone."
   I encourage y'all to rally your pens to Primal Rage's defense. Write
your senator or your retailer, and let them know what you think.

///8.1 PR characters in Dragon magazine!///

Dragon magazine issue #223 has an article about putting Primal Rage
characters in a fantasy role-playing game scenario! It has detailed
Advanced Dungeons & Dragons statistics for Blizzard, Talon, & Vertigo. The
folks at TSR seem to think that Armadon is the God of Good, Blizzard the
God of Survival, and Talon the God of Death. I disagree, for reasons
briefly explained in my transcript of the article - feel free to e-mail me
(vctr113062@aol.com) for a copy!

///8.2 PR action figures///

From the Feb/March '96 issue of "Tomart's Action Figure Digest":
    "Primal Rage, the hit arcade and home video game from Time Warner
Interactive, enters a third dimension with the unveiling of the action
figure line from Playmates at Toy Fair '96. Many of the creatures'
fighting features have been captured in the figures' actions so that kids
can act out the battle for survival with their favorite living, breathing,
prehistoric characters. With more than a million units of the game in
circulation, there will be plenty of recognition for the brand... and it
looks like another good year for dinosaurs even if kids know nothing about
the game."

Well, the generous folks at TWI sent me free samples of the Sauron, Talon,
& Vertigo action figures (thanks so much!!!). They were so cool I had to
complete my collection w/Armadon, Blizzard, Chaos & Diablo when they hit
the shelves. I found 'em for sale at Kay-Bee Toy & Hobby, and a little
cheaper at Toys R Us (about $7 each). The figures were selling out
amazingly fast, especially the reptiles; I had to drive all the way across
town to find Diablo.
    I have the Primal Rage Basic Assortment set of seven figures. Each is
about six inches tall, and intended for ages 4 and up (some accessories
are small and can be a choking hazard for very young children). They are
vividly painted, mostly in their default colors. All of them have jointed
shoulders & hips, and some extra moveable joints. They're composed of
reasonably durable plastic (Chaos/Vertigo are partly rubber). Each critter
is individually numbered, comes with accessories (claw-shaped dino
overshoes or the like, a worshiper, two Rage cards, a rendition of their
background on cardboard), and has a special "Primal Power." The storyline
for these critters has been tweaked just a tiiiiiny bit; for example, the
rapacious Sauron is now a Virtuous Beast (just be sure to keep those
steakburgers comin'!)
   See section 1.2, "Meet the Critters" for action figure stats and
storylines. Here's a quick take on the toys themselves (I tested all their
special features, too! :).

    -Armadon is light tan with a sparse few deep brown stripes; his eyes
are green with round pupils. He has moveable joints at the shoulders,
hips, tail base, and neck. For accessories, he has a Spiked Tail Mace,
Armored Horn, and worshiper. Special features: pull back Armie's left arm
to make his Bed-o'-Nails spikes extend from his back; push forward his
tail to launch his spring-loaded tail spikes. Do watch out; the spikes
really will fly across the room! Armie is a Virtuous Beast (good guy).

    -Blizzard is white-furred with blue skin and a soft tuft of white
hair; his eyes are yellow with round pupils. He has moveable joints at the
shoulders, elbows, hips, tail base, and neck. For accessories, he has Ice
Pulverizers and a worshiper. Special features: rotate the wheel on his
back or pull and release his arms to make him swing his Pulverizing Mega
Punch. Blizzard is the leader of the Virtuous Beasts (good guys).

    -Chaos is pink-furred with grey skin and a soft tuft of pink hair; his
eyes are yellow with round pupils. He has moveable joints at the
shoulders, elbows, waist, and hips. For accessories, he has a Shaman
Staff, Skull Pounder, and worshiper. Special features: hold Chaos' head
underwater and squeeze his body to fill him up; then aim his face and
squeeze again for his Churl attack. He can spit water only a few feet.
Since he's designed to squirt water, his head and midsection are soft
rubber instead of hard plastic. (No, the figure does not have a Golden
Shower feature - get yer mind outta the gutter! :) Chaos is a Destructive
Dino (bad guy).

   -Diablo is deep red with black stripes; his eyes are brown with slitted
pupils. He has moveable joints at the jaw, shoulders, hips, and tail base.
You have to "plug in" his tail, a task that requires strong hands. ^_^ For
accessories, he has Pulverizer Claws, Blistering Lava Rocks, and a
worshiper. Special features: pull his right arm to make his jaws open and
shut. Load the Lava Rock (fireball) into Diablo's mouth, then pull his
right arm to make him launch his Fireball Attack. Diablo is leader of the
Destructive Dinos (bad guys).
    Diablo is the only PR action figure whose special feature wouldn't
work for me. The lava rocks wouldn't fit in the launcher within his mouth,
and the launch mechanism itself didn't seem to be working. I don't know
whether it's a defect in my particular figure, an oversight in the figure
design, or merely my innate clumsiness. Diablo's mouth will still go
chomp-chomp-chomp when I pull his arm.

   -Sauron looks the most like his arcade counterpart. He's deep yellow
with royal purple stripes; his eyes are yellow with slitted pupils. He has
moveable joints at the jaw, shoulders, hips, and tail base. You have to
"plug in" his tail, a task that requires strong hands. ^_^ For
accessories, he has Clip-on Carnage Chewing Jaws, Earthquake Stomping
Claws, and a worshiper. Special features: pull on his right arm to make
his jaws open and shut, in the Bone Bash attack. Sauron is a Virtuous
Beast (good guy).

   -Talon is deep orange with white crest, underbelly, and feet. He has a
pattern of hollow black diamonds outlined with white striping his back,
tail, and legs; the second half of his tail is all black. His eyes are red
with slitted pupils. He has moveable joints at the shoulders, hips, and
tail base. You have to "plug in" his tail, a task that requires strong
hands. ^_^ For accessories, he has Ripper Wrist Claws, Frantic Fury Foot
Claws, and a worshiper. Special features: pull up on his arms until they
lock, then push his one of his legs back to make him whip down his arms in
the Slasher Attack. Talon is a Virtuous Beast (good guy).

   -Vertigo is deep blue with green tinges and aqua stripes/splotches. Her
eyes are purple with slitted pupils. She has moveable joints at the jaw,
shoulders, hips, and tail base. You have to "plug in" her tail, a task
that requires strong hands. ^_^ For accessories, she has the Voodoo Spell
Staff, Scorpion Sting Tail, and a worshiper. Special features: put her
head underwater and squeeze her body to fill her up. Then point her head
and squeeze her again for her Venom Spit. Vertie can squirt water farther
than Chaos can (up to a yard or more)! Since she's designed to squirt
water, her head and midsection are soft rubber instead of hard plastic.
Vertie is a Destructive Dino (bad gal).

A special set of larger PR action figures just hit the shelves! The
critters are selling for around $22 each, and their chief special feature
appears to be chewing up loyal followers. Here's the description from the
Feb '96 issue of "Lee's Action Figure News & Toy Review":
   "The Super Rage assortment will contain both good and bad dino-beasts,
and will be done in a larger 9" format. Figures will include: Primal Rage
Sauron, Diablo, Blizzard, and Talon.
   "Each Super Rage figure will be individually numbered and come on a
blister card, with Exclusive Primal Rage Collector Game Card Starter
Packs, accessories and Mini-Loyal Follower Action Figure (for Mmmm... good
dino dinin')."

///8.3 PR cards & cardgame rules///

There were a few PR cards in an issue of Game Players magazine from at
least a year ago; good luck finding it. They had a picture of each
character's head on the front and a few moves on the back (some of them
incorrect). The pictures are the most fascinating thing about them;
they're not typical game-screen or action-figure shots. Though the
critters are colored like the action figures, they're more detailed; for
example, you can see each individual feather in Talon's crest.

Now, about the PR card game. The PR action figures each come with two Rage
cards, one of the figure's char, one of a randomly selected other char.
The cards each have a picture of the critter with some text describing
him/her on the front. Each PR critter has two cards devoted to him/her,
with slightly different pictures and identical text. Players can collect
these cards and use them to play the Rage! game, by the following rules:

   1) The game can be played by two or more players.
   2) Shuffle and deal all of the cards face down in front of each player.
Begin with the player to the left of the dealer.
   3) Each player takes the top card on their pile, turns it face up and
adds it to a pile in the middle of the players.
   4) If a matched pair of characters appears, the first player to shout
"RAGE!" takes the pile of cards in the middle and places these cards at
the bottom of the pile in front of them.
   5) If two players shout "RAGE!" at the same time, the players must face
off in head to head battle where they play each other. The first player to
shout "RAGE!" dominates and takes both piles of cards.
   6) A player who shouts "RAGE!" when there is no match, places all their
cards face up in the pile in the middle of the players.
   7) The game is over when the other players are out of cards, and the
last player who has collected all the cards dominates the new "Urth."

///8.4 PR soundtrack is out!!!///

You won't find it on store shelves, but you can mail-order a CD soundtrack
of remixed PR music from Rage On Records! "All the Rage" is one of my
favorite music CDS (along with my Killer Instinct, Mortal Kombat, and
Tekken 2 soundtracks ^_^).
   The soundtrack is produced by Jeanne Parson (creator of all music and
sound effects for arcade PR!) and Lisa Jaime. Since many PR background
music themes are fairly short, they've been extended/mixed with additional
melody, percussion, instruments, and occasionally voiceovers or lyrics.
For example, Talon's song has a violin melody above the drumbeat rhythm of
his usual background music. In addition to the background tunes of the
seven chars, there are three brand-new songs, for a total of ten hits.

   The PR soundtrack costs $15 (California residents please add 8 1/4%
sales tax). Shipping may be extra if you live outside the USA. The check
or money order should be made out to "Rage On Records" and sent to

Rage On Records
P.O. Box 56382
Hayward, CA 94545

Don't forget to include your shipping address! You can also telephone your

There are rumors of a forthcoming PR comic book. If it reaches the store
shelves, I know I'm going to grab myself a copy!

>Oh, one more piece of news. There is a Rage comic coming out at the end
of Septermber. Maybe you should let people know about it. It's by an
independent company called something like sirius.  Hope they draw everone
right.
9. PR2 preview! Whee!!!!!

++++++++++++9. PR2 preview! Whee!!!!!+++++++++++++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The June 1996 issue of EGM2 features a quickie preview of PR2! Its
storyline is that the great meteor was actually a cosmic egg, from which a
terrible new force has now hatched. One thousand years after PR, the gods
of Urth have split up the world into different regions; each region
reflects the nature of its god. The gods communicate with their followers
via human Shamans. Now the cosmic egg has hatched, unleashing a new force
that banishes all the gods from the Urth. So the gods pass their power
onto their Chosen humans, who can even morph into the gods' forms. A new
god, the superb hunter, has entered the scene. PR2 will have six buttons
instead of four.
   There's a piece of artwork showing an unnamed male barbarian with
serrated sword (he looks like Killer Instinct 2's Tusk with a square
haircut); he's Sauron's Chosen. 

   Latest word on the net is that PR2 will have ten new characters
(yowza!), and that the release date was pushed back to December because of
stop-motion delays. I'm looking forward to it, but I do hope at least ONE
of the chars is a true reptile (not just the occasional shape-shifter). If
I wanted to play humans, I could take my pick from some 50 other fighting
games... :-(

anytime soon...)
