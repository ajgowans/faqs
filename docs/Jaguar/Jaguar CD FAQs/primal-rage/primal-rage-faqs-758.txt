
THE PRIMAL RAGE CONDENSED MOVELIST rev. 2.1
   (Chaos' FoFury corrected)

Notes: All moves are confirmed for arcade PR version 2.3. All moves &
fatalites do work on SNES Primal Rage, though some are very hard to do
without a quality joystick. Chaos' Golden Shower fatality is censored in
SNES PR. Chaos doesn't do anything during the Golder Shower and a censor
sign appears. 

"Version 2.3 only" moves & fatalities are not in Genesis PR or 32X PR,
since both are conversions of the earlier arcade version 1.7.

All moves & fatalities listed here work for the IBM PC version if you're
using a four-button joystick. If you're using the keyboard or a two-button
joystick, many of the moves are different. See the PR for IBM PC FAQ for
keyboard moves.

All moves & fatalities should work for Jaguar PR, 3DO PR, & PSX PR. Please
let me know if they don't.

There is a separate, completely different movelist for Game Boy/Game Gear
PR.

   All characters can do three types of jumps in Primal Rage. First, to do
a standard jump, just press up or diagonally up like any other fighting
game. Pretty easy, eh? The second type of jump is the long jump. To do a
long jump, tap down, then do a "normal" jump immediately afterward This
jump will be higher and faster than the standard jump, and it will go much
farther. No more characters whose only jump is a drifter... The third type
of jump is the most difficult, and most surprising jump in any game. A
"hop jump" (a.k.a. "tiger jump") is the shortest possible jump and
*extremely* fast! You do a hop jump by pushing the joystick in the
direction you want to jump, then down, then do the standard jump (either
tapping or rolling the joystick will work). Additionally, the hop jump can
now be done straight up, just tap toward (or away), down, and straight up!
 Unlike version 1.7, Primal Rage version 2.3 lets you execute hop jumps
versus the computer, and the computer can use them against you, too!
Here's a chart to summarize the three different jumps:

Jump Type    | Toward | Away         | Up
________________________________
normal jump  |  UT         | UA          | U
long jump      |  D, UT    | D, UA      | D, U
hop jump       | T, D, UT | A, D, UA | T or A, D, U
