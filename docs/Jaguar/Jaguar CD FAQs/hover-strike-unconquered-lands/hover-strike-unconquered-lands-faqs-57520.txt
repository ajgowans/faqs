I.     Introduction

This is a FAQ/Walkthrough for the Jaguar CD game Hover Strike: Unconquered
Lands.  It contains a list of controls, information on all game missions, and
a mini-review.  It also contains information on how the cartridge version
differs from the CD version.

*******************************************************************************
II.    Background Story

Here is the background story from the instruction booklet:

You fear the worst for the planet's missing colonists.  Communications have
ceased from the distant colony for over six months.  Federation scouts have
discovered that Terrakian Pirates have taken over the planet, their deadly
machines patrolling every section of the surface.

The planet's colonists have completely disappeared.  The Terrakians have
established a horrible factory in the fourth quadrant, where they process
human corpses to extract valuable organic compounds.  You must lead the rescue
mission to save the remaining humans, if any, and regain the planet.

There is no contact with the surface.  The Terrakians have installed an
atmospheric cannon which makes invasion plans and the armada's entry
impossible.

The Federation has chosen you to launch the preemptive strike.  They've
provided you with the preliminary reconnaissance reports.  A military transport
will slip through the enemy's shields and take you to your drop zone.  Your
vehicle is a state-of-the-art armored hovercraft.  It's the ultimate war
machine, equipped with rapid-fire cannon and powerful missiles.  You have full
maneuverability over any planetary terrain, including snow drifts, lava floes,
desert sands, and turbulent water.  Anti-grav units let you float just above
the ground, so you need to use your brakes to slow down.

Your mission is to knock out key targets in each zone, crippling the Terrakian
forces and halting their bloody work.  Let you sensors guide you to destroy
enemy radar stations and blow up strategic fuel depots.  Once you eliminate
the atmospheric cannon you'll make way for the Federation armada.

Save the colony before it's too late!

*******************************************************************************
III.   Getting Started

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  New/Load Game

Once the game loads, if you already have a saved game, you'll have the option
of loading a saved game or starting a new game.  If you are starting a new
game, you will be asked to choose a difficulty level.

Option                 Change Secondary Weapon

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Missions

There are six levels in all, the first five levels have eight missions each and
the final level consists of a single mission.  Each of the first five levels 
also has a hidden bonus mission that can be unlocked on the Mission Select 
screen by entering a code.  You can play the missions for each level in any
order you wish, once you complete the level's final mission, you'll move on to
the next level.

EVERY single mission is the exact same: Find and Destroy X number of targets!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Basic Strategies

-  TURN OFF THE HOVERCRAFT PHYSICS IN THE OPTIONS MENU!  This is the biggest 
   advantage the CD version has over the cartridge and makes the game a LOT 
   better!

-  USE YOUR RADAR!  Your next target will appear as a diamond on the radar.
   In most cases you can simply drive straight to a target, destroy it, then
   move on to the next.

-  Conserve ammo.  Try building up a supply ammo in the early levels so you
   won't have to rely on your cannon in the more difficult missions later on.

-  Save your game after each mission.

-  Play the Bonus Missions.  Bonus Missions 1, 3, and 4 are very easy and
   contain TONS of powerups.

-  Use the Abort Mission command wisely.  You only get TWO lives and ZERO
   continues.  If your shields are critically low, pause the game and choose
   Abort Mission.  You'll be taken back to the Mission Select screen without
   penalty and will have the same number of weapons, lives, and score that you
   had when you started the mission!

-  Whenever possible, avoid enemies to conserve your shields, weapons, and 
   energy.

*******************************************************************************
V.     Weapons

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Photon Cannon

Your main weapon.  Aim it with the crosshair and press B to fire.  Each shot
uses a trace amount of Energy.  Photons also emit a small amount of light and
can be used to see in dark areas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Missiles

Missiles do about five times more damage than your Photon Cannon, but ammo is
limited.  You aim missiles with the crosshair just like your cannon and press
1 or 3 to fire.  Extra missiles can be found during missions, you can carry a
total of 64.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Guided Missiles

Guided Missiles do the same amount of damage as regular Missiles, but instead
of aiming you use your targeting computer to lock-on to a target.  You can
carry a max of 64 Guided Missiles at a time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Mortars

Mortars are your most powerful weapon.  They will only do damage to ground
targets.  Mortars are lobbed at an angle, the higher the crosshair, the further
they'll travel, the lower the crosshair, the shorter they'll go.  You can carry
a maximum of 64 Mortars.

I find that the easiest way to hit targets with Mortars is to keep the
crosshair in the center of the screen and use the radar.  Line up the target
so that it is exactly where the vertical line and center circle on your radar
intersect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Flares

Flares will be available only during night missions.  They are fired just like
Mortars, but instead of doing damage, they will light the area around them.
You have an unlimited supply of Flares and using them does not appear to
consume Energy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  Shields

This is your life meter, every time you take damage, your shields will decrease
and when they are gone, your hovercraft will be destroyed.  You can replenish
your Shields during a mission by collecting Shield powerups.  Your remaining
Shield level is displayed in the lower left of the screen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.  Energy

Energy is your fuel supply, you lose Energy while driving or firing your
cannon.  Once your Energy supply has been completely depleted, your hovercraft
will be destroyed.  You can replenish your Energy during a mission by
collecting Energy powerups.

*******************************************************************************
VI.   Walkthrough

Note:  You can choose to complete the missions in each level in any order.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Level 1

...............................................................................
1.  Vulcan Shootout

Terrain:         Volcanic
Mission Target:  2 Power Turbines

Description:

Two power turbines which provide energy for enemy outposts throughout the
region have been located in this sector.  Knock out both turbines, and defend
yourself against the Terrakian Floaters.

Tips:

This mission is very easy, making it a good choice for your first foray.  At
the start of the mission, you'll be dropped right next to the first Power
Turbine.  Use your cannon to take out the surrounding enemies first, then the
turbine.

Now head towards the next Turbine.  Use your radar to find it, it's represented
by the large diamond.  Be sure to pick up the four powerups on the way, they
will be represented by orange dots on the radar.  Destroy any enemies you
encounter along the way.  Destroy the second turbine to complete your mission.

...............................................................................
2.  Amphibious Strike

Terrain:         Water
Mission Target:  2 Radar Dishes

Description:

Locate and destroy two radar dishes which are located on two small islands.
You'll be encountering rough seas near these islands, so navigation and
targeting will be difficult.

Tips:

The choppy seas will bounce your hovercraft up and down, this will throw off
your targeting.  Your biggest threat will be the many magnetic mines floating
around, shoot them with your cannon before they collide with your vehicle.

Make your way to the first Radar Dish.  On the beach will be two fuel and
shield powerups, ignore them for now.  When you reach the Radar Dish, use your
cannon to take out the gun turret, then the dish itself.  Now collect the two
powerups and head towards the second Radar Dish.

As you approach the next dish, you'll come across three weapons powerups.
Collect them and continue on.  Quickly take out the Radar Dish to complete your
mission.

...............................................................................
3.  Trapped Under Ice

Terrain:         Ice
Mission Target:  4 Floater Factory Entrances

Description:

A giant underground Floater factory has been discovered in this icy region of
the planet.  Knock out all four entrances to the factory and their ships and
weapons will be trapped underground.

Tips:

You'll be dropped off next to the first entrance.  Shoot the entrance with your
cannon, taking out any Floaters that emerge.  Once the entrance is destroyed,
head left to pick up some missiles.  Make your way to the next entrance,
destroying any enemies you encounter.  Take out the second entrance as before.

Move on to the third entrance, you will need to travel through the gap in the
wall to your north.  Continue towards the third entrance, collect any powerups
and destroy any enemies you come across.  Once you destroy the third entrance,
head straight for the fourth one and take it out to earn your ride home.

...............................................................................
4.  Desert Swarm

Terrain:         Desert
Mission Target:  5 Supply Shuttles

Description:

An enemy supply convoy will be passing through this sector to bring weapons to
their desert outpost.  Knock out all five vehicles in their convoy to complete
the mission.  Watch out for floating mines!  Blow them up before they can ram
you.

Tips:

Head southeast towards the convoy.  As you are traveling, you'll notice a
swarm of blue dots following your vehicle; these are the floating mines.  The
best way to deal with them is to quickly do a 180 and nail them with your
cannon.  Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for powerups.

Once you reach the convey, start shooting the shuttles with your cannon.  As
soon as you begin firing, they'll try to out run you.  Pursue them and keep
firing.  The shuttles can float higher than your hovercraft so at times
they'll float over barriers while you have to take the long way around.  After
you've taken care of all five shuttles, your dropship will return to take you
home.

...............................................................................
5.  Industrial Assault

Terrain:         Urban
Mission Target:  4 Missiles

Description:

Four enemy missile sites have been found in an industrial sector, and they must
be destroyed.  Little is known about Terrakian technology, but scouts have
reported back with tales of bizarre landscapes, which are extremely difficult
to navigate.

Tips:

VERY easy.  Your hovercraft is capable of climbing over the structures, so
you can head straight for the first target, collect any powerups you see along
the way.  When you reach the silo, use your cannon to destroy the gun turret,
then the silo.  The second silo is hidden inside a structure and the last two
are located near one another.

...............................................................................
6.  The Unnatural Night

Terrain:         Unknown (Night)
Mission Target:  4 Light Siphons

Description:

Destroy four solar energy light siphons located in this region.  Your mission
will occur at night, and the darkness will make things more difficult.  You
will have an unlimited stock of flares to help light your way.

Tips:

As soon as you land, press the Option button THREE times to switch your
secondary weapon to flares, then spray the area to light it up.  Be sure to
keep doing this the entire mission so you'll be able to see what's going on.
Use your lock-on often, you'll be able to see the cursor even if there's no
light.

You'll begin next to the first light siphon, destroy it and any nearby enemies
with your cannon.  Make your way to the next target, constantly firing flares
as you go.  After taking out the three remaining siphons, you can go home.

...............................................................................
7.  Stealth Attack

Terrain:         Enemy Base
Mission Target:  4 Radar Installations

Description:

A giant military base has been located in the alpha sector of the planet.
Knock out the base's communications by destroying the four radar installations.

Tips:

Another relatively easy mission.  Your hovercraft is capable of scaling the
structures so head straight for your targets.  If you are near a target, but
are having trouble seeing it, try using your lock-on.

...............................................................................
8.  Bloodcount

Terrain:         Organic
Mission Target:  5 Fuel Pumps

Description:

Reconnaissance missions have discovered a vast area of organic material being
used as a type of breeding ground.  Destroy the mysterious derricks to slow
the enemy's operations.

Tips:

Easy as pie.  Use your radar to locate the targets, killing enemies and
collecting powerups along the way.  The first pump is by itself, the second
and third will be close together, and the fourth and fifth will also be
grouped together.

...............................................................................
9.  The Drive for Five! (Bonus Mission)

Terrain:         Bizarre
Mission Target:  1 Floater Factory, COLLECT POWERUPS!

Description:

Congratulations!  You have found the first secret mission.  Your target is
within striking distance, but first you should stock up on ammunition.

Tips:

You'll need to unlock this mission by holding Up, 2, 3, and 6 while on the
Mission Select screen.  If you entered the code correctly, you'll hear a
confirmation sound.  

This mission is an absolute cakewalk!  Ignore the factory entrance and scour
the area for powerups.  Once you've collected all of the powerups, head back
to the factory and destroy it with your cannon to complete the easiest mission
in the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Level 2

...............................................................................
1.  By Demons, Be Conquered

Terrain:         Volcanic
Mission Target:  12 Heavy Armored Tanks

Description:

A division of Terrakian tanks is located in this sector.  Destroy twelve of
these tanks to complete the mission.  Use the numerous volcanic formations for
cover.

Tips:

Depending on which strategy you use to take out the enemy tanks, this mission
can either be extremely difficult or a turkey shoot!  The tanks are too tough
and numerous to go toe-to-toe with, so you'll want to take them out from a
distance.  Mortars are the perfect weapon for doing this, not only can you
attack from beyond enemy weapon range, it only takes a single mortar to
destroy a tank!  

To target an enemy, carefully line it up on radar so that the dot is positioned
where the VERTICAL line and the MIDDLE circle intersect (no weapon lock is 
required), then fire a single shot to take out the tank.

...............................................................................
2.  Snow Blind

Terrain:         Ice
Mission Target:  4 Command Centers

Description:

Four command and control buildings are located in a hilly, snow covered are of
the planet.  From your drop point proceed carefully to your four targets.  This
area is heavily defended by assorted Terrakian ships.

Tips:

They weren't kidding about this are being heavily defended!  As soon as you
land you'll be under attack.  Instead of standing your ground and fighting,
the best course of action is to hit the accelerator and head towards the first
target.  By this point, you've probably maxed out your missiles at 64, so you
might as well use them, it takes two to destroy a Command Center.

...............................................................................
3.  Crossing Ridges

Terrain:         Desert
Mission Target:  4 Fuel Tanks

Description:

An enemy fuel depot has been located at the intersection of two ridge lines.
The fuel tanks have been strategically located on opposite sides of the ridges.
Destroy all four fuel tanks to successfully complete the mission.

Tips:

The ridges are shaped like a giant 'X' with one fuel tank in each of the
angles.  Once again there are two ways to complete this mission.  The first is
to simply follow along the ridges in a single direction, taking out the fuel
tanks when you see them.  Not only does this take too long, but there are too
many enemies for you to survive the trip.

The second (and easier) solution is to follow a ridge to where it ends, then
ride UP ONTO the ridge and head towards the center of the 'X'.  From up there
you can take out the fuel tanks using a single missile with exposing yourself
to enemy fire.

...............................................................................
4.  The Sands of Time

Terrain:         Water
Mission Target:  13 Sensor Pods

Description:

Thirteen sensor pods must be cleared out of this area.  Using these devices,
enemy intelligence will be able to track our force's every move.  Most of the
pods are in the ocean and may be difficult to find.

Tips:

Your radar will be crucial here.  Use it to locate the Sensor Pods, the number
in the lower right of your radar is the number of pods remaining.  Nearly all
of the pods will be located on rocks, if you are having trouble seeing them,
use your lock-on to help.

Fuel will be a big issue for this mission.  Try to take out all of the pods in
an area before moving on.  Also be sure to make your shots count and to pick up
any fuel powerups you see.

...............................................................................
5.  Armies in the Darkness

Terrain:         Unknown (Night)
Mission Target:  16 Parked Aircraft

Description:

A squadron of Terrakian stealth fighters have been located in this sector.
Destroy them before they dust off.  Attack at night, and use your photons and
flares to light the way.

Tips:

Not too difficult.  Constantly pepper the sky with flares to light up your
surroundings.  Use your radar to find the planes and then destroy them with
your cannon.

...............................................................................
6.  River of Souls

Terrain:         Urban
Mission Target:  8 Processing Stations

Description:

There are eight organic processing stations up and running in this sector.
These stations are vital to the Terrakian bio-manufacturing system.  Destroy
all eight to stop the slaughter of the colonists.

Tips:

The target closest to the drop zone is also the hardest to reach.  You COULD
follow the wall left and take a long, winding path to reach it.  Or you could
skip the side trip and just use mortars.  The rest of the targets are much more
accessible.  Use your radar to locate them and then use your cannons
to take them down.

...............................................................................
7.  Underground Ambush

Terrain:         Enemy Base
Mission Target:  12 Underground Blasters

Description:

This area of the base is guarded by a set of elevator turrets.  Knock out all
twelve of these weapons to complete the mission.  Destroy them before they lock
onto your position.

Tips:

The targets are located in groups of three.  Take them out with your cannon,
be careful, they shoot back!  If your shield gets too low, take them out from
a distance using mortars.

...............................................................................
8.  Tremors

Terrain:         Organic
Mission Target:  12 Underground Drillers

Description:

Eliminate the squadron of underground farming robots.  Look for motions on the
surface to detect their location.

Tips:

The Underground Drillers are a real pain!  They will tunnel under the ground
Bugs Bunny style then pop up and attack.  You can't attack them until they are
above ground, take them out with your cannon when they appear.  The targets are
divided into four groups.  Keep your eyes peeled for powerups while you are
traveling to the third and fourth groups.

...............................................................................
9.  Barbecue (Bonus Mission)

Terrain:         Hell
Mission Target:  14 Cloaked Fighters

Description:

Reports have come in that the Terrakian terrorist Baba Booey is stealing
rations from our established military command post.  Save the barbecue before
the troops go hungry!

Tips:

The game's second bonus mission is a LOT more difficult than the first!  The
Cloaked Fighters will appear as blinking dots on your radar.  When they cloak,
not only will you no longer be able to see them, but you will also lose your
weapons lock.

Use your cannon to take out the fighters.  There will also be a lot of floating
mines around for you to deal with.  Before destroying the final two targets,
be sure to collect the nearby powerups.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Level 3

...............................................................................
1.  Hammered

Terrain:         Desert
Mission Target:  10 Trap-Door Gun Emplacements

Description:

We've discovered that a small valley that we plan to use as a landing zone for
some of our forces is defended by underground trap door turrets.  Clear out all
ten of these turrets to secure the landing zone for our landing troops.

Tips:

You'll come under HEAVY fire as soon as you land.  Quickly head into the small
alcove to your south to take cover.  From here, use either mortars or guided
missiles to take out the turrets.

...............................................................................
2.  Depths of Madness

Terrain:         Water
Mission Target:  10 Radar Dishes

Description:

The Terrakian warlords rely on ten radar dishes in this sector to relay
information to their tank divisions.  Shut down this communication by
destroying the dishes.

Tips:

Tough.  Starting with the fourth target, in order to reach the Radar Dishes, 
you'll have to navigate mazes while being barraged by fire from multiple gun
turrets.  Instead, I recommend avoiding the mazes and using mortars on the 
dishes.  When traveling between targets, keep moving to avoid turret fire and
be on the lookout for Floating Mines.

...............................................................................
3.  Frozen Outpost

Terrain:         Ice
Mission Target:  12 Walkers

Description:

A division of Terrakian walkers guard this sector of the planet.  The walker is
one of the Terrakians most feared weapons so exercise caution when engaging
them.

Tips:

Not too difficult, as long as you keep moving.  There are plenty of shield
powerups lying around, be sure to grab them when your shields are low.  To
take out a walker, hit it with two missiles, then a single shot of your cannon
to finish it off.

...............................................................................
4.  Corridors of Dread

Terrain:         Urban
Mission Target:  8 Fuel Tanks

Description:

Locate and destroy eight fuel tanks in this sector.  Without this fuel, all
Terrakian ships in this area will be easy targets when our attack begins.

Tips:

Definitely one of the easiest mission is level three.  Head straight for your
targets, taking out enemies and picking up powerups along the way.

...............................................................................
5.  Damaged and Disconnected

Terrain:         Volcanic
Mission Target:  4 Communication Satellite Dishes

Description:

To prevent the Terrakians from receiving a warning of our pending attack, you
must knock out the four Communication Dishes located in this sector.

Tips:

This one is also relatively easy, just keep moving and be sure to collect any
powerups you see.  It takes two missiles to destroy a dish.

...............................................................................
6.  Burn Away the Night

Terrain:         Unknown (Night)
Mission Target:  9 Chemical Labs

Description:

Terrakian scientists use heavily fortified laboratories in this sector to
experiment with dangerous biochemical weapons.  Destroy all nine buildings to
complete the mission.

Tips:

The first part is the hardest, you have to make your way through ridges while
being attacked by missile turrets.  Take it slow and destroy the turrets as
you encounter them.  Once you are past the ridges you can head straight for the
targets.  The Chemical Labs are located in groups of three, use your cannon to
destroy them.  Be sure to collect the powerups near the first and third groups.

...............................................................................
7.  Crossfire

Terrain:         Enemy Base
Mission Target:  12 Fixed Gun Emplacements

Description:

Our forces will attack this base by entering through a network of canals.
Destroy the twelve enemy gun emplacements that guard these canals to complete
the mission.

Tips:

If you have a good supply of missiles, this is a very easy mission.  You'll be
dropped off near a cache of powerups.  Take the guns out from a distance using
missiles, it only takes one to destroy them.

...............................................................................
8.  Pangaea

Terrain:         Organic
Mission Target:  4 Fuel Pumps

Description:

More strategic derricks have been found in the organic area.  The derricks are
extracting bio-matter to harness their energy and create bionic weaponry.
Destroy all of these crucial targets.

Tips:

You'll come under fire as soon as you land.  Instead of trying to outrun
enemies, take them out as quickly as possible.  The first and second pumps are
by themselves and the third and fourth pumps are together.  Destroy the Fuel
Pumps using your cannon.

...............................................................................
9.  Leonard, Is That You? (Bonus Mission)

Terrain:         Extreme
Mission Target:  4 Sensor Pods, COLLECT POWERUPS

Description:

Collect as many powerups as you can.  There are no shield or energy powerups,
so clear out the targets carefully.

Tips:

The third bonus mission is another cakewalk.  Just head straight for the
targets, collecting powerups as you go.  Use your cannon to take out the sensor
pods.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Level 4

...............................................................................
1.  Valley of Death's Shadow

Terrain:         Desert
Mission Target:  16 Gun Turrets

Description:

Our invasion troops will be passing through maze-like mountains in this sector,
but deadly enemy gun turrets guard the area.  Destroy all sixteen gun turrets
to complete the mission.  Remember, the entire turret must be destroyed to 
register a kill.

Tips:

The easiest way to accomplish your goal is to use guided missiles, it takes
only one to destroy a turret.  There are plenty of powerups lying around, but
be wary of lurking trap door turrets.

...............................................................................
2.  Fiercer Than All

Terrain:         Ice
Mission Target:  8 Light-Siphons

Description:

Destroy the eight Light Siphons which are located in this sector.  Your landing
zone will be patrolled by a Terrakian armored division so be prepared when you
land.

Tips:

There will be several tanks in the landing zone, quickly destroy them using
missiles (five each).  If you manage to survive the beginning, the rest of the
mission is actually pretty easy, just use your radar to find the targets and
destroy them with your cannon.

...............................................................................
3.  The Dawn Patrol

Terrain:         Unknown (Night)
Mission Target:  10 Cloaked Fighters

Description:

The Terrakians have an attack craft that can cloak itself, becoming completely
invisible to our radar.  However, they must uncloak to attack.  Eliminate ten
cloaking floaters, stationed in this sector.

Tips:

Definitely the most frustrating mission in the entire game!  Not only does the
mission take place at night, but most of the time the targets are invisible to
your radar!  

The Cloaked Floaters will appear as blinking dots on your radar (while they are
visible).  Once they cloak, the target diamond will disappear and you'll lose
your weapon lock-on.  It could just be me, but it seems that the targets spend
more time cloaked when you have flares in the air, so try not shooting flares
and sitting in the dark to draw them out.

It took me several tries to complete this mission, so try to be patient.  The
best advice I can give is to go it slow and take out all enemies as you 
encounter them.  

...............................................................................
4.  Metal Inferno

Terrain:         Volcanic
Mission Target:  5 Nuclear Reactors

Description:

Five nuclear generators are operating in this volcanic sector of the planet.
They are supplying power to Terrakian defensive forces.  You must clear the way
for our impending surgical strike.

Tips:

This mission is really long and tedious.  The only challenge is finding the
small (and well camouflaged) passages through the walls to reach the targets.
There are some Floater Factory entrances, but if you destroy them quickly with
your missiles, they shouldn't pose too much of a threat.

...............................................................................
5.  Canal Apocalypse

Terrain:         Urban
Mission Target:  6 Power Turbines

Description:

Slip into the Terrakian city and knock out the six Power Turbines which provide
energy for the city's defense system.  One turbine is hidden and may be hard to
locate.

Tips:

You'll be attacked as soon as you land.  Floor the accelerator and head towards
the first target.  Along the way, you'll see two other turbines on your radar,
go ahead and destroy them now using your cannon.  The final target is the
hidden one.  Instead of hunting for the hidden path, just take it out using
mortars.

...............................................................................
6.  Alien Shores

Terrain:         Water
Mission Target:  5 Missiles

Description:

A set of five missiles armed with warheads which contain deadly chemicals are
ready to be launched against our landing forces.  Knock out the missiles before
they can be used.

Tips:

Very simple.  As soon as you land, do a 180 and move to the target on the beach
and destroy it with your cannon.  Use your radar to locate the other targets,
as long as you keep moving, the enemies here shouldn't pose much of a threat.

...............................................................................
7.  Scabies

Terrain:         Organic
Mission Target:  30 Floaters

Description:

Huge numbers of the floating drones are protecting the next huge bio-matter
harvest.  Sabotage their efforts and eliminate the drones.

Tips:

This is a very long but very easy mission.  Use your radar to find the targets
they are usually in groups of two or three.  You can take them out using either
your cannon or guided missiles.  Avoid any other enemies and be sure to pick
up any powerups you encounter.

...............................................................................
8.  Armored Engagement

Terrain:         Enemy Base
Mission Target:  4 Sensor Pods

Description:

Knock out the base's early warning system by destroying the four sensor pods
which are scattered throughout the base.

Tips:

Another simple mission, just keep moving and use your radar to find the
targets.  If you are having trouble seeing a Sensor Pod, use your lock-on.
One important thing to note is that as far as I can tell there are ZERO
powerups in this mission!

...............................................................................
9.  Cape Ken-averal (Bonus Mission)

Terrain:         Wet
Mission Target:  16 Parked Jets, COLLECT POWERUPS

Description:

Planes circle the ocean protecting many powerups.  Destroy the sixteen parked
jets to finish the mission.

Tips:

The jets are located in four groups of four.  There are plenty of powerups, so
be sure to max out all three weapons.  Feel free to use guided missiles on the
flying jets, you'll be able to replenish your supply before you end the
mission.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Level 5

...............................................................................
1.  Arctic Attack

Terrain:         Ice
Mission Target:  4 Communication Satellite Dishes

Description:

These four dishes provide the Terrakian Space Cannons with targeting
information.  Destroy the four dishes in this icy region to complete the
mission.

Tips:

WARNING, ONLY CHOOSE THIS MISSION IF YOU HAVE A DECENT SUPPLY OF MORTARS!  One
of the targets is behind a boundary wall and CANNOT be reached, so it must be
destroyed from afar with mortars.

Once again you'll come under attack as soon as you land, so immediately hit
the accelerator and head towards the first target.  You'll spot two other 
targets on the way, go ahead and destroy them now.  Like I mentioned in the
previous paragraph, the final target is behind a boundary wall and cannot be
reached so you MUST use mortars.  If you run out of mortars, your only option
is to abort the mission and start over.

...............................................................................
2.  Night of Ascension

Terrain:         Night (Unknown)
Mission Target:  9 Floater Factory Entrances

Description:

Another giant underground factory has been discovered in this sector.  Attack
the factory at night to take advantage of the darkness.  Destroy all nine
factory entrances.

Tips:

You'll be attacked by two Patrol Floaters when you land, quickly take them out
with your cannon.  The entrances are located in groups of three, quickly take
them out using your missiles (it takes four each) before you are overwhelmed
by Floaters.  Destroy the Floaters using your cannon.  You'll also need to be
on the lookout for Cloaked Floaters and Floating Mines.  Be sure to pick up the
powerups that are on the way to the second and third groups.

...............................................................................
3.  Desert Canyons

Terrain:         Desert
Mission Target:  4 Chemical Labs

Description:

Terrakian laboratories are located at the southern ends of a series of parallel
canyons.  These canyons are connected at the northern end by an intersecting
canyon.  Negotiate your way through these canyons and blow up all four labs to
successfully complete the mission.

Here's a crude ASCII map of the stage:

 - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 |      |      |      | 
 |      |      |      |
[ ]    [ ]    [ ]    [ ]
 |      |      |      | 
 |      |      |      |
[ ]    [ ]    [ ]    [ ]
 |      |      |      | 
 |      |      |      |
[ ]    [ ]    [ ]    [ ]
 |      |      |      | 
 |      |      |      |
[X]    [X]    [X]    [X]

The lines represent narrow passages, the [ ] open areas, and the X the targets.
You begin the mission in the far lower left right next to one of the Chemical
Labs.  As soon as you land, you'll come under heavy fire from two tanks, take
them out as quickly as possible using missiles.  Destroy the Chemical Lab with
your cannon.

When traveling to your next target, switch from radar to compass mode.  You'll
head north to the very top of the map then head east, then south when you come
to the next passage.  You need to be very careful in this mission, there are
TONS of tanks and turrets, it is imperative that you take them out while
sustaining as little damage as possible.  There are some powerups, but they
are heavily guarded.

...............................................................................
4.  Secret Gauntlet

Terrain:         Urban
Mission Target:  10 Processing Stations

Description:

More of the Terrakian processing plants have been located in this sector.  You
may need to search through the mountains to get to some of the plants.

Tips:

Pretty straightforward.  Head straight for the targets using your radar.  There
are a lot of enemies around, so try to keep moving to avoid taking damage.  
There are some powerups lying around so be sure to collect them when you can.
The last target is the "hidden" one, instead of hunting for the secret passage,
just take it out using mortars.

...............................................................................
5.  Los Tiberones

Terrain:         Volcanic
Mission Target:  5 Power Turbines

Description:

Destroy the five power turbines which are located in this area.  You may need
to negotiate your way through some lava canyons to reach your targets.

Tips:

Not too hard, just use your radar to locate the targets.  There are plenty of
Floaters flying around carrying powerups if you need them.

...............................................................................
6.  Harvest the Sorrow

Terrain:         Water
Mission Target:  13 Sensor Pods

Description:

An amphibious assault will take place by our forces in this sector.  Knock out
the area's surveillance systems by destroying all thirteen sensor pods.

Tips:

This mission is very tedious.  The targets are located on four different
islands.  On each island there is a road on the westside leading up to the
targets.

...............................................................................
7.  Black Out

Terrain:         Enemy Base
Mission Target:  8 Power Plants

Description:

Cripple the defense systems of the enemy base by blowing up the eight power
stations.  Expect to be confronted by an assortment of enemy craft along the
way.

Tips:

Very straightforward.  Just use your radar to locate the targets, keep moving,
and collect any powerups you see.

...............................................................................
8.  Epistrophy

Terrain:         Organic
Mission Target:  25 Floaters

Description:

Your efforts to prevent the bio-farming have failed.  The enemy have created a
deadly squadron of self-powered bionic drones.  Be careful, and keep moving to
stay alive.

Tips:

Almost identical to the organic mission in level 4.  The targets this time are
the UFOs, try to avoid contact with other enemies.  You can use either your
cannon or guided missiles to take down your targets.

...............................................................................
9.  A Vulgar Display of Power (Bonus Mission)

Terrain:         California
Mission Target:  2 Competitive Game Manufacturers

Description:

You finally made it.  Thumbs tired?  Don't stop now, as you will witness the
enormity of Fuji-City 64 ...

The Hover Strike Development Team Thanks You!!!  Good Luck!!!

Tips:

UGH!  This mission is really long and really boring.  You have to navigate
past a huge maze of barriers to reach the targets.  Not only is it easy to get
lost, there are a ton of enemies and few powerups.  My advice, avoid the stage
entirely! 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  Level 6

...............................................................................
1.  The Final Strike

Terrain:         Ice
Mission Target:  3 Atmospheric Laser Cannons

Description:

Now for your final, and the most difficult targets.  The three Terrakian
Atmospheric Cannons that protect the planet.  Remember, our forces will be
annihilated before they land if your mission is not successful!

Tips:

The final mission is long and difficult.  You have to take the scenic route
to reach the targets so you will be navigating using your compass instead of
radar.

When the mission begins, immediately head northwest, then take the path east.
Eventually you will reach a river, follow it.  Shortly after your heading
changes to northwest, you'll arrive at an intersection.  Take the path to the
northeast.  Continue following the river, eventually you'll be heading towards
the southwest.  When you arrive at the next intersection, continue heading
southwest.  If you are on the right path, you'll soon be heading EXACTLY
northwest.  When the river ends, continue going northwest and you'll reach the
Laser Cannons in moments.

The targets are HUGE and take a TON of ammo to destroy (10 missiles each)!  As
soon as you destroy the third one, your mission is complete and you've won the
game!

The ending varies slightly depending on the difficulty level.  On Easy and
Normal you will get a message telling you that you need to beat the game on
a higher difficulty to truly prove your worth.  If you beat the game on Hard,
you get a special congratulations message and will be shown the codes to unlock
the bonus missions.

VIII.    Hover Strike and HS: Unconquered Lands Comparison

Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands was released a few months after the original
Hover Strike.  HS: Unconquered Lands is actually NOT a sequel, it's more like
a do-over.  Here is a list of what's new and/or different in the CD version:

-  The biggest change is that the controls have been fixed!  You now have the
   option of turning off the hovercraft physics (inertia, recoil, etc.).  A
   reverse button has also been added.

-  You have the option of turning off damage from falls and collisions with
   terrain.

-  Ten new missions have been added.

-  Full Motion Video clips have been added.

-  The cd version has a two save slots, the cartridge only one.

-  The background story at the beginning now scrolls "Star Wars" style.

-  The graphics have been updated.  Texture maps have been added and the frame
   rate is a bit higher than in the cartridge version.

-  The music is much higher quality.

-  The lighting effects in night missions have been improved and flares are
   much more effective.

-  The music track cheat no longer works, but now there is a cheat that enables
   vector graphics.

-  The reverse button has been added to the overlay.

*******************************************************************************
IX.     Game Review

Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands was released for the Jaguar CD just months
after the cartridge version.  Not a sequel, it's more of a do-over that fixes
nearly all of the problems that plagued the original.

The most important difference is that they fixed the controls!  You now have 
the option of turning off the hovercraft inertia and damage recoil.  You can 
also now move in reverse at the press of a button.

The graphics have also been improved.  Texture maps have been added and the
frame rate is a smidge better.  The music is now CD quality and is among the
best of any game for the Jaguar.

The other two selling points are the new full motion videos and ten additional
missions.  While they seem nice on paper, they don't really add anything to
the game.

Hover Strike: Unconquered Lands is a marked improvement over the original and
one of the better CD games available for the Jaguar.  Even if you hated the
original Hover Strike, I definitely recommend giving HS: Unconquered Lands a
try.


Pros

+  HUGE improvement over the cartridge version, the graphics, music, and
   controls are MUCH better.
+  Awesome soundtrack.
+  Two player co-op.

Cons

-  The ten new missions are exactly the same as the other ones.
