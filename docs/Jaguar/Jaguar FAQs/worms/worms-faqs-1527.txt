KULP's Guide to Worms for the Saturn
Version 1.0 - June 1997
By KULP

	Hi! I have created a FAQ on Worms because I really like the 
game and I need something easy for my first attempt. Not much to it but
I hope you like it anyways.

	Worms is pretty much a senseless games. 4 worms per team, up to
4 teams fighting at one stage. The object of the game is to basically
blow the crap out of the other teams with homing missles, grenades,
uzis, and the mother of them all, sheep. Good luck.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Controls

	If you ask me, the controls are quite simple to use. To use
your weapon, press button C. To pick a different, press button B. If
you are not happy with the first set of weapons, that's tough! Joking.
Press button B again to access the second set of weapons. To go back to
the first set of weapons, press button B again. Press button A to jump.
The start button pauses the game. Press button B to access quit
options.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Weaponry

	Bazooka and homing missles are sort of alike. One of the few
differences is, well, obviously, the homing missles seek and destroy a
specific target. Both are effected by wind. To control how hard you
fire, press, and hold button C, until you think you have enough power. 
I don't reccomend you use the bazooka unless you have a nearby target.

	Grenades, cluster bombs, and secret banana bombs are all used
the same way. When equipped, you can change the time until it detonates
from 1 to 5 seconds by using the left shift button. Right shift button
will change bounce to minimum or maximum. The grenade is very ordinary
while the cluster and banana bombs aren't. When hit the ground (or
wherever) they will explode into 5 different pieces. Each banana bomb
is worth 50 more points of damage than each piece of cluster bomb. 
Unless you have tremendous aim, I recommend you don't use these items.

	The shotgun is the only weapon you can use twice. Many times,
they are good for breaking through a small wall with one shot, and
using the second for an enemy that was on the other side. The uzi and
minigun are almost exactly alike. Each has a normal rapid fire shot,
minigun is possibly more powerful.

	The dragon punch and fireball are right out of Street Fighter.
Don't tell me you've never played Street Fighter.

	Mines are good for protecting yourself in a cavern from 
enemies. But beware, if you get to close you could end up frying. The
dynamite is possibly the best weapon in the game. If you are good with
the ninja rope (description up ahead), get over high places and lay 
your dynamite right on your enemy's head. And then there is sheep. Let
it go, watch it run around for about 30 seconds, and BOOM! It explodes.

	Airstrike and teleport are exactly alike except airstrike is an
attack and teleport, well, it umm... teleports. Just take the cursor
arrow and press button C and you either just dropped 8 bombs on your
opponent or you teleported to safety.

	The blowtorch digs in 4 directions. Diagonal up left, diagonal
up right, diagonal down left, and diagonal down right. The drill will
only dig straight down.

	The ninja rope is very hard to master. Heck, it's even harder
to explain. You people are just gonna' have to find this one out for
yourselves. As for the mystery of the bungee, have it equipped and walk
off the edge. Instead of falling and losing a turn, possibly falling 
into water and dying, you will swing around until you let go. Press 
button C to let go.

	Of course then there is kamakazie. Basically, fly in a straight 
line for half a second, then, blow up.

	Gerders can have many uses. You can use them for bridges and
protection. Press left shift to change which direction the gerder
faces.

	Prod is a simple push that takes off no life

	Skip go skips your turn and surrender makes your team 
surrender. How hard is that?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hints and Tips

1. If you are losing, and only have one or two worms, make them dig for
protection and airstrike the other team for the rest of the battle.

2. If a worm is on a ledge, use the homing missle to try to knock him
off the ledge.

3. Dynamite is very useful and very affective. One good explosion can
take up to 75 hit points.

4. Grenades, cluster bombs, and banana bombs are very hard to use. Use
at your own risk.

5. Although you do die, the kamakazie can be very effective.

6. Never hesitate to attack the enemies.

7. Skip Go is the most useless item. Never skip your turn.

8. Prod can be useful for pushing a worm down a snowbank. But usually 
it is safer to use a fireball. It takes off 30 points of damage, and
knocks the opponent further away.

9. When using airstrike, try to hide under something so the enemy can't
hit you as easilyor at all.

10. When a crate explodes near a worm, and the explosion hits the worm,
it will take off more life. When using a weapon, if there is a crate
near the enemy, aim your weapon in between them.

Cheats

	Actually, there aren't cheats, there is just a cheat. Just go 
to the weapon options, move your cursor away from the word, exit, and 
press buttons C, Z, Z, C, Z, Z, C, Z, Z, and you will have banana 
bombs, the minigun, and sheep instead of cluster bombs, the uzi, and
mines.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Creditz

	I would like to start off by thanking Team 17 for not only
making the game, but for all of the custom stages they put on there
pages. Of course, they only gave 4 themselves. Other kids sent them the
others. I would like to thank all the people who sent their stages in,
and I encourage other readers to do the same.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	In the next version (if there is a next version) will have more
hints, more cool stages, and will be much more funny (like the game).
If you have any questions, all you have to do is E-mail KULP, and I 
will get your message. Until then, keep your worms moist.
