Ultra Vortek fans and players! If you read rec.games.video.atari, you've 
probably seen Vaultkeeper's exhaustive UV FAQ. We've been amazed at how fast the 
UV moves and codes have spread on the Internet, and it seems natural to put a 
FAQ here compiled by players rather than a cheat sheet of our own. Vaultkeeper 
wrote and updates this list, so if you have additions or corrections you should 
mail them to him.

Section One


This is the Jaguar's second fighting attempt and I must say it really 
kicks butt! It consists of seven playable characters ranging from robots to 
humans with extraordinary powers. By combining the graphics of MK with the 
gameplay of SF2 this game is really a winner. Enough talk. There are fatalities 
in this game known as "Annihilations" as well as background "Annihilations" in 
which the background interacts and kills your opponent. One last thing... each 
character has multiple "annihilations."
