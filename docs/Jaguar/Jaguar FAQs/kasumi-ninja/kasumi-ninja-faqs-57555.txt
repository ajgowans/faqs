I.     Introduction

This is a FAQ/Move List for the Atari Jaguar game Kasumi Ninja.  It contains
a list of controls, the special moves for all characters, and a mini-review.

*******************************************************************************
II.    Background Story

Here is the background story from the instruction booklet:

Discover the Mystery ...

For many generations, rumors have persisted of a small, well-hidden island
known as Kasumi, which has produced the world's most renowned ninjas.  With the
help of the Preeminent Celestials, the island is kept shrouded in secrecy.  An
impenetrable wall of mist surrounds the island, making it undetectable to
modern technology.  Those who find the island uninvited, are never heard from
again.

All your life you have trained hard in body and spirit at the only home you
have known: the Dragon Cloud Temple on Kasumi Island.  At the temple you are
trained by the Elders, a group of three wise and powerful Ninjas.  This group
of Elders consists of Hei, who embodies the lighter aspects of human nature;
Kaioh, who embodies the aspect of indifference; and Gyaku, who embodies the
darker side of human nature.  This balance of good and evil is what keeps the
portal to the netherworld closed.

Using the blackest magic, Gyaku eliminated the other two Elders, throwing the
cosmic forces out of alignment.  When this happened, the gate to the demon
world was blown open and Gyaku became possessed by the most powerful demon in
the netherworld.  With this power, Gyaku could destroy the Earth!

Your fate has been preordained by the Celestials to fulfill a great and
terrible prophecy.  You were told this by the Elders when you were very young.
Throughout your life you wondered what it meant.  Now you are sure it is your
destiny to defeat Gyaku, close the gate to the netherworld and restore balance
to the universe.

The Celestials cannot help you directly, but they have blessed you with the
power of absorbing other's abilities.  To gain these abilities, you must defeat
a variety of champions representing the best fighters in the world.  They have
been chosen by the Celestials to aid you in your quest.  Only through
persistence and perseverance, you will have a chance to challenge Gyaku.

*******************************************************************************
III.   Getting Started

Press B on the Title Screen to bring up the Main Menu:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  One Player Story Mode

Choose this to begin the main game.  You will start in a room with two statues,
choose one as the fighter you'll play as.  Then you'll be asked to choose your
opponent.  After defeating an opponent, they'll become playable.  After
defeating all six opponents, if you are playing on Normal or higher difficulty,
you'll face Lord Gyaku.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Two Player V.S. Mode

Begins a two player game.  Player One chooses his or her fighter first, then
Player Two chooses.  You can NOT pick the same character unless you have
entered the Same Player code (see Secrets and Cheats section.)  Player Two
will then get to choose where you fight.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Difficulty

This displays the current difficulty level, it can be changed by pressing B.

There are four different gore levels, the higher the level, the higher the
gore.  Death Moves are only available on the Gore Fest setting and this setting
is only available with the Parental Lock set to OFF.

...............................................................................
Parental Lock

Toggle the Parental Lock on or off.  If it is on, the Gore Fest gore level will
not be available and therefore neither will Death Moves.  You must input your
Gore Code in order to turn this off.

Gore Code

This allows you to enter a new or change an old Parental Lock code.  Your Gore
Code must be 6 digits and is entered using the numpad.  If you forget the code,

IV.    Basic Gameplay

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Controls

Joypad Up          Jump
Joypad Left/Right  Move Fighter
Joypad Left        Block
Joypad Down        Duck
A Button           Press Once To Punch, Repeatedly For Rapid Punches
B Button           Kick
C Button           Hold To Perform Special Moves (see Move Lists for details)
Down + B           Sweep Kick
Up + B             Jump Kick
Back + B           Roundhouse

Numpad 0           Toggles Music On/Off
Numpad * + #       Resets Game


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Combat

Each match is a best of three (vs. Gyaku is best of five).  Each opponent's
life is represented by a sword, the more damage they take, the bloodier it
gets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Death Moves

Once you defeat your opponent for the second time, you'll hear a voice say
"Show No Mercy!" and your opponent will be staggered.  You will have a short
amount of time to enter your character's Death Move (fatality) to dispatch
your opponent in a gruesome manner.  Please note that Death Moves are only
available with the Parental Lock OFF and the Gore Level at Gore Fest!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Basic Strategies

-  I recommend that when you are starting out, begin by playing Two Player mode
   by yourself so you can get used to the controls and practice Special Moves.

-  Learn how to use Habaki/Senzo since they are the only two fighters available
   at the beginning.

-  The standard Jump Kick followed by a Sweep Kick combo works well on all of
   your opponents, even Demon Gyaku!

-  When you are at a distance, constantly throw projectiles.

*******************************************************************************
V.     Fighters

Move Key:   F = Forward, B = Backwards, U = Up, D = Down, P = Punch, K = Kick
            C = C Button (Hold during entire move), + means press together, and
            a comma (,) means press in sequence.

            Some directions will be combined, for example UF means to press
            diagonally between Up and Forward on the joypad.

Note:  Death Moves are only available with the gore option set to Gore Fest.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Habaki

Age:     28          Height:  5' 10"
Weight:  148 lbs.    Style:   Ninjitsu

Description:

Habaki is the eldest son (by ten minutes) of the Kiri-gakure family.  At an
early age the twin brothers were left in the care of the monks at the Dragon
Cloud Temple.  The two brothers were equally adept at the arts, both
spiritually and physically.  The Elders, noticing the great skill of the twins,
offered them a chance to advance their arts by training as disciples under one
of the Elders.  Habaki was chosen by Kaioh and Senzo was chosen by Hiei.  There
have also been rumors of Gyaku taking a disciple, but no one has ever seen his
student.  During tournaments held at the Dragon Cloud Temple, the twins always
cause a special interest because of their fierce competitiveness.  The final
match always comes down to the two brothers and each have won an equal number
of Championships over the years.

mixing different martial arts to develop a style all his own.  Loud and
obnoxious, Chagi has the ability to back up his big mouth with a dazzling

search of battles to join so that they might pillage and kill, their two
greatest joys!  The most ruthless of the Goths was their king, Alaric.  Not
only was he a renowned fighter, he was also a skillful tactician, leading his
tribe to certain victory time and time again.  One of his greatest
accomplishments was his imaginative use of gunpowder in many dangerous and
unique ways.

block it, then follow it up with a Sweep Kick.

Age:     21          Height:  5' 10"
Weight:  130 lbs.    Style:   Feral

Description:

Thundra is the queen of a lost tribe of Amazon warriors.  These warriors have
taken a solemn oath to protect the rainforest from modern industrialists who
wish to destroy it for their own profit.  This is done by surgically sabotaging
vital equipment and assassinating high ranking company officials.  Thundra is
their greatest warrior and as a result, she was appointed queen.  She has
trained her warriors in a fighting art handed down for generations.  This art
was taken directly from the forces of nature and those who have mastered this
art can channel their inner power to imitate the fury of nature.

Move List:

  Throw:  P + B
  Lunging Punch:  P + F
  Teleport:  Hold C then press D, U
  Jungle Strike:  Hold C then press F, F, F

Weight:  210 lbs.    Style:   Wrestling

Description:

Pakawa is the chief of the Comanche fighting tribe, the Tu-Wee-Kah.  For many
years the Comanches lived in harmony with nature.  When the colonists settled
in, the Comanches welcomed them with open hearts.  As time went on, the
colonists grew greedy and started to forcefully take the land from the
Comanches, with no respect for the Comanche life.  Pakawa decided to train a
group of elite warriors and called them the Tu-Wee-Kah.  The Tu-Wee-Kah were
the equivalent of the Green Berets of their time and they were the ones who
were sent in first to stealthily assassinate the opposition and disable key
positions, the rest of the tribe would then attack.  Pakawa has been in many
battles and he is proud of the many scalps that he has collected.

and keep the streets safe.  By night, she is a Vigilante, fighting in a
different court, where she is judge, jury, and executioner!  Danja grew up on
the wrong side of the tracks, but she studied hard in school and became an
exceptional student.  As a result, she was persecuted by her classmates and had
to quickly learn the laws of the street to survive.  When Danja graduated from
high school (as Valedictorian) she was quickly offered multiple scholarships
for her academic and athletic abilities.  She worked hard in college, and
studied self-defense and exotic weapons to increase her street fighting skills.
She earned straight A's and was accepted to Harvard Law School, were she
specialized in criminal law.  Graduating at the top of her class, she was
offered many prestigious positions, but decided to take a job with the District
Attorney in the inner city instead.  She soon realized how corrupt the justice
system really was and decided to use her street fighting skills to take the law
into her own hands.  Danja has mixed the martial arts she learned in college
with her streetfighting tactics and her personal preference for a weapon, the
bolas.  These bolas have been modified to administer her brutal brand of
justice, giving them a real bang for their buck.

H.  Angus MacGreggor

Age:     26          Height:  6' 1"
Weight:  210 lbs.    Style:   Brawling

Description:

Angus MacGreggor is the Blacksmith of his village Loch Katrine, as was his
father and his father's father before him.  The constant pounding of hot iron
has made Angus a burly man.  Legend of Angus' strength quickly spread to the
other clans of Scotland and as a result he was constantly challenged to tests
of strength.  These tests included wrestling, boxing, and weight lifting.
Angus always won easily, but he always had high praise for his opponents,
especially at their funerals.  Angus soon discovered that he loved to brawl and
became obsessed with fighting.  Any pub Angus visited soon encountered a severe
lack of both furnishings and patrons.  Angus soon ran out of those who would
challenge him, causing him much anger.  This anger grew inside of him every
day, like a fire consuming his soul.  Now Angus has dedicated his life to
finding a worthy opponent, one who might be able to give him the fight of his
life.

Move List:

  Throw:  P + B
  Caber Toss:  Hold C then press D, U
  Headbutt:  Hold C then press D, F
  Fireball:  Hold C then press B, BU, U, UF, F

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.  Lord Gyaku

Age:     34          Height:  5' 11"
Weight:  154 lbs.    Style:   Ninjitsu

Description:

The evil Possessed Ninja you must defeat to keep the portal to the Demon World
closed.  Gyaku has spent many years in Ninja Training.

Move List:

  Elbow:  P + F
  Throw:  P + B
  Teleport:  Hold C and press U, U
  Fireball:  Hold C and press B, BD, D, DF, F
  Whirlwind Kick:  Hold C and press B, B, F, F
  Death Move:  Hold C and press B, U

Notes:

You will not face Lord Gyaku in the Easy difficulty.  The match with Gyaku is
a best of FIVE.

Use the Jump Kick/Sweep Combo to defeat Lord Gyaku.  If he manages to get some
distance between you, he'll repeatedly throw fireballs, use your Teleport to
get close to him.

When you win, if you are playing on Hard or Ninja God, then DO NOT USE A DEATH
MOVE OR ANY OTHER ATTACK!  If you do, then you won't be able to face Demon
Gyaku and get the best ending.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J.  Demon Gyaku

Age:     ?           Height:  7' 2"
Weight:  340 lbs.    Style:   Mauling

Description:

Gyaku has become possessed by the most powerful demon in the netherworld.

Move List:

  Earthquake:  K (must be away from opponent)
  Shake & Toss:  K (must be near opponent)
  Firebreath:  P + F
  Uppercut:  P
  Jump Kick:  U,P or UF, P
  Slam & Taunt:  P + B
  Death Move:  Hold C then rotate joypad clockwise twice

Notes:

In order to faced Demon Gyaku and get the true ending, you must play the game
in Hard or Ninja God difficulty.  When you defeat Lord Gyaku, DO NOT USE A
DEATH MOVE OR ANY OTHER ATTACK!  You will then face Demon Gyaku in a best of
FIVE match.

If you die fighting Demon Gyaku, when you continue, you'll have to fight Lord
Gyaku again!

I find the easiest way to defeat Demon Gyaku is to use the Jump Kick/Sweep
Kick Combo.  Try to stay close to him so he won't use his Earthquake attack.

Defeat Demon Gyaku to get the best ending.

VII.   Game Review

Back in the 90's, tournament fighters were all the rage.  Street Fighter II and
Mortal Kombat ruled the arcades and everybody and their mom was trying to cash
in.  Kasumi Ninja by Hand Made Software is another cheap Mortal Kombat knockoff
that fails to live up to the source material.

Kasumi Ninja has all the hallmarks of a Mortal Kombat clone: lots of blood,
fatalities, and digitized graphics.  Unfortunately they forget to add tight
controls and overall fun!

In Kasumi Ninja, you start out as one of the ninja twins: Habaki and Senzo.
The object of the game is to defeat other fighters from around the world and
absorb their energy so you can become strong enough to defeat the villain,
Gyaku.

The selection screen is your first clue that something is wrong with this game.
Instead of the normal character portraits and cursor, you are placed inside a
3D room with statues, the statues have no names or captions, you have to press
the C button to see that.  First you choose your fighter, at the beginning
Habaki and Senzo are the only fighters available.  Unlock games like Super
Smash Bros., the fighters are NOT permanently unlocked, you have to do it
every single time you begin a new game.  Once you have chosen your fighter,
you choose your opponent.  You do this before every fight, and it gets very
annoying.  The 3D engine for this part is actually nicely done, it's a shame
Hand Made Software didn't release an FPS for the Jaguar.  My theory is that
the 3D engine was created by the programmers when they were learning how to
program the Jaguar and decided to include it in the game so it wouldn't be
"wasted" or something.

Once you've selected your fighter and opponent, you enter the combat zone and
the game finally begins.  The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics
are amazing, the digitized fighters look better than the ones in Mortal Kombat
(the ARCADE version!).  The backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous.

None of that matters once the fighting begins.  Within seconds, you'll be
struggling with the controls and understanding why everyone hates this game!
Awful is the only way to describe them, they are very sluggish and stiff.
There is a noticeable delay between the time you press the button and when you
actually attack.  There is also a brief "cool down" time between kicks, you 
have to wait a few moments before you can kick again.  Jump kicks are awkward,
you have to press the kick button right after you jump or you won't kick.  In
order to perform special moves, you have to hold down the C button and then do
the joypad input.  I also find it strange that not all characters can do all of
the basic moves.  For example, Thundra can't do a roundhouse and Angus can't do
sweep kicks.

The AI is very unbalanced, you'll struggle even on the easiest difficulty,
unless you resort to cheap tricks like using repeated jump kicks or fireballs.
The programmers must have been huge wrestling fans, you'll be pummeling the CPU
and have almost won, when suddenly he'll wake up and unload a flurry of special
attacks to steal the victory.   

The game is really short, even shorter depending on the difficulty level.  On
Easy, the game ends after defeating the six other regular fighters.  On Normal,
you can fight Gyaku, but you still don't "win".  On Hard and Ninja God, after
defeating Lord Gyaku, you then face his true form.

The blood and gore in Kasumi Ninja is really over the top.  Not only does every
blow you land cause your opponent to spew blood, but the lifebars are actually
bloody swords that drip down onto the playing field.  The fatalities are also
pretty graphic.  The game carries an M rating and includes a parental "Gore
Code" option, where a code has to be entered to play with the gore turned on.
Of course, there's nothing stopping a kid from entering his own code.

Bottom line: even avid fans of the Atari Jaguar should avoid this game, if you
are looking for a fighting game, I recommend Ultra Vortek.


Pros

+  The graphics are actually pretty good, the digitized fighters look better
   than the ones in Mortal Kombat and the backgrounds are absolutely gorgeous!
+  The 3D engine during the selection screen is actually well done, it's a
   shame Hand Made Software didn't make an FPS for the Jaguar instead.

Cons

-  Only two fighters available at the start and they are palate swaps.
-  The controls are just awful.
-  Only get two continues per game.
-  The AI is really cheap.
-  The manual doesn't list the characters' special moves.
