1. Introduction
===============================================================================
Stand at attention, soldier! You're in the world of Cannon Fodder, a quirky
little war-game that puts you in command of a squadron of soldiers. Your
commanders will send you everywhere from the jungles of Nam to the frozen
wastelands of Antarctica. So strap on your boots and get ready to gun down
the opposing army with your rifles, destroy enemy buildings with hand grenades,
and take down enemy artillery with bazooka rockets. As the tagline goes, "War
has never been this much fun!" It's time to enter the warzone, and this guide
will help you do just that, albeit in a nearly repetitive, monotonous way.

Because Cannon Fodder is a multi-platform title (SNES, PC, Amiga, Genesis, 3D0
and Jaguar), I have based this walkthrough on the SNES version of the game.
However, I have played a bit of the PC version and it is exactly the same. I am
uncertain of the other platforms, so please point some things out to me if
something appears different on the other consoles.


===============================================================================
2. Controlling your Troopers
===============================================================================
SNES Controls:

On Boot Hill:
Select - Enter main menu
Start - Begin the mission

On the battlefield:
B - Fire 
A - Move troopers
X - Switch between grenades and rockets, if any
Y - Look at world map
L/R - Toggle between divided squadrons
Start - Pause the game and enter side menu
Select - Not used

To move your troopers, point the cursor in the direction you want them to move
and press the move button. To fire, point the cursor in the direction you want
and press the fire button. To use a grenade or a rocket, hold down the fire
button and press the move button. Take note that grenades and rockets are
unusable inside vehicles.

To board a vehicle, move your cursor over it until it changes to an arrow
pointing into a square, and then press the move button. Move the vehicle the
same way you would a trooper. You can pick up speed by holding down the move
button longer. Fire the vehicle's weapon (if it has one) with the fire button.
Leave a vehicle by moving the cursor over it until it changes to an arrow
pointing outside a square, and then press the move button. Choppers must be on
land first before you can leave them. To land a chopper, move the cursor over
the chopper until it becomes an 'H' and then press the move button.

You can split your troopers up into 2 more different squads. To do so,
highlight the soldiers you want to split up, and then press the snake picture
above the soldier names. Keep in mind that new squads can take grenades and
bazookas. To change how many the new squad takes, toggle through the yellow
lines that appear around the grenade and bazooka icons. A solid line represents
all of that particular item. A dotted line is half, and no line is none of the
item. After you create separate squads, you can regroup them by moving the
troopers into each other.

To see a map of the level, press the icon on the bottom left corner. If you
want to restart the mission, press the white flag (Amiga/PC users will have to
press escape).


===============================================================================
3. Powerups and Obstacles
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Vehicles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jeep: A basic land vehicle for your troopers to travel fast. These provide
protection from enemy gunfire. Some jeeps may come with a mounted machine gun.

Ski-doo: A snowmobile for getting around the rough terrain. They work
similarly to jeeps. Some ski-doos may have a machine gun on the front.

Big Gun: A fixed turret that fires explosive shells. Depending on the level,
some big guns may be able to resist grenades and rockets. Whatever the case,
all big guns (or vehicles, for that matter) are vulnerable to shells and
heat-seeking missiles.

Tank: These war machines fire explosive shells and provide considerable
protection against enemy attacks. They move fairly slow.

Chopper: Helicopters provide a quick way of transportation and attack. These
come in three varieties: a simple transport chopper, a bomber, and an armed to
the teeth chopper with heat-seeking missiles. A chopper in the air can only be
destroyed by a heat-seeking missile, while a chopper on the ground is
vulnerable to any explosion.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. Supa-Dupa Boostas (powerups)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These powerups are rare to find. Personally, I have only found one of each
except for the bullet-proofa vest. I haven't seen any of those in the game!

Missile Boosta: Grab one of these to recieve a package of 50 heat-seeking
missiles. These look like yellow triangles.

Rank Boosta: This 4-star icon will grant the one who touches this an
immediate rank boost to General.

Bullet-Proofa Vest: This little item turns your trooper into an unstoppable
killing machine for the remainder of the phase. Note that the trooper is immune
to any attack, not just bullets.

Trooper Boosta: The lucky soldier who manages to stumble onto one of these
receives a missile, rank, and bullet-proofa powerups. They look like a yellow
S, and are quite rare.

Troop Boosta: One of these will provide the whole boosta package for the whole
squadron. These are the ones with double S's.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c. Enemies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Soldiers: Your basic grunt. Waves upon waves of these guys will be sent to gun
down your squadron. Some may be more aggressive than others, depending on the
mission. They might toss a grenade in your direction in the later levels, so
watch out.

Bazooka Sniper: These guys will stand in one spot, waiting for you to get in
their sights so they can blow you to smithereens. Try to send a single soldier
to take them out, as one soldier will be a smaller target to hit. Also try
throwing grenades from behind walls and trees or counter-snipe them.

Enemy Artillery: Enemy Tanks and Big Guns will attempt to blow you up with
heat-seeking missiles. Use caution when advancing on them, and try to destroy
them one at a time.

Engineers: Jeeps and Ski-doos are what the engineers handle. Shoot them with a
bazooka before they notice your presence and begin to run you through.

Enemy Air Force: These pilots will patrol the area, killing anything on sight.
Send them flying six feet under with a heat-seeking rocket in the air, or wait
for the chopper to land so that you can blow it up with no hassle.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d. Mission Objective Descriptions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kill All Enemy: Just what it sounds like. This includes enemy troopers and
vehicles.

Destroy Enemy Buildings: Anything with a door that enemy troopers come out of
must be destroyed. Doors with metal plating must be destroyed by shells or
heat-seeking missiles.

Destroy Enemy Factory/Computer: A factory is just another building, but a
computer is a brownish glowing spherical structure.

Rescue All Hostages: Return all of the hostages that are being held captive.
Kill all the troopers surrounding the hostage, and then lead the hostage to the
MASH tent on the map. Remember that these hostages can't be killed, so feel
free to use them as human shields or whatnot.

Kidnap Enemy Leader: The same as rescuing a hostage, basically.

Protect All Civilians: Don't let a single civilian die. The death of an
innocent will result in the immediate loss of the level.

Get Civilians Home: Innocent people are being held like caged animals. Your job
is to free them from their barricades and make sure they get home safe and
sound. Unlike the Rescue All Hostages objective, civilians will not follow you
and they can die.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
e. Soldier Ranks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A soldier's rank will determine how fancy his tombstone will be on Boot Hill,
if/when the soldier dies. Also, a higher-ranking soldier leads the squadron. If
two or more soldiers have the same rank, the number of kills is used to
determine leadership. The rank of a trooper will rise after every mission they
survive through. Take note that newly conscripted recruits will also have their
ranks slightly increased over missions due to 'training.'

Private: A single chevron.

Corporal: Two chevrons.

Sergeant: Three chevrons.

Staff Sergeant: A chevron and a curved line connecting the bottom ends.

Sergeant 1st Class: A chevron and two curved lines.

Master Sergeant: A chevron and three curved lines.

Sergeant Major: A chevron, three curved lines, and a star.

Specialist 4: A picture of an eagle.

Specialist 6: A picture of an eagle and two curved lines on the top.

Warrant Officer: A gray rectangle, with two dark gray rectangles in the middle.

Chief Warrant Officer: A golden rectangle, with two rectangles in the middle.

Captain: Two silver stripes.

Major: A golden star.

Colonel: A picture of a silver eagle.

Brigadier General: A single silver star.

General: Four silver stars.


===============================================================================
4. General Tips
===============================================================================
-Don't rush blindly into enemy territory. Consult your map, and then scout
around with a single soldier before you bring in the cavalry.

-When you have to destroy enemy buildings to complete a level, try not to waste
your grenades and rockets needlessly as you may need all of them for buildings.

-When you see any artillery or bazooka snipers, consider using a solitary
soldier to take them out. By using one soldier, you make yourself a smaller
target.

-If you find your soldiers are about to die, quickly pause the game (Start
button for consoles, P key for Amiga/PC) and restart the phase. This helps if
you want your sergeant to live to see another promotion, or for those pesky
missions where you start right next to enemy artillery.

-Remember that you begin the game with 15 soldiers, and recieve a replenishment
of 15 soldiers for every mission. Try not to get the newbies slaughtered on
their first day of combat.

-When splitting up forces, be careful about how you distribute the grenades and
rockets. If left alone, a squadron might use up their grenades and rockets
for taking out nearby soldiers. Take all the weapons for yourself if you need
to destroy buildings, or keep the other squadron in a safe no-fire zone.

-You may find levels with holes in the ground, where more and more enemy
soldiers can crawl out. If you have to kill all of the enemy to complete the
level, you might want to keep a squadron near these holes so that you are able
to finish the level more quickly.

-Deep water requires your troopers to use both arms to swim. Try to avoid deep
water as much as you can if you spot any enemy soldiers or artillery nearby.

-Watch out for mines and harpoons. Mines can be destroyed by shooting them, but
harpoons are a bit harder to bypass. These traps show up on your screen as very
tiny pixels, so sweep the area with rifle fire to be safe from mines at least.

-Unless you're going for a no-kill game or something of the sort, try not to
get too attached to your soldiers. Although it may be pretty keen to see little
Jools get his 4-star General's badge, as the title of the game implies, use 'em
as cannon fodder :).


===============================================================================
5. Missions Walkthrough
===============================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 The Sensible Initiation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You begin the game with 15 recruits. Although the game may tell you 13, I also
include the soldiers that are currently in action.

Phase 1 of 1: It's a Jungle Out There
-------------------------------------
Briefing: 2 soldiers must Kill All Enemy

Get used to the controls in this newbie-friendly level. Move around the tiny
map and kill all of the the enemy soldiers that you see. You can try dividing
your troopers into different squadrons just for the hell of it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.2 Onward Virgin Soldiers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 30 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 2: Bridge Over the River Pie
---------------------------------------
Briefing: 3 soldiers must Kill All Enemy

There are more soldiers here, but the level is still easy to complete. Begin by
clearing the area nearby of enemy soldiers. Make your way to the south-west
corner of the map and take care of the soldiers there. Move west and eliminate
any opposition that you see.

After you clear the southern land mass, begin to cross the river. It's safer
and faster if you cross the bridge, since you're defenseless in deep water.
Move west and circle around the forest, shooting at any soldier you see. Try
not to rush forward, as the enemy does outnumber you and one of your soldiers
might wind up getting shot.


Phase 2 of 2: Trash Enemy HQ
----------------------------
Briefing: 3 soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

There is a lot of water in this level, so try to stay on the edges of land. If
you have to cross over water, one good technique to hold down the fire button
while your troops attempt to swim across. This way, you can immediately start
firing at any soldiers once you reach land.

Quickly fire at the approaching soldiers in the starting area. Follow the river
down to the bottom corner of the map, making sure to stay on land as much as
you can. Once you reach the south-west corner, fire at any soldiers coming your
way and move toward the east. Here, you will see a building with troops pouring
out. To destroy it, you either pick up the crate of grenades beside the
building or just shoot the crate itself. Be careful when destroying it, as the
door will go flying in the south-west direction and the roof may be blown off,
landing in a random area. I recommend moving north of the building in order to
avoid the resulting debris. Take note that for a building to be declared
destroyed, the door must be blown off.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.3 Antarctic Adventure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 45 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 1: Blast It's Cold
-----------------------------
Briefing: 4 soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

There are four buildings that must be taken care of in order to complete the
mission. Check your map and move toward the south west building. Don't worry
about dying when you fall down the cliff, because your troops can handle it.
You will see a crate of grenades near the building, but don't shoot it. There
are 3 more buildings that you have to destroy, so clear the area of any enemies
while you snatch the crate. Move back a distance and toss a grenade near the
door of the building. Continue on north until you see the building above you,
then destroy that building.

Drop down to the southern part of the map, killing any opposition that you see.
Move toward the east while still in the south area. Point your cursor to the
north east, and throw a grenade at the building. Now, climb up the ramp and 
move north east. Head to the final building at the north, but watch out because
a lot of soldiers will be waiting for you. Once you destroy the final building,
finish off any remaining soldiers on the level. Remember that if there are
still buildings to destroy but you can't find enough explosives to do the job,
you will have to restart the mission.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.4 Supa Smashing Namtastic
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 60 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 4: Beachy Head
--------------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

4 buildings lie in each of the corners of the map. Start the level by going to
the south east building. Grab the crate near the building, and then proceed to
blow it up. Move toward the north east building and destroy it. Now, send your
troopers west, across the river. Watch out for the brown spot on the beach, as
this is quicksand. Move to the north west building and shoot the crate. Finally
proceed to the south west building and detonate it to complete the level.


Phase 2 of 4: Pier Pressure
---------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

A simple mission with only one building to detonate. Quickly make short work
of the approaching soldiers when you start, and then move your troopers toward
the east. Move down to the bridge, and then throw a grenade at the building.
Cross the river if you need to take care of any remaining soldiers.

Note: From this point on, you will begin with at least one grenade for every
trooper you start with in each level.


Phase 3 of 4: Village People
----------------------------
Briefing: 5 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

There are three things that make their first appearance in this level:
civilians, indestructible underground holes where enemy soldiers keep coming,
and a different kind of building you have to destroy. Also, soldiers now have
the ability to lob grenades at you, so be careful.

To start off, move toward the west and then go south over the hill. While
going south, you will see a hole in the ground on the western side. Countless
soldiers will crawl out of this hole, and there is no way to destroy it.
Because one of your objectives is to kill all enemy soldiers, you might want
to consider splitting up your troopers to guard this area. You may also see
a civilian or two near the hole. You can shoot them if you want, since they
aren't a part of the objectives of this level. However, be warned that some
civilians may begin attacking you.

From the hole, make your way to the south eastern building. Take the east path
all the way to the river, and then move south. Destroy the building, and then
return to the hole area. Move south toward the huts and destroy the enemy
building (the one  in the north west corner). The only debris that flys from
these types of buildings is only the door, so you don't have to worry about the
roof landing on you. Once the building is destroyed, scour the map for any
remaining soldiers. 


Phase 4 of 4: Quicksand
-----------------------
Briefing: 5 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

As the name may imply, make sure to avoid the brown areas that we all know and
love/hate as quicksand. Make your way to the north west corner, but watch out
for the mine trap. It is a small grey pixel north east of the solitary palm
tree, so stand a fair distance from it and shoot it. Continue on to the east
while avoiding the quicksand. Once you get past the quicksand fields, make your
way to the building in the south. Destroy it, and then hunt around for any
soldiers you may have missed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.5 Those Vicious Vikings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 75 recruits at this point in the game.


Phase 1 of 3: The Valley of Ice
-------------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

A very narrow and simple map. Send your soldiers westbound, killing anything in
sight and blowing up any building you see. Be careful of the area after the
last two buildings, as you'll have your first encounter with bazooka snipers.
To deal with them, you can use rockets of your own if you have any. Another
method which you'll be using commonly is to make a squadron of one soldier, and
then use that squadron to eliminate the bazooka snipers. By doing this, you
will have a better chance of avoiding explosives. There are 4 snipers that you
have to deal with.


Phase 2 of 3: Barmy Bazookas
----------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

There are quite a number of bazooka snipers in this level, so start off by
making a one-man squadron and give that squadron all the grenades. Take your
one-man squadron to the building directly west. Take down the bazooka sniper
then blow up the building. Drop down the cliff and head east. Destroy the
building there, then hug the east side and follow the path south until you
reach the forest area. Take care of the building and grab the rocket packs
nearby (you may want to spilt a few rockets with the other squadron just in
case your one-man squad dies).

From the forest area, move west and kill the bazooka sniper that lies in wait.
Move north across the small piece of land, and then quicky find and kill the
bazooka sniper that stands a bit to the north west. From here, cross the water
and then fire at the bazooka sniper near the hole in the ground. Move west and
take out yet another sniper and the building beside him. Now, head back toward
the hole in the ground and start going to the north west corner of the level.
Three more bazooka snipers are waiting for you here, so use your own bazooka
rockets if you have any. Finish off any other enemy soldiers you can find.


Phase 3 of 3: My Beautiful Skidu
--------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

This map is littered with snipers, but thankfully, you don't have to kill them
all in order to finish the map. Only two buildings must be destroyed, but one
of the buildings requires a daring jump with a skidoo. Like the previous level,
create a one or two-man squadron and give the squad half the supplies. Take
down the building directly south, and then continue south via the narrow path.
As you move south, watch out for the sniper near the bottom corner of the map.

Oh wow, a skidoo lies in wait for you! Don't hop into it just yet, though.
First, move west and take out the bazooka sniper, and then return for the
building and the skidoo. You'll have to blow up the barbed wire to get to it,
so be careful not to accidentally detonate the skidoo.

Practise moving with the skidoo now that you are controlling it. Move toward
the west edge of land and drive up and down the pathway. The bazooka sniper
north of the ramp shouldn't be much of a threat now that you're in a speedy
skidoo. Drive over him as part of your practice. Once you're ready, prepare to
jump over the ramp. Back up as much as you can and then drive over the ramp
toward the western landmass. Remember that if you mess up the jump and fall in
the water, you can conserve your soldiers by quickly exiting the vehicle before
it completely sinks, or smack the level restart option.

Once you're across the river, quicky take care of the three bazooka snipers
near the eastern edge. After that's done, exit the vehicle near the building
and take it out to complete the mission.

Note: From this point on, you will begin with at least 2 rockets for every
soldier that you start with on each level.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.6 Westward Ho
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 90 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 2: The Grand Canyon
------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

This map isn't too difficult, but you might get a casualty or two if you're
not careful. Take your troops to the east, where one of the three buildings
stand. Destroy the building, and then cross over the bridge. Be careful that
you don't fall in one of the holes.

Hug the eastern side of the map, and move south toward another building. Shoot
the crates and take care of the sniper beside the building if the flying
debris doesn't kill him. Now, keep on the road and move toward the structure
in the west. You might want to split your forces and ready your bazooka
because a sniper will be waiting for you in the south west. Destroy the
building and take out the last couple of soldiers.


Phase 2 of 2: Trigger Happy
---------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

A few snipers are stalking the battlefield, but you don't have to engage any of
them at all. Send your squad toward the building in the west direction.
Ignoring the sniper near the structure, toss a grenade and head toward the
next building in the south east. Watch out for chasms while you make your way
there. Once you've blown up that building, move to the east and then north
toward the fenced area. You don't have to walk around or make an entrance. Just
kill the soldiers you deem threatening and toss a grenade toward the upper left
building.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.7 Greenland Blood
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 105 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 3: The Slippery Stairway
-----------------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

This level is a bit hard to manage, since you're literally fighting an uphill
battle against a few well-placed snipers. Make a one-man squadron and give him
all the supplies. Start by moving this squad to the west, where a sniper and a
soldier tunnel both reside. Take the sniper out, then quickly move to the
buildings beside the ramp in the north. Eliminate the sniper, and then destroy
the two buildings. Make sure to use grenades, because your rockets may come in
handy for taking out any snipers. Don't worry if you run out of explosives, as
there is a crate of grenades at the very top.

Ready your rockets and climb up the ramp, keeping your cursor in the north
direction. Kill the sniper you see, and then immediately move west and take out
another sniper. Don't cross the water yet, but stay in the shallow water and
move north as much as you can. Point your cursor north to find a sniper near
the left side of the ramp across the water. Fire a rocket, and then proceed to
move farther up. Climb the next ramp and fire at the building to the right,
then continue left and move up another ramp. Destroy the building you see, and
then point your cursor a bit to the upper right corner. Fire a rocket at the
sniper, then finish off the remaining enemy forces at the top. Scout the level
for any surviving troopers.


Phase 2 of 3: Return to Reykjavik
---------------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

A fairly simple level to complete, but it can be a bit annoying due to the
three underground tunnels in the north, south and center of the map. Consider
placing squads in these areas. Also, be wary of civilians here as they are able
to kill your troopers.

Take your squad and move toward the igloo directly in the south. Keep going
south, but go through the path in between the trees and stay near the edge of
the lake in the west. Continue moving down toward the enemy structure and
destroy it. Now hug the forest on the right and move up toward a narrow path.
Keep on the lookout for sniper to the right. Stay behind the trees and toss a
grenade. Don't worry about the other sniper behind him; he'll spot you and try
to fire, but will blow himself up. Keep going to the right side of the map,
where the rest of the enemy buildings lie. Save for the hordes of soldiers
that you might be facing, there are no more dangerous obstacles in your way.
Destroy the last 3 buildings in the east and north east, and then hunt down all
the soldiers in the level.


Phase 3 of 3: Evil Knievel
--------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy all Buildins and Protect All Civilians

This is your first level where you must not let any innocents die. Thankfully,
it's still an easy mission save for the driving part. Remember that if an
innocent dies, you must restart the level.

Start the level by creating a one-man squadron. Send him north toward the
skidoo, killing the enemy sniper the your way. Now you have a choice: you can
either re-group your squads or send your solitary soldier on a solo mission.
If you think you're going to mess up on driving the skidoo over the ramps, you
might want to use one soldier, since everyone in the vehicle will die when it
gets destroyed. If you're going to send only one trooper, make sure that the
trooper takes all of the grenades with him.

Take control of the machinegun-mounted skidoo and navigate through the winding
forest path. When you jump a ramp, try to keep your jeep in the middle as much
as possible. Speed by the snipers that are camping near the ramps, and quickly
make your way to the waterside. Once you reach the waterside, take the skidoo
up the narrow path to avoid the last snipers on the bottom. Now, exit the
vehicle and move across the water. Take out any threatening soldiers and throw
3 grenades at the buildings, making sure that the lone civilian doesn't get
killed by the resulting blasts.

5.8 Guerrilla Warfare
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 120 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 4: Have a Nice Trip
------------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Now that you're back in the jungle, you can expect some nasty things to rear
their heads. The enemy soldiers are aggresive in this mission, so watch your
step.

When you start the level, stand still until you see an explosion.
A sniper will try shooting you, but he'll get himself instead. Move toward the
north east corner, where a couple of soldiers are standing. Don't go into the
narrow pathway, though, as there are harpoon traps waiting for you. Let them
charge into your gunfire. Once you're finished here, move to the west.

Once you spot water on your screen, come to a dead stop. Let the enemy charge
you, and don't even think about crossing the bridge after they're dead. Not
only is the bridge path loaded with traps, but there is a sniper right across.
Take the sniper and the two buildings with rockets, and then kill any
remaining soldiers.


Phase 2 of 4: Bang Bang You're Dead
-----------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Immediately kill the sniper to the left of you, and then take your squadron to
the upper right corner of the map. Create a one-man squad, and give all those
supplies to that soldier. Ready your rockets and move left. Prepare to take
out two snipers to the left of the X landmark. Don't cross the river yet, but
head to the right and to the edge of the river. Keep your cursor south and get
rid of two snipers in the middle and bottom right corner. Move to the left
while still on the edge and kill the sniper on the building toward the bottom.
Finally, cross the river from the right side of the level.

Don't enter the big gun yet, but stay on the right side and move toward the
river edge. While moving slightly left, keep your cursor on the bottom in
order to spot three more snipers. Now, enter the big gun and take out all of
the five metal-plated buildings. Once that's done, eliminate the remaining
resistance with your other squad. Remember that you can clear the area of
soldiers around a big gun by firing just a small distance away from yourself.


Phase 3 of 4: Deliverance
-------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

After one look at your map, your first thought would be to navigate your way 
through the forest. It's funny to find the forest devoid of any soldiers until
you find that there are harpoon traps aplenty within the narrow areas. When
you have to squeeze through a small area, try to hug the trees on the top in
order to avoid the harpoons. Stay away from the marked pixels if you can help
it. Also watch for the mine trap near the end of the forest maze.

Once you're out of the twisting forest and at the river, stay on the right and
continue down. After you hit the bottom right corner, move toward the left.
Behind the plant, you'll find a Missile Boosta. Before you return to the river,
move west as much as you can and take out the sniper with a grenade or your
heat-seeking missiles. Now, return to the river. Take note that if you decide
to divide your squad up, only one will carry the heat-seeking missiles.

Now all you have to do is move down the river cautiously, as a few snipers are
in the area. You might be safer on the bottom side of the river. Don't hesitate
to use your new found heat-seeking missiles. Once you push your way into the
bottom left corner, destroy the buildings and kill off the soldiers.


Phase 4 of 4: Jeep Jump
-----------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Move into the crevice below and toss a grenade at the building you see. Now,
keep going to the right, but watch out for the enemy jeep. If it speeds toward
you, move back so that it will get stuck in the trees. Scrap it with a grenade
or a rocket. Continue east, and stay behind the trees in order to avoid rocket
fire from below. In the upper right corner, you will see a building and a jeep.
Before you detonate the building, move the jeep away. Make sure to use a rocket
because you'll need your grenades. At this point, you may want to create a one
or two person squad to complete the rest of the level. Don't move the jeep
south yet.

Take your troopers to the building in the south, and clear the area of snipers.
There is one directly right of the hut, one below and to the left (will most
likely kill himself), and another directly below the hut. Don't fall down the
cliff, as you will die. Once you've taken the snipers out, go back and retrieve
the jeep.

Now it's time for the jeep jump. Take the jeep and drive down the cliff in the
area of water, which is directly below the hut. The jeep will sink down below,
but before it sinks, quickly move your cursor over the jeep and evacuate your
squad. You might want to make sure that no enemies are around in this area as
well.

Cross the river and go south toward the other hut. From the hut, go west until
you see an enemy building. Throw a grenade at it, and if you have any left,
throw another at the sniper up top. Now, return to the river and follow it down
to the big gun. Enter and fire away at the three buildings.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.9 Great Scott Good Shot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 135 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 2: Round the Garden
------------------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Throw your grenade at the sniper directly below you (and at the building if you
can hit it). Now enter the machinegun-mounted skidoo and quickly take down the
sniper to the right. Continue right and make your way to the bottom right
corner of the map. While avoiding shells, take out the sniper in the corner.
Move toward the right side of the level and park the skidoo.

This part of the level can get very tricky, indeed. Continue on by clearing the
immediate area of soldiers and then move west toward the big gun. Knock it out
with a rocket and keep moving west. You will see an enemy skidoo here, but it
will usually move up and fire at the igloo. Take this opportunity to fire a
rocket at it. Now, your last piece of machinery lies in the east. Fire a rocket
at the last big gun. Once you've done that, take care of the enemy army and
structures. There is a crate of grenades beside the igloo.


Phase 2 of 2: In at the Deep End
--------------------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

This level gets REALLY ANNOYING REALLY FAST. You will need a fair amount of
luck to knock down all the enemy big guns. Grab the two crates of grenades and
ready your rockets. Swim toward the north east. You will see a small piece of
land, so send your lone trooper there and keep your cursor north. Once your
soldier makes it on the land, fire your rockets at the two big guns as fast as
possible. Move north onto the land and collect the rocket pack there. Ready
your rockets again, and move to the small island. Keep on the edge of the
island and point your cursor west. Fire two more rockets at the big guns you
see. Now, head into the big gun and destroy the building. Make sure to take out
any soldiers who might be waiting for you to come out of the big gun.

Move south, and get onto the upper edge of the island with the seal. Keep your
cursor south and fire at the big gun you see. Move to the lower edge and fire
another rocket at the big gun. Hug the left of the map and cautiously move to
the right. You will have to take out three more big guns with your grenades.
Push into the right landmass ever so slightly, and toss everything you have at
the big guns.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.10 One Gigantic Dust Bowl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 150 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 5: Square Dance
--------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

This is a fairly simple level, regardless of the chopper that you will see for
the first time. Ready your rockets and send your guys toward the first building
to your right. Fire at the rocket pack, and then take out the bazooka sniper to
the right of the building. Now, all that is left is to destroy the chopper,
buildings and soldiers. The chopper is of the troop-transport variety, so it
shouldn't be much of a threat. It is vulnerable to an explosive when it is on
the ground. Also, watch out for another sniper at the bottom of the level.


Phase 2 of 5: Penny for the Guy
-------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Immediately take your troops above the building to the right of you. Destroy
this building and the next one to the right of you with grenades, and then
ready your rockets. Go back to the starting point and keep your cursor down.
Fire at the big gun you see there, and then take out the last couple of
buildings to your left. Move your troopers right and cross the bridge, making
sure to avoid the holes and the harpoon trap at the other end (it will be in
the middle).

Continue going south, firing rockets at the two big guns you approach. Go
across both metal fences area and move your troops up. Keeping your cursor to
the left, eliminate the sniper that you will see. Now step into the wooden
fence area and destroy the building there. Be careful, as a big gun is
stationed at the western part of the level. Destroy it, and finish off any
remaining soldiers.


Phase 3 of 5: Tanky in the Middle
---------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings and Protect All Civilians

There are two buildings on each side of the fence that you must destroy. Don't
enter the jeep yet, but ready your rockets. Move your troopers right and take
out the big gun on the far side. Blow up the buildings, and hop into the jeep.
Use the ramp to jump over the fence, then quickly make your way to the ramp on
the right while ignoring the enemy artillery. Jump over the fence and get out
of the jeep. Use your rockets to destroy the last two buildings and hope that
a civilian doesn't get caught in the explosion.


Phase 4 of 5: If It Moves Kill It
---------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

You will spot a tank and a sniper directly north of your position. Take cover
behind the building by moving your troops to the little green bush. Wait for
the tank to charge and blow itself up, and then create a one-man squad. Use
this guy to immediately destroy the building in the south west and the north.
Keep away from the tank in the north west. You will most likely not need to use
the big gun, so don't worry about it getting destroyed. Be careful of the four
snipers that guard it though, and watch out for the mine trap near the south
end of the map. Hopefully, when you make your move north, game lag will kick in
and allow you to kill the snipers easily.


Phase 5 of 5: A Good Hard Tank
------------------------------
Briefing: 6 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Finally, you get to make use of a tank! Unfortunately, this level won't let you
walk away with a tank unharmed. You immediately begin next to a big gun. If it
fires at you before you can order your troops, quickly restart the level in
order to avoid casualties. Destroy the big gun and follow the path up the road,
ignoring all the enemy buildings. Ready your rockets, and move until you reach
the end. At the north end near the road corner, a big gun will be waiting. Take
it out and move left from the road corner. There is yet another big gun to be
destroyed here. Once that's done, enter the tank and start smashing all the
buildings down. Be careful of the last big gun on the eastern side of the map.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.11 Jungle More Jungle
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 165 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 3: Lord of the Flies
-------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

From your starting position, ready your rockets and move your troops through
the south west path. Go west, past the quicksand fields. Keep going west until
you hit the edge of the level, then continue south through the narrow path.
Push your way toward the south eastern corner, and destroy the buildings there.
Watch out for the big gun that is located near the building on the far right
side. The chopper should not give you any problems.


Phase 2 of 3: Whopper Chopper
-----------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Get Civilian Home

If the chopper gets you in its sights before you're in the tank, you might want
to restart the level as soon as possible. This chopper is able to bomb you with
grenades, and it's hard to shake it off your tail.

Quickly move your soldiers a bit to the right in order to avoid the big gun at
the bottom. Cross the river and toss a grenade at the big gun over the trees.
Move down the narrow path and keep your cursor down. Destroy the big gun beside
the building. Now, you must quickly cross the river and hop into the tank.
Immediately take out the big guns on the east side. Cross the bridge and fire
at the tank to the north. Now destroy the enemy building if you wish, then wait
for the chopper to land. Destroy it, and then head for the barricade. Fire at
it and let the civilian escape to the south east hut.


Phase 3 of 3: Donkeytastic
--------------------------
Briefing: 5 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Again, you will face bombers on this level. If one starts to pursue you,
consider immediately restarting the level. On this level, I find speed to be
of the essence. Take your guys south until you see a big gun on the left side.
Toss a grenade, and continue west. Take the top path and enter the chopper you
see there. Now, fly toward the north side of the map until you see an X. Don't
land yet, but find a suitable position close to it. Wait for the enemy chopper
to land, then quickly land your chopper and destroy it. Be careful that you
don't accidently crash into it when it approaches. Once you've finished it off,
all you have to do is fly around the map and eliminate the big guns in the
area. Make sure to land in safe areas when making your approach. Take out the
huts, too.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.12 Chiller Thriller Killer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 180 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 6: An Icicle Made for Two
------------------------------------
Briefing: 2 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

The most frustrating thing about this level are the vehicles that you'll be up
against. Select your rockets and move east, keeping your cursor pointed right.
Fire at the skidoo you see before it spots you, then quickly continue east,
toward the igloo. Avoid the bomber chopper as much as you can. Move south of
the igloo and enter the tank you see. Now, take your time and destroy the three
buildings on the north side of the map.


Phase 2 of 6: Tank You Very Much
--------------------------------
Briefing: 2 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy

The first half of this level is easy. Hop into the tank right next to you, and
destroy everything at the southern end of the level. Be careful near the top of
the land mass, as three big guns and a tank will be waiting for you. Destroy
all the buildings and park the tank near the hole. You might want to keep one
guy in the tank because you'll be facing a sniper. If you do this, split your
supplies up evenly.

Clear the south side of any soldiers. Now, stay on the left side and move north
across the water. You'll spot a sniper near the barricaded ramp. Try to get the
sniper to blow up the barricade for you, then move up the ramp and gun down
the sniper and any surrounding soldiers. Destroy the building, and clear the
top area of soldiers. Hunt down the rest of the resistance if any exist.


Phase 3 of 6: Death and Glory
-----------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Move north behind the trees and toss a grenade at the big gun there. Select
your rockets and move toward the spot where the big gun was and point your
cursor north. Let a rocket loose at the big gun and continue east. Keep your
cursor pointed east and fire a rocket at either the big gun itself or one of
the mines. Swim to the island and enter the chopper on the right. Ready your
grenades and fly toward the barricade in the south west. Land on the top side
of the barricade and toss a grenade at the sniper. Re-board the chopper and
land near the tank. Now, take the tank and clear the western land mass of any
life. Head back into the chopper and land it in the south east corner. Destroy
the building, and ready your rockets. Move north and make short work of the big
gun.


Phase 4 of 6: North Face of the Tiger
-------------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Stay behind the trees and throw grenades at the big guns directly below you and
to the left. Select your rockets and move to the right of the trees. Point your
cursor down and fire at the big gun. Get to the other side of the trees and
stay alert for two more big guns. There is one in the center on the south end
of the map and one a bit to the left. Destroy the building in the south east
and enter the helicopter. Take the chopper to the upper right corner and make
your way to the tank in the west. Enter the tank and quickly fire on the big
gun on your left. Now, clear each platform of buildings and enemies. Don't
worry about totalling the tank when you fall down the cliffs.


Phase 5 of 6: Rescue El Presidente
----------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Rescue Hostages

Because of the obscene amount of big guns in this level, you may want to
attempt it with one or two soldiers, and then restart if the going gets bad. At
any rate, choose your rockets and fire at the  big gun you see on the top left.</pre><pre id="faqspan-2">
Continue down while keeping your cursor on the left. Another two big guns for
you to destroy will soon appear to the left of the trees. Now, hug the right
side of the map and move down toward the unoccupied big gun. Take control of it
and fire at the approaching tank. Get out and move left. There will be two big
guns near the trees. One is above you, and the other is below the cliff.

Move past the trees and take control of the transport chopper. Land at the area
to the right of the hostage. Use a rocket to take care of the big gun, and then
throw two grenades - one for the soldier guarding the hostage and the other for
the building next to him. Don't worry about killing the hostage, 'cause you
can't. Enter the chopper and land right beside the hostage. Clear the area of
any soldiers and get the hostage to follow you into the chopper. Escort him to
the MASH tent in the south west.


Phase 6 of 6: Chill Out Iceman
------------------------------
Briefing: 6 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy, Destroy Enemy Buildings, and Destroy
Enemy Factor

This mission isn't too difficult. You may be wondering about the three lights
in this level. Don't worry about them; they're not necessary to complete this
level. If you divide your squad and press them down, you will summon the
chopper in the center of the level, but it is only a basic troop-transport.
I suppose the designers wanted you to use this troop transport to take your
troops to the big gun on the center building, but you can simply walk into it
from the ground...

Get your rockets out and fire at the big gun on the building due east. Cross
the water east and keep on the look out for another big gun above you. Destroy
the chopper on the right while it's still on the ground. Ignore the unoccupied
big gun and move north. There is a big gun dead ahead, so destroy it. Another
big gun lies on a building in the north west, so finish it off and enter the
unoccupied big gun in the center. You might want to keep a soldier or two out
of the big gun because you won't be able to get out of it.

Destroy the buildings around you, and then kill off any soldiers you see.
Once you've done that, fire at the factory door a couple of times until you
complete the mission. The door won't fly off, so destroying the factory must
be the last portion of the level to complete.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.13 More Moors
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 195 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 1: Much Much Moor
----------------------------
Briefing: 2 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

This is another of those annoying missions that require a bit of luck. You
will have your first encounter with big guns that are resistant to grenade and
rocket explosions, so your only chance is to make use of the big guns in the
level. Quickly fire at the soldiers swimming to you, then swim across and enter
the big gun. Fire at the enemy big gun, and then take out the sniper. Ready
your rockets and begin move slowly to the north. You will encounter a jeep
speeding in your direction, so fire a rocket at it. Destroy the building there,
then move right until you see an unoccupied big gun. Enter it and destroy the
enemy big gun and the building to your right side. Now scour the map for any
soldiers you may have missed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.14 Bomb Alley
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 210 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 3: It's All Mine
---------------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Take note that the enemy soldiers are aggressive and the enemy big guns are
not resistant to grenade/rocket fire in this mission. Get your rockets ready
and move east. Get ready to fire at the sniper across the chasm and then a big
gun to the north east of the bridge. Now move over the bridge and head to the
south west corner. Be careful to sweep the area of mines. Enter the chopper
and use its heat-seeking missiles to finish the level.


Phase 2 of 3: Sandy Crack
-------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Ready your rockets and prepare to destroy three big guns. From the starting
point on your map, there is one in the north west corner, one to the south and
one in the south east. Take care of the chopper once it lands on the ground.
Once that's done, destroy the buildings and gun down any enemy soldiers. You
can make use of the jeep to speed things up.


Phase 3 of 3: Airlift
---------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Rescue Hostages

Ready your rockets and enter the chopper on your right. Scout out the level
so you know where the big guns lie. Land in the far upper left corner and
quickly take the big gun down. Now all you have to do is move around in a
circle; start by moving east and destroy the big gun. Clear the area and get
the hostage to follow you, then repeat for the south and western areas. Take
the hostages to the chopper, and then escort them to the MASH outpost in the
south east.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.15 Get Orf Moi Land
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 225 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 3: Sheep Dip
-----------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy, Destroy Enemy Buildings, and Protect
All Civilians

Quickly move to the left side in order to avoid big gun fire. Move up and to
the left. Don't destroy the civilian building you see. Continue to the bottom
left corner, then move right and hop into the chopper. Land near the tank in
the upper right corner. Take control of the tank and move down, destroying the
three big guns stationed near the edge of the river. Destroy the building, and
hunt down the remaining enemy soldiers.


Phase 2 of 3: Chocs Away Chappies
---------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Move east onto the small piece of land that is out of range of the sniper you
see. Toss a grenade at the sniper, then make your way east. Watch out for the
sheep; they are rigged to explode upon contact. Move across the bridge and
destroy the building in the north. Toss a grenade over the trees at the sniper
above you, then enter the bomber chopper. Take care of the sniper squad in the
western area, then take one soldier and attempt to take over the empty big gun.
Immediately fire at the enemy big gun below, then destroy the buildings you
see.


Phase 3 of 3: A Bridge Too Far
------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy, Destroy Enemy Buildings, and Protect
All Civilians

Take your troopers into the transport chopper in the north. Do some recon work
so you know where everything is. Before you take a landing spot, take a visit
to the tank in the north end of the map. Fly into it and try to get the tank to
destroy itself. Don't worry, you are completely safe unless you accidentally
attempt to land. Land near the gray building in the east.

Get into the big gun and destroy the building, and then target the jeep on the
northern island. If you don't see it, hop back into your chopper and try to
lure it onto the edge. Take the chopper to the civilian buildings in the south
west. Send a solitary soldier to the big gun in the north and destroy the enemy
artillery. Now, it is all a matter of destroying the building in the south and
hunting down the rest of the enemy troopers.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.16 Going Underground
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 240 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 2: Eton Rifles
-------------------------
Briefing: 2 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Grenades will be useful in the underground levels. Take your troopers south and
take out the bazooka sniper on the left. Quickly kill the next sniper in the
upper left corner. Wait a while for the sniper behind the wall below you to
blow himself up. Move up and toss a grenade in between the sniper and the
building door. Continue on left and ready your rockets if you haven't already.

Blow the door above you, then take out the door on the left. Being careful not
to shoot the crate of grenades, pick them up and then fire a rocket at the
building door. Move on to the next room on the right. Be careful; there are
three mine traps and a bazooka sniper in here. Break down the door below and
keep your troops moving. Go on through the narrow path and detonate the
building door that you see. Keep going left and kill the sniper there with a
grenade or whatnot. Finally, take out the last enemy in the north.


Phase 2 of 2: Sewers Canal
--------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Take your troops to the water in the west. Get to the stairs and toss a grenade
at the sniper above you. Continue on left and destroy the enemy building there.
Climb up the staircase on the left. If you want a Rank Boosta, head to the
platform on the left. It is behind a barrier, which must be detonated 4 times.
In any case, just get to the big gun in the upper right corner and complete
your mission.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.17 The Moor The Merrier
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 255 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 1: No Way In
-----------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy, Destroy Enemy Buildings, and Rescue
Hostages

Destroy the building door directly to your right, then continue right until
you can see the hostage. Toss a grenade at the building to stop the flow of
enemies, then move south across the river. Don't cross the bridge left, but
move on down until you can see a sniper guarding the MASH outpost. Toss a
grenade his way, then throw a grenade at the building to the right of him.
Follow the path, and take a right when you see the barricade. Take this path
down, but stay alert for the sniper in the south east north of the map. Enter
the tank on your left, and head to the barricaded area. Take down the enemy
building on the north, then head for the hostage. Clear the area of enemy
soldiers, then take the hostage inside the tank. Return to the bridge and cross
it, being careful of the big gun on the bottom. Get out of the tank and head
down the river to the MASH outpost. If you missed any enemy soldiers, take them
out.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.18 Underpants Electric
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 270 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 5: Take Your Partners
--------------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Rescue Hostages

This simple level is made annoying by the waves and waves of enemy soldiers who
prevent the hostages from following you. Start by moving to the left. You'll
see a big gun to the left, so wait until it attempts to fire at you and blows
itself up in the process. Continue toward the empty big gun and fire at the
building door all the way on the left side. Get out and enter the narrow
corridor below you. Fire four rockets at the barrier and proceed to the area
with the hostage. Take out the sniper with your rifle, and then move south to
retrieve a rocket package. Keep the area clear of any enemy soldiers and take
the hostage back to the starting point.

When you reach the pool of water, fire four rockets in between both the
barriers below you. The hostages will most likely get stuck in the corner after
they cross the water, but that's okay. Continue to the right and destroy the
door you see. As you enter the room, watch out for the sniper on the top. Enter
the big gun and scrap the building door at the top and the metal door on the
bottom. Keep going down, and kill the sniper you see there (you might want to
throw a grenade because he'll aim for the wall as you walk through). Head into
the big gun and destroy the building door. Now return for the hostages and
escort them to the MASH outpost.


Phase 2 of 5: The Scroungers
----------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings and Protect All Civilians

Yet another simple level made difficult. This time around, it's a narrow
corridor with a large number of soldiers waiting for you to cross it. You can
take the jeep on the left if you wish. It's not essential to reach your
destination, but you may get shot by one of the civilians. Make your way to the
upper left corner, where you'll have to cross through a tiny space into a big
gun. Send your soldiers one at a time until someone can get inside, and clear
the area with grenades if you have to. Destroy all the enemy buildings you see.


Phase 3 of 5: Plenty of Room
----------------------------
Briefing: 5 Soldiers must Rescue Hostages

Your key destination is in the north end of the map, where a chopper awaits.
Take your squadron to the far east, and toss a grenade at the jeep that is
inside the next room. Blast your way into that room with a rocket, and then
move a bit to the left. Wait for the jeep to come at you in the upper left
corner, and then fire a rocket at the wall while keeping out of range. You will
see a big gun above you, so position yourself to make it kill itself. Continue
on north into the room with the chopper. Hop in and destroy everything to make
escorting the hostages an easier job. Grab the three hostages and send them to
the MASH outpost


Phase 4 of 5: Franz Klammer
---------------------------
Briefing: 6 Soldiers must Rescue Hostages

I hope your driving skills are at peak performance, because you'll be doing
some driving right through a couple of big guns. Quickly move your squad toward
the left to avoid the big gun missiles. Cross the river and get to the jeep on
the far side (keep only one man inside the jeep to preserve the other troops).
Take the jeep and jump the ramp. Now, navigate your way across no man's land.
Make sure that you always keep moving and don't crash into a big gun. Jump the
ramp at the end and retrieve the hostage there. Now, head back to the river on
the far left side and drop off the hostage.


Phase 5 of 5: The Doors
-----------------------
Briefing: 6 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Are you still having fun up to this point? I sure hope you are, because you'll
need that perverted sense of fun in order to get past this level. This level
sports two tanks and a hell of a lot of soldiers, and all you've got is a jeep.
What's worse is that if you want to preserve your soldiers, you'll have to get
to the top and bomb a door open first. If you keep them in the starting corner,
a tank may come and take all of your soldiers out.

Ready your rockets and separate your squad if you wish. Your target is the
enemy building door on the far left. To the right of this building door lies
a wall door and a barrier right next up close to it. Ready your rockets and
take your troops there. If a tank closes on your position, you will have to hop
back into the jeep and attempt to lure it away. Park the jeep in front of the
enemy building and fire away at the wall door. Fire away at the barrier, making
sure that you don't blow yourself up. Quickly head north and into the chopper.
Lay waste to everything in sight.

If you have trouble getting into the doorway with the chopper, try going into
the doorway to the right of that one. Then, you can throw grenades to clear the
area.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.19 Diablo Downstairs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 285 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 1: Look Out
----------------------
Briefing: 6 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

This map can be a bit hellbound, but just stick it out and you can succeed.
Equip your rockets and head for the north east corner. Keep your cursor ahead,
and fire at the jeep before it senses you. Send your guys into the upper right
corner. Now you have to spilt your squad up into three. Take one squad and move
them to the south west corner. Have them stand on the switch, and then take
control of another squad. Move this squad to the switch in the north west.
Finally, select the last squad and move them to the switch directly below. Once
the switch turns red, pull back a bit to avoid missile fire. When the chopper
lands, quickly enter it and destroy the big guns, then hunt down the enemy
chopper if it isn't already down. Regroup with your boys on the ground and send
the base down a few more feet under.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.20 Moors the Pity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 300 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 4: Tank Top
----------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Before you head left, destroy the building on your right side. Go on your way
and head to the far left, and then south toward a building. Keep going down
until you find the southern most enemy structure. Destroy it, then move to the
river. Quickly move into the pathway above you, but stop as soon as you are
safe from the big gun. Now, create a one-man squad (you might want to use your
lowest ranking soldier for this) and hug the left side. Move up and hold on to
the top side. Keep going right until you reach the Trooper Boosta. Savour your
newly found powers and destroy the rest of the buildings to complete the level.


Phase 2 of 4: Tanktastic
------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Send your squad inside the tank and destroy the enemy tank above you. Take out
the building close to you (second from the left side of the level) and the
building directly above that one. From that top building, head to the east and
take down the enemy tank near the barricade. Continue downwards and take the
road to the right. Fire at the approaching building and the tank near the east
side. Destroy the building in the upper right corner, then move back to the
road. Go left until you hit the crossroads. Move straight down, then drive
to the western end, where a tank lies. Waste it and the building beside it,
then destroy the building below you. Head to the river and get out of the tank.
The rest is easy: just move down the river and take out the buildings on each
side. Watch out for the sniper to the left of the river, though.


Phase 3 of 4: The Great Escape
------------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Get Civilians Home

Enter the chopper above you and head north toward a tank. Try to get the tank
to kill itself by flying closely around it. Now move toward the island in the
upper right corner and wait for the chopper to land there. Take it out, then
fly to the upper left area, where a tank awaits your command. Kill the sniper
beside the tank, then descend and take control of it.

Fire at the two barricades, then follow the path toward the cottage near the
center of the level. Take care of the big guns that you see - there are four to
destroy. Be careful that you don't destroy the cottage. The hostage should be
on his way shortly. You can continue hunting down the remaining soldiers.
Although destroying enemy buildings isn't a must, it will certainly help.


Phase 4 of 4: Whoopeee
----------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Get your rockets ready and hop into the jeep. Follow the road to the east, then
drive down to the building on the left. Get out of the jeep and cross the river
below. Move down the river edge and fire two rockets at the snipers you see
(one on each side of the river near the east edge of the map). Continue to the
south east corner and enter the chopper there. Leave a fiery trail of
destruction across the map to finish the mission.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.21 Explore My Hole
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 315 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 1: Too Many Man
--------------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

This level is straightforward, if not a bit frustrating. Avoid the mine on your
left side and just make your way to the big gun. The area around the big gun
is usually a gathering point for soldiers, so toss a grenade to clear the area
as you pass through the narrow corridor.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.22 Desert Disaster
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 330 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 4: Rocket Man
------------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Kill All Enemy, Destroy Enemy Buildings, and Rescue
Hostages

Well, you start right next to an enemy big gun and an unoccupied chopper. If
you're about to get wasted, remember to quickly restart the level. There isn't
too much to this level, really. Just fly around in your chopper and complete
the objectives. The only threatening enemy aside from the beginning is another
chopper with missiles. Don't worry about it, though - its aim isn't that great.


Phase 2 of 4: Running Out of Ideas
----------------------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Your key destination is the bottom right corner. Move down and kill the sniper.
Continue on down and once you see a crate of grenades, sweep the area for a
mine. Keep going down until you see a Troop Boosta and a big gun. Fire a rocket
at the big gun or the mines surrounding it, then grab the Troop Boosta. Now,
it's all a matter of taking down the enemy buildings and shooting the last
soldiers.


Phase 3 of 4: And They're Off
-----------------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Kill All Enemy and Protect All Civilians

You can do this the 'designed' hard way, or the easy way. First, the easy way.
Quickly break down the fence with a rocket and then fire a rocket at the moving
jeep. 

Now, the way the developers probably wanted you to complete the level: take the
jeep and just keep going until you hit the fence. Back off and throw a grenade,
and keep breaking through the fence until you reach the big gun at the end.
Target the jeep and take it down when it is in range.


Phase 4 of 4: Go For It
-----------------------
Briefing: 1 Soldier must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Another easy map, save for the starting position. Quickly enter the chopper
beside you, then destroy everything on sight.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.23 Moors Et Mortem
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 345 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 5: Sheep Shearer's Delight
-------------------------------------
Briefing: 2 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Be careful, as all enemy soldiers will now aggressively attack in every level.
Make your way to the big gun due south east of the enemy building you see. Take
down the enemy building, any soldiers in the area, and the two barricades to
the east and south. Enter the southern area and jump into the chopper you find
there. Scout out the area so that you can see where two enemy tanks lie, then
land the chopper near the empty tank in the north east. Take control of the
tank and knock down the barricade. Take care of the two tanks and any remaining
soldiers you may have missed.


Phase 2 of 5: Ireland Records
-----------------------------
Briefing: 3 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

A chopper awaits in the far lower left corner. Immediately cross over to the
left island, then toss a grenade at the sniper you see. Take care of any enemy
soldiers around you, then swim all the way to the left side of the level. Keep
on the left and swim down until you see the chopper. From here, just fly
around and blow stuff up. Remember that if an enemy chopper is able to get a
lock on with a heat-seeking missile, DON'T STOP MOVING until you have completed
the level.


Phase 3 of 5: Gawd Help Me
--------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy

Don't board the chopper, but ready your rockets as quickly as possible. To the
left and top are two enemy choppers. Destroy them while they're still on the
ground. If you fail to take them out, restart the mission.


Phase 4 of 5: Chopper Crazy
---------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

Arm your rockets and send a solitary soldier south. While keeping your cursor
down, fire at the sniper below. Regroup your soldiers if you wish, then hop
into the chopper near the sniper you killed. Land the chopper near the other
chopper you see, but try to land near the top side so that the sniper will blow
himself up as soon as you land. Take control of the other chopper, and continue
the level by destroying the enemy buildings.


Phase 5 of 5: Stop the Pidgeon
------------------------------
Briefing: 6 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy

Go down a bit and take care of the mine trap. Continue on north and fire at the
mine traps, but make sure that you don't hit the mine trap near the chopper
(which will destroy the chopper, too). Also, watch out for harpoon traps. To
avoid them, approach the island on the left side, and then move to the right
when you see the chopper. Enter the chopper carefully, then hunt down the enemy
choppers and big guns. If an enemy chopper makes it to your position before
you are in the air, restart immediately.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.24 Bomb the Base
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can have a maximum of 360 recruits at this point in the game.

Phase 1 of 6: Save that Scumbag
-------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy

There's not much to this level. All it requires is some decent tank driving
skills. Send your squad (or one soldier if you want) to the tank in the far
east. Take control of it and head to the area with the big guns. Move around in
a circle and destroy all of them. You may want to consult your map before doing
so.


Phase 2 of 6: One Man Three Choppers
------------------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

It doesn't matter which route you take, 'cause they all lead to choppers.
However, the easiest route is toward the transport chopper. Enter the path on
the right, making sure to fire over the walls and throw grenades at any
snipers you see. Get to the chopper in the bottom right corner, and then fly it
to the chopper in the upper right corner. Land safely and take control of the
chopper here. Fly around and destroy the enemy buildings to finish the level.


Phase 3 of 6: A Watery Grave
----------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy and Destroy Enemy Buildings

Head into the transport chopper and fly to the north end of the level. Fly over
the mines to make them detonate, then return to the south end and land. Send
your squad to the small island where the sniper was standing. Quickly toss
grenades at the two buildings, and then at the remaining soldiers. You must
make your shots count, as you'll only get four grenades to play with.


Phase 4 of 6: System Off
------------------------
Briefing: 4 Soldiers must Kill All Enemy, Destroy Enemy Buildings, and Destroy
Computer

There are two enemy choppers and a bunch of big guns that you will have to deal
with. Thankfully, there is an attack chopper due north of your starting
position. Send your squadron north and get into that chopper before the enemy
air force spots you. Now you have to wreck everything in sight, but only this
time you will have to dodge a fair amount of heat-seeking missiles. Even the
big guns have heat-seeking missiles here. Just keep your cool and don't rush in
too much. If you're wondering, the enemy computer is that brown spherical
structure with wires sticking out in all directions. You'll need to fire at it
a few times before it's completely destroyed.


Phase 5 of 6: Stick Em Up Cod Breath
------------------------------------
Briefing: 5 Soldiers must Kidnap Enemy Leader

Create a one-person squad if you wish, and then move down across the water. Hug
the right side of the wall as you move through the narrow hallway. Quickly
enter the jeep and make a suicide run past the big guns to the chopper.
Hopefully, you'll make it in time. There is also a tank to the south that you
can try to reach, but you have to drive down a narrow corridor with two big
guns right next to you.

With the chopper, use it to take out the big guns. Try not to let the big guns
fire at you, as they will fire heat-seeking missiles that will swat you like a
silly fly. Once all of the big guns are dealt with, eradicate the enemy forces
in the small room. Don't worry about hurting the enemy leader, as you can't.
Kidnap him and return him to the MASH outpost in the north.


Phase 6 of 6: Deathtasticelastic
--------------------------------
Briefing: 5 Soldiers must Destroy Enemy Buildings

This is it...the final level of the game. To make it interesting, you will be
unable to look at your map, and instead of the map icon being displayed, a
timer will appear in the bottom left corner. I think you should complete this
level all by yourself, but if you need the help...

Begin by immediately moving your troops into the water below. Once your squad
is in the water, create a one/two person squad and give them all the supplies.
Before you take control of that squad, though, order your main squad to move
left (watch out for the mine, though). Now take the new squad up the ladder on
the left. Break through all of the barriers with a couple of well-placed
explosives and place the squad onto the switch. The big gun on your left will
most likely kill itself when it spots this squad.

Now, make another squad and move them to the bottom end of the map. Take this
new squad up the ladder you see, but watch out for the mine trap at the very
top of the ladder. Order the squad to stand on the switch there, then take
control of your main squad.

Move the last squad into position by climbing up the ladder on the left side
of the map. Get into the big gun and dispatch the enemy artillery as fast as
you can. Move onto the switch and await the chopper. Quickly hop onto the
chopper, but don't bother regrouping. You must now seek out all the enemy
buildings. There are three on the top end of the map and one near the lower
left switch. Move quickly because the enemy air force will be gunning down your
troops. Finally, take out the enemy computer in the center of the map.
Congratulations! You've completed Cannon Fodder!



Well, I've done my part. Now it's up to you, soldier!

Would you attempt a suicidal solitary effort against a bunch of big guns rather
than try to understand my writing? Is there a question or comment you'd like to
give to me? Whip out your bazooka and launch your e-mail messages to
