Q.  What is this FAQ for?
A.  This FAQ contains a list of the names of the recruits that fight for your
side in Cannon Fodder, a game developed by Sensible Software for many
different systems including the Commodore Amiga.  This FAQ is based on the
Sega Mega Drive version, but should apply to most of the others as well.

Q.  Why did you write this FAQ?
A.  One of the most noticeable things about Cannon Fodder is that each of your
squadmembers, most of whom die horrible deaths only to be replaced by others,
have individual and non-random names.  This is a pretty neat touch as well as
one that drives home the point that war treats soldiers, each of whom are
unique beings with unique histories and families and such, like interchangeable
parts in a machine.  I wanted to see what this list of names was, as well as if
there were any Easter eggs included.  I thought some other gamers might be
interested.

Q.  How exactly did you dump the list of names?
A.  First of all, I used a nice little hex-editor called Thingy to do a
relative search in the ROM.  A relative search allows one to find a line of
text anywhere in the ROM, even if the line of text isn't encoded in ASCII (the
standard method of digitizing text); for example, I searched for the name
"Jools" which led me to the area of the ROM where the list of names could be
found.  Since this list was encoded in simple ASCII, all I had to do from there
was dump the list to a standard text file and edit it manually.  It was
actually pretty easy; Sensible did not use multiple methods of encoding the
text, nor did it use any tricks to make the ROM size smaller (which would've
made dumping the list consequently more difficult for reasons which go beyond
the scope of this document).

Q.  Is the list complete?
A.  Yes.  There are 360 recruits that show up by the end of the game, and there
are 360 names on the list.

Q.  So are there any Easter eggs in the list?
A.  Yes, there are several:

-The first five or so names are nicknames for members of Sensible Software and
the Cannon Fodder development team.  Jools programmed the game, Jops designed
the levels, Stoo did graphics, and RJ and Jops both wrote the music.  Ubik is
also a reference to a Sensible member, though I'm not entirely sure about the
next few (there were a Chris and a Pete, but I don't know about a CJ).

-The last few names are negative and insulting, since you'd have to be very
wasteful of men to get to them and your chances of beating the last mission
would be fairly low as a consequence.

-There's a pretty interesting mix of names; some of them are dead normal such
as Greg and Frank, while others like Killer and Pizza are more bizarre.

-The names do unfortunately repeat themselves on occasion.  Most notable is the
fact that Steve pops up once, then once again, then a third time almost
immediately after the second.

-Wizkid was the name of one of Sensible's other games, a sequel to their
popular Wizball game.

-There are some famous pairs and groups on the list.  These include Mario and
Luigi; Ali and Tyson; Iceman and Goose; Bono and the Edge; Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young; the crew of the starship Enterprise; and a horde of Biblical
characters.
