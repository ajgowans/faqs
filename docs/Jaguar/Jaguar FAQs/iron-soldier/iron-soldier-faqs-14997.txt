************************ INTRODUCTION/REVISIONS *************************
=========================================================================

INTRODUCTION - Iron Soldier is a fairly decent attempt at a Mech game on the
defunct Atari Jaguar console.  Although graphically it is no great shakes there
are a lot of option available to you in how you complete your missions and once
you have got to grips with the initial complex control of your Mech or Iron
Soldier there is a lot of fun to be had trashing buildings and fighting with
other Mechs in the game.  There is even a story behind all this mayhem, and
I've quoted the intro from the original manual to give you a flavour of the
game.

"DESTROY THE COPORATE MACHINE"

" Industry has taken over the planet.  Three quarters of the Earths surface is
covered with concrete and steel cities and wastelands.  The Iron Fist
Corporation (IFC) has used military force to conquer national governments and
create a world wide military dictatorship.

"Recently, the IFC developed a new weapon for use in urban areas: a 42 -foot
tall piloted robot, known as the Iron Soldier (or, IS). With such a weapon,
they will have no trouble maintaining their hold on the populous.

"However an organization has been formed to stop the IFC.  This group, known as
the Resistance, has even managed to capture and early production model of the
Iron Soldier Unit.

"This is where you come in.  As a member of the Resistance, your job is to
pilot the Iron Soldier in a one-man war against Iron Fist.  The fate of the
world rests on your shoulders, but at least your IS's shoulders can mount
rockets..."

SO that's the objective, you all alone in a prototype Mech have to kick some
evil dictator ass!   I have also used the manual to provide addition info on
the controls of the game, weapons etc.

Well I hope you enjoy my guide to this fun if flawed game!

*************************************************************************

REVISIONS - Version 1.0 (30/11/2001). First Version.  All the controls,
weapons, items and enemies listed.  Basic mission briefings provided.

Basically this first version of this guide contains mostly info drawn from the
official game manual.  This is an old game and so if you have lost your manual
or acquired it without one then this should be very helpful.  If you have the
manual then this won't be so helpful.

However, the next update will see full and detailed mission walkthroughs. As
well as tips and advice I have drawn from my own playing of the game.

Also I have discovered there are other games in this series, maybe I will
include some info on where to find the sequels and on what systems.

Version 2.0 - (30/03/2002).  Second Version.  I've provided a full walkthrough
of each level. Also a Cheats section that I acquired from the "Official Atari
Jaguar Gamers Guide" by Zach Meston and J. Douglas Arnold (1995).  This was
also helpful when I got a bit stuck on some of the later missions (doh!) Still
trying to track down the PSX Iron Soldier 3 game.  Also not having much luck
finding info on the second game in the series.  If anyone can help email me at
the usual address, any information gratefully received!

Final Version - (22/01/03) Decided to wrap this one up.  Have put in some info
on the Iron Soldier series at the end of the FAQ for those of you who actually
enjoyed this game and want to play more!  Any questions etc still welcome, but
I won't be adding any more content to this guide.

=========================================================================
****************************** 2) CONTROLS ******************************
=========================================================================

a) Controls

WALK FORWARD - A button + d-pad Up
This makes you go forward, once you have started moving, you can let go of A
and you'll carry on.

WALK BACKWARD - A button + d-pad Down
This makes you go forward, once you have started moving, you can let go of A
and you'll carry on.  You'll go slower backwards than forwards

STOPPING - Press A on its own to stop moving.  While walking you can step on
tanks, trees, houses etc.

LOOKING AROUND

d-pad up/down: Looks up and down
d-pad left/right: Looks left/right

While looking hold the C button to move your view faster.  Pressing C by itself
will centre your view.

SELECTING HAND WEAPONS

Press the Option Button to switch between the left and right hand-held weapons.
 You can also use your Iron Soldiers hands if you have no weapons equipped.

SELECTING WEAPON MOUNTS

Use the Number Pad to select the weapons assigned to each Mount.  If the weapon
is out of ammo or there is no weapon assigned to that mount then you cannot
select that mount.

1 = Right shoulder mount
3 = Left shoulder mount
4 = Right Hip mount
6 = Left Hip mount
7 = Right hand mount (or use option button)
9 = Left Hand mount (or use option button)

This is how the weapons are laid out on the number pad overlay (if you have
lost the one that came with the game the you can use this to help you make a
new one).  Left and Right are reversed on the pad because obviously you are
looking from behind the Iron Soldier, which IS a tad confusing I admit.

     * ---------------- RESET ---------------- #


b) Understanding the Game Screen

The top left corner shows a diagram of your Iron Soldier.  Highlighted parts
shows which weapon is currently in use.  The vertical bar shows how much ammo
that weapon has left.

At the top of the screen in the middle is a text bar, which tells you important
stuff like what items you have picked up.  Underneath this is a warning light
which flashes when you have taken too much damage.

In the top right of the screen is your radar.  Your Iron Soldier is in the
middle so you can see what enemies are behind you.  Ground targets appear as
white dots, airborne units show as red. Enemy Iron Soldiers are blue dots.

In the bottom left is a picture of the current weapon in use.

At the bottom of the screen is your hits/health bar that shows how much more
damage you can take before you are destroyed.

b) Choosing a Mission

There are 16 missions on the mission selection screen.  They are available in
blocks of four.  Once you have completed a mission a tick will appear.  You can
replay missions as many times as you like if you so wish.

Once you have done the first block of missions, the next block of four will be
unlocked.  You can tackle missions within each block in any order you like.
The only exception is the final block 13-16, which must be played in numerical
order.

Completing certain missions gives you access to more weapons so you may find
some missions become easier on completion of others.

One you have chosen a mission you'll be taken to the briefing screen, then if
you wish to continue select PLAY and carry on to the arming screen.  If you
wish to go back and choose a different mission select EXIT.

Destruction of your Iron Soldier means you can't complete the mission and
you'll have to use a Continue to carry on playing. If you fail the mission
outright you'll be taken back to the mission selection screen where you can
choose to do the mission again.  You do not use up a Continue for this.

=========================================================================
****************************** 3) WEAPONS *******************************
=========================================================================

a) Arming your Iron Soldier

After you have accepted a mission you will go to the Arming Screen.  Here you
can assign weapons to each of the six mounts.  Only one weapon per mount can be
assigned and various types of weapons can only be used on certain mounts.

Use the d-pad to make your selections and press B, then select the mount you
want and press B again to assign it there.  Once the Iron Soldier is armed to
your liking press EXIT to start the mission.

You have to earn better weapons as you progress through the game.  Until you
have gained them, some weapon boxes will have question marks in them.

b) Standard Manipulator

This is the technical term for you Iron Soldier's hands.  You can use you hands
as weapons, mount a chain cutter or rifle or leave one free to throw grenades.
This is the most effective way to smash buildings and damage enemy Iron
Soldiers.

c) Cassy Assault Rifle

This is a 75 MM semi-automatic hand held rifle with a good ammo storage
capacity.  Hold down the B button to make it fire 3 round bursts.   It is a
good all round close to medium range weapon, but its major downside is it needs
both hands.  You cannot equip a chain cutter if you also have the rifle
equipped.

d) Parker Chain Cutter

This is a chain driven cutting device, which replaces your right hand and must
be mounted there.  It is excellent for destroying buildings or enemy IS units
in a close range fight.

e) Badger Hand Grenade

These big grenades explode on impact and have a large area of splash damage.
If you don't strike the target directly you still may destroy it with the
explosion.  Grenades always fly a fixed distance so practice throwing them to
get the range right.  Don't get to close to the explosion as your own IS can be
damaged.  Each hip mounted grenade rack holds 8 a maximum eight grenades.

f) Rachels Gatling Gun

This is a rapid fire, 6-barrel gatling gun tat fires 40 MM rounds at over 600
rounds per minute. It's a very effective close range weapon but much less so at
longer range.  It can carry a lot of ammo and can be mounted on any shoulder or
hip mount.

g) Wolfpack Rocket Launcher

This holds 12 rockets, which are not as powerful as the grenades, but can be
fired over far greater distances.  They explode either when they hit a target
or they reach their maximum range.  They can be mounted on any shoulder or hip
mount.

h) Charlotte Rail Cannon

This uses electromagnetic pulses to fire 120 MM armour-piercing rounds at great
velocity.  It has no limit to its range, but it fires much slower than the
Gatling gun or rifle.  It is best used as a sniper weapon from behind cover.

i) Slate Heavy Shield

This is not a weapon but it increases your defence.  When you select the shield
you will only take half damage, BUT you cannot use any weapons except your feet
(for stomping on stuff).  The shield can be put on either shoulder mount.

j) Sable Cruise Missile

This is a mighty weapon that can be steered towards the target.  When fired you
will switch to missile view and can use the d-pad to steer it towards the
target.  There is an ammo bar that represents how much fuel the missile has.
If you run out of fuel before reaching the target it will explode, if not it
will explode on impact with anything you hit.

You can also detonate it at anytime by pressing B.  Only one missile can be
mounted one either shoulder, so use them wisely.


=========================================================================
****************************** 4) ENEMIES *******************************
=========================================================================

a) Glaive Helicopter

These fire bullets and rockets at you, and like to get behind you and attack
you from there.

b) Greave VTOL

These are helicopter like planes and prefer to hover above you and drop bombs
on you from above.

c) Gauntlet Attack Plane

These are fast planes that fly overhead dropping bombs on you.  However if you
complete a mission quickly you may not encounter to many as they take a while
to report to the battlefield.

d) Brassard Light Tank

These are your most common enemy, they usually fire cannon rounds, but can
attack with Rockets of you make them mad.  Stomp on them to save ammo.

e) Tasset Heavy Tank

These are very tough tanks that like to pound you with cannon shots and are
incredibly resilient.  You can't stomp on them, but get close up and use the
chain cutter to do some serious harm.

f) Javelin Rocket Launcher

This is a fixed Rocket Launcher unit.  It fires off two rockets at a time in
any directions.  Get up close and stomp on them.

g) Heaume Gun Turret

These are also fixed gun units.  They with pound you with heavy machine gun
fire if you get too close.  They are weak though and can be stomped or blown up
easily.

h) Behemoth Frigates

These are massive heavily armed and armoured frigates. You must use your most
powerful weapons like grenades or the Rail Cannon to take them out (don't waste
rockets though).  They are usually docked and can be easily targeted with
grenades, sometimes they will sail out of grenade range.  If the mission does
not require you take them out in this case, just leave them.  They will attack
you with Cannon shots and Rockets.

i) Enemy Iron Soldiers

These are generally armed with Rocket Launchers, so it's better to get in close
to attack them.  Use you fist or chain cutter to inflict serious damage, but
remember to avoid their fists!

TIPS - Gatling guns are great for picking off flying enemies at close range.
Hide behind skyscrapers and get them when the come round the corner.  VTOL's
are dangerous up close.  Shoot them with the Rail Cannon or Rifle from a safe
range.

- Use cover against Tanks or they will surround you.  Stepping on them is an
effective ammo conserving way of dealing with them.  Take them down at long
range with the Rocket Launcher and up close with the gatling gun.  Against the
Heavy Tank, avoid it until it is in close range then cut it up with the Chain
Cutter.

- You can shoot down rockets with the Gatling Gun if you aim is VERY good,
otherwise try and dodge them.  You can trace them on your radar. Take out
Rocket Launchers at a safe range with the Rail Cannon; they are very dangerous
to you if you get too close.

- Use grenades rather than Rockets to destroy ships as their side armour is
good. Wait until they are close to shore before using grenades, two should be
enough.  It can take about fifteen rockets to destroy a ship.

- Against enemy Iron Soldiers use cover and try and surprise them.  Fire
rockets at them when they are not firing at you.  Grenades work well as does
in-close fighting.  Fist or the Chain Cutter can be the best weapons against
enemy IS units.  Get a punch in then back-off to avoid a retaliatory punch,
then move back and punch again.

=========================================================================
************************ 5) BUILDINGS AND ITEMS *************************
=========================================================================

a) Factory

These buildings often contain repair crates.  They are quite sturdy.

b) Warehouse

These may have crates in them.  Some warehouses re quite sturdy, other fairly
weak.

c) Residential Block

These buildings are not too strong but rarely have any crates in them.  Most of
the population lives in buildings like these.

d) House

Rich corporate officials like to live these.  They are extremely fragile and
never contain crate.  They're fun to step on though...

e) Water Tower

These buildings are fragile structures with no crates inside.

f) Fuel tanks

These buildings are sturdy, but explode when destroyed.  The explosion will
damage nearby buildings and enemies, and may even set off other fuel tanks ion
a chain reaction!  You can be damaged by exploding fuel tanks so be careful.
If you search the wreckage you may find a repair crate.

g) Skyscrapers

These are the massive buildings were the evil corporate management works.  They
are very sturdy and not worth destroying unless its part of the mission
objective.  If you do you may occasionally find a crate in them.

h) Control Towers

These towers coordinate enemy attacks and are often placed near objectives.

i) Power Plants

These are very, VERY tough to destroy.  But they often contain useful crates.

j) WOOD crates

These contain extra Rockets, Cruise, Missiles or Grenades.  You can replenish
some of your ammo by picking up these crates.

k) STEEL crates

These contain extra ammo for the Assault Rifle, Gatling Gun, or Rail Cannon.
Pick these up if you are running low on ammo for any of these weapons.

l) REPAIR crates

These are black and yellow striped crates will repair about a quarter of the
total hit damage to your IS when you pick them up.

m) SUPPLY Crates

Some missions require you to collect supplies to aid the resistance.  Be sure
you collect any Supply crates you come across.

n) WEAPON Crates

New IS weapons are usually packed in distinctive crates.  Pick up any weapon
crates you find to equip your IS with weapons for later missions.


=========================================================================
***************** 6) MISSION BREIFINGS AND WALKTHROUGH ******************
=========================================================================

a) THE BUST

Briefing - "The Resistance wants you to destroy a local Iron Fist Warehouse
Complex.  Follow the road out of town to get there.  Grab any supplies you
find."

For this simple mission you need to destroy the brown and grey warehouses
outside the city.  Pick an assault rifle for this mission and use this
opportunity to practice steering your Iron Soldier. Walk straight ahead and
follow the road around the city until you reach a road with a handy white arrow
pointing to the right. Follow this road to a group of fuel tanks.  There's a
rifle ammo crate in one of the buildings behind the tanks and another in one of
the tanks.  Turn left at the fuel tanks and walk straight ahead to the brown
and grey warehouses.  Destroy them all and pick up the weapon crate for the
hand grenades.  There's also a spare rile ammo crate in the middle brown
warehouse.

b) CARE PACKAGE

Briefing - "Iron Fist Enterprises is using massive cargo ships to transport
I.S. Mechs.  Blow up the ships before the I.S. units can deploy."

For this mission you have to destroy two ships, I recommend you take an assault
rifle, two gatling guns and two hand grenades.  At the beginning of the
mission, turn left 45 degrees and walk towards the water.  When you see the
first ship launch grenades at it until you destroy it then turn until you can
see two skyscrapers in the distance.  The second ship is behind those buildings
so make you way over there.  Two buildings nearby have wood crates and repair
crates in them if you blow them up.  Grenade the second ship.  If you take
longer than four minutes an enemy I.S will turn up and you'll have to destroy
that as well.

c) LONDON BRIDGE

Briefing - "Iron Fist Enterprises is using bridges to transport weapons off an
island.  Destroy the centre struts of the bride with grenades to collapse
them."

This mission requires you to destroy two bridges.  You should take two gatling
guns and two hand grenades.  From the start turn left then right to check out
your objectives.  There are plenty of various crates in the buildings near
where you start as well if you need supplies. Attack the left bridge first. 
Walk towards it and then turn either side of the ramp until you are at the
waterline.  Aim at the bridge and you'll need at least five grenades to destroy
it. It will collapse when destroyed.  Now turn and head to the second bridge
and destroy it in the same way.  In the fuel tanks nearby are repair crates and
spare grenades are to be found in the orange warehouses.  On completion of this
mission you'll earn the Chain Cutter weapon.

d) MIDNIGHT RAID

Briefing - "A midnight raid on an enemy supply dump will give the Resistance
supplies that are badly needed.  Four guard towers and several tanks watch the
dump.  Keep a lookout for new weapons too."

For this mission you have to destroy a group of warehouses surrounded by four
security towers.  So tool yourself up with your newly acquired chain cutter, 2
gatling guns and two hand grenades.  Walk straight ahead towards the city
destroying all enemies in your path.  Before you reach the city turn and go to
the left.  When you reach the last two skyscrapers look for the security
towers, the warehouses are there. As you close in, lob grenades into the
warehouse area and you'll destroy most of them as well as the tanks lurking by
them.  Go in and finish them off and collect ALL the supply crates and the
weapon crate with the gatling gun inside.

e) HUNT THE HUNTER

Briefing - "AN enemy Mech is terrorising a pro-Resistance town.  It is armed
with rockets.  You must find a way to protect yourself from the rockets and
destroy him quickly."

Now it's time to go one-on-one with an enemy I.S.  So arm yourself with the
chain cutter, grenades and gatling gun.  The best tactic is to walk straight
towards the I.S. and lob the grenades at it. If you are skilful you can destroy
it this way.  If that fails close in on it and hack it up with the chain
cutter.  It will fire rockets at you, so shoot them down with the gatling gun. 
Up close it will throw punches at you, dodge these by backing off as it turns
to face you.  Then lunge back at it with the chain cutter as it recovers from
throwing the punch.  When it's destroyed you will now have the Rocket launcher
available to you

f) WALK IN THE PARK

Briefing - "The Resistance headquarters has come under attack by a battalion of
enemy tanks!  Destroy all the tanks before they destroy the Resistance.  Watch
out for other forces that may be providing cover fire for the tanks."

Stomping time!  In this mission you have to destroy every tank on the level.
Suit up and arm yourself with the Chain Cutter, Gatling Gun, Rail Cannon and 2
Rocket Launchers.  You'll see two small tanks at the start, so step on them. 
Follow the road round to the right and you will see the heavy tank.  Walk up
close to it and look down, now use your chain cutter to hack it up. When that's
done with, head to the Resistance HQ and stamp on all the tanks surrounding the
place.  Also shoot down all the helicopters with gatling guns and rocket
launchers.  Use your I.S to draw the enemy fire away from the HQ. If you still
haven't finished the mission you need to mop up any remaining tanks.  Repair
and ammo crates can be found in the grey warehouses next to the HQ.

g) FOX AND HOUND

Briefing - "Rebel agents have discovered that a new Iron Fist weapon is being
transported through the city in several trucks.  Find and destroy all of the
trucks and capture the gun and any supplies you find."

The objective here is to destroy three convoys of trucks and take the Rail
Cannon from them.  As the mission begins, turn left until you see the first
convoy.  Walk over and stamp all over it or fire rockets at them.  Now follow
the convoy route to reach a group of factories, warehouses and oil tanks.  If
you wait around at the entrance after 90 seconds of mission time have elapsed
the convoy will appear and you can smash them up.  When that's done walk over
to the large grassy area and look for a group of skyscrapers.  Walk to the left
side to find the third and final truck convoy.  Blow it up and collect the Rail
Cannon.

h) PEARL HARBOUR

Briefing - "Four Iron Fist Cargo Ships are currently docked at a lightly
guarded ship yard.  Destroy all four before they can escape."

Now you must destroy four ships docked around an island.  Take with you a
gatling gun, hand grenades, rail cannon and rocket launcher.  There are repair
crates located in the dark red skyscrapers in this mission if you need a boost.
 Head away from the shore towards the closest red skyscraper, then turn left
and go through town until you see a second red skyscraper with a blue trim. 
Behind that is the first ship, so destroy it.  Now turn around and go back to
the shoreline.  Go left and look for a long peninsula with brown warehouses. 
Wait around on the peninsula until two ships sail past you. Destroy them and
leave the peninsula and the go back to where you began the mission.  The last
ship will sail past this location.  Let fly with the rail cannon and rockets to
destroy it.

i) PANDORA'S BOX

Briefing - "The IFC has turned one of their research centres into a fortress.
Get inside the Fortress and find out what they are building."

Its time to infiltrate the enemy fortress and grab yourself the Heavy Shield. 
Load up with the chain cutter, gatling gun, hand grenades, rocket launcher and
rail cannon.  You can find crates inside most of the buildings in front of the
fortress.  Go to the right side of the fortress and wipe out the gun turrets,
rocket launchers and tanks. Target the two turrets on the towers and take them
out as well.  Now you need to take out the enemy I.S so head round the front of
the fortress and throw grenade at he front right corner.  When the I.S. appears
throw more grenades to destroy it, get up close with the chain cutter if you
need to.  Now bash down one of the doors with your chain cutter and go inside. 
Wipe out all the buildings and collect the Heavy Shield.

j) HORNETS NEST

Briefing - "Iron Fist helicopters are plaguing Resistance forces across the
city.  Find and destroy their airfield and eliminate and helicopters you see"

For this you must destroy an enemy airfield and the helicopters stationed
there.  Arm yourself with a chain cutter, gatling gun, rail cannon and two
rocket launchers. Turn 45 degrees to the right and walk straight ahead.  Go
through a group of skyscrapers, a small field an apartment complex and finally
you'll get to the airfield.  During this little hike use you chain cutter to
destroy skyscrapers and the rail cannon to snipe the helicopters and tanks at
long range.  When you reach the airfield you'll see a group of four helicopters
and a VTOL.  Destroy these quickly then turn at the hangers and fill them full
of rockets.  Once the helicopters and hangars are eliminated turn towards the
tower at the corner at the corner of the airfield and destroy it to complete
the missions.

k) ONE-MAN ARMY

Briefing - "The IFC has constructed a tank factory on the outskirts of a desert
town.  Watch for the power plant and destroy all the nearby buildings to stop
tank production."

Time to destroy a power plant and factory.  Tool up with your trusty chain
cutter, gatling gun, hand grenades and rocket launcher.  You need at least two
racks of rockets to destroy most of the skyscrapers and warehouses.  Follow the
grey road and make a right at the fork.  Once you turn right all the buildings
you see on the dark red bit of land must be flattened.  Fire rockets at the
cluster of fuel tanks to the left then turn right when you get to the
skyscrapers.  Destroy the rocket launchers.  Turn left and walk to the brown
warehouses.  Throw a grenade into the middle of the orange buildings and
destroy the tanks with rockets.  A heavy tank might show up, either hide behind
the skyscrapers until it shoves off or chain cutter it to pieces. Two large
maroon skyscrapers surround the power plant.  Destroy every building in that
area and you're done.  If you are short on ammo go back up the road and take
the left fork to find buildings with ammo crates in them.

l) THE BEST DEFENCE

Briefing - "A Resistance laboratory is trying to develop a long-range missile.
Iron Fist is sending forces to destroy the lab, however.  Protect the lab at
all costs!"

Another fight with an enemy I.S. is on the cards here, plus you must defend the
lab.  Get your chain cutter, gatling gun, rail cannon and rocket launcher out. 
As the mission begins the lab is being attacked by helicopters, so get to the
lab and shoot them all down.  Stay by the lab for about three or four minutes
and take done the choppers before going to fight the enemy I.S.  Next take out
the heavy tank as it will destroy the lab otherwise.  Then finally go find the
I.S. lurking around some apartment buildings at the edge of the level in the
opposite direction from where the helicopters are coming from.  Take it down,
there's lots of ammo and repair crates in the buildings around the lab.

m) URBAN RENEWAL

Briefing - "Resistance spies have found out that Iron Fist is making a nuclear
bomb somewhere in their southern Industrial Complex.  No one knows what
building it is in, so your job is to level the place - leave no building
standing!"

Time for more mayhem!  Destroy every building in the area, which includes the
water towers and buildings on the three islands. Get you chain cutter, gatling
gun, hand grenades and two rocket launchers.  Destroy the buildings on the
islands first with your rockets.  Try and steer clear of the enemy I.S which is
in the area.  The enemy VTOL's will help you a lot as their bombs will destroy
a lot of the buildings for you.  As most of the buildings have crates in them
you can rampage round destroying everything without to much fear of running low
on anything.

n) ESCORT SERVICE

Briefing - "Resistance refugees need to be evacuated from a deadly fighting
ground and taken safely out of the city.  You must protect the trucks that are
transporting them.  Stop any enemies that could hurt the convoy of trucks!"

Now you have to protect three trucks.  Arm yourself with a rail cannon and
rocket launchers.  First off you'll probably need a couple of tries just to
learn the route and where the enemies will attack you. The first heavy tank
will attack you, the second one will concentrate on the trucks. Use the rail
cannon to take out helicopters, rocket launchers and VTOLs.  Stay in front of
the trucks and destroy the enemies before they can target the trucks.  The
trucks are very weak and can be destroyed in two shots from a heavy tank.  A
good tactic is to walk round the city clockwise taking out the worst enemies
and meeting the trucks in the middle of town.

o) RETURN TO SENDER

Briefing - "Iron Fist is blockading a Resistance port with a fleet of warships,
cutting off valuable medical supplies.  Destroy the warships so the Resistance
fleet dock."

There are five ships to destroy on this mission so its time to break out the
big weapons.  Take two cruise missiles, a gatling gun and hand grenades.  Turn
right and walk towards the two helicopters. Pound them and any tanks with your
gatling gun.  Now stand on the tip of the peninsula you are on.  Destroy the
first ship with grenades.  Turn around and blow up the fuel tanks to get repair
crates.  Launch a cruise missile and steer it towards the opposite side of the
city and destroy the docked ship.  Now walk past the brown warehouses on the
peninsula to the ship nearby.  Destroy it with grenades.  A nearby warehouse as
another cruise missile inside it.  Get that and use the two missiles to destroy
the last two ships.

p) WAR IS HECK

Briefing - "The Resistance forces have broken through to the Iron Fist core
territories.  Now you must destroy the Iron Fist Command Centre.  Take out all
skyscrapers.  Watch out for enemies.  Good luck!  You will need it..."

The last battle, destroy all the skyscrapers, the enemy HQ and the enemy I.S.
inside.  Get yourself a chain cutter, gatling gun, heavy shield, rail cannon
and rocket launcher.  This can be a long mission, but there are plenty of ammo
and repair crates scattered about.  Use them wisely though.  If the mission
carries on to long some of the destroyed gun turrets will respawn.  Take out
the closet skyscrapers first and then walk over to the warehouse area.  Avoid
the enemy packed middle area, circle around destroying the skyscrapers as you
go.  Now head down town and stay around the edge of the level to avoid getting
surrounded.  Make a beeline for the enemy HQ and carve it up with you chain
cutter, don't stop attacking it expect to fend off helicopters.  When the
building is destroyed the enemy I.S will come out.  Take it on in hand-to-hand
combat and make use of the shield.  Once the I.S is destroyed its all over! 
You win, hooray!!!

********************* 8) THE IRON SOLDIER SERIES ************************
=========================================================================

This FAQ covers the first game in the series and was released in 1994 by Atari
for the Atari Jaguar Console.  It is actually still quite easy to find on eBay
and other such places.  I picked up my copy in mint unopened boxed condition.

The first sequel was Iron Soldier 2 and is harder to track down.  It was
released on the even more ill-fated Atari Jaguar CD add-on. It was also made by
Atari.  Unfortunately I have not been able to play this incarnation of it.

Iron Soldier 3 was released in 2000 USA and 2001 UK/EU on the Sony PlayStation
(the Jaguar now long defunct). Atari at this point were also defunct, so the
company Telegames had produced this one.

It's a good game, nothing amazing, but beats the Psone Mech Warrior games and
stays true mostly to the feel of the original game, with the emphasis on
mission based destruction of enemy towns and bases.

The future?  Now Mech games are becoming more prolific, I think the superior
nature of most current 128bit titles will probably mean the basic "smash
n'burn" style game play of Iron Soldier will not find favour.  Which is a
shame, it would be nice to play some all out mech destruction without having to
worry to much about overly complex weapon and armour arrangements.. We shall
just have to see.
