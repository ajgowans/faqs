I.     Introduction

This is a FAQ/Walkthrough for the Jaguar CD game Iron Soldier 2.  It contains a
list of controls, a complete walkthrough, and a mini-review.

*******************************************************************************
II.    Background Story

Here is the background story from the instruction booklet:

"The War Continues!

After Iron Fist Corporation was destroyed, the Resistance set up a democratic
government called the United Republic.

However, now that Iron Fist is gone, the rival corporation, known as PENTA, is
trying to take over IFC's old territory by raiding and terrorizing the United
Republic.

This time, you are part of the UR's elite defense force.  Your job is to pilot
an Iron Soldier and use it to eliminate the terrorist forces and protect the UR
from military harm."

*******************************************************************************
III.   Getting Started

You can press B to skip the opening intro.  On the Title Screen are three
choices:

START GAME

Begin a new game at the current difficulty level (default is Medium).

LOAD GAME

Load a previously saved game.  Press the corresponding save slot number on the
numpad to load.

OPTIONS

Here you can change the difficulty level, invert the joypad for the IS and
Cruise Missile, swap the A and B Buttons, and change the sound mode.  Please
note that "Normal" for Aiming is Up moves up and Down moves down while Normal
for Cruise Missile means Up moves down and Down moves up!

*******************************************************************************
IV.    Basic Gameplay

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Controls

Joypad Up/Down            Look Up/Down
Joypad Left/Right         Move Left/Right
A Button + Up             Increase Speed
A Button + Down           Decrease Speed/Reverse
B Button                  Fire Current Weapon
C Button + Joypad         Turn Faster
A + C + Joypad            Turn Even Faster
Option                    Switch Weapon
Pause                     Pause Game
Numpad 1                  Select Right Shoulder Mount
Numpad 2                  Advanced Controls (Joypad turns turret, Joypad + C
                          turns entire Iron Soldier)
Numpad 3                  Select Left Shoulder Mount
Numpad 4                  Select Right Hip Mount
Numpad 6                  Select Left Hip Mount
Numpad 7                  Select Right Hand
Numpad 8                  Display Mission Stats
Numpad 9                  Select Left Hand
Numpad * + #              Reset

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Arming Screen

This can be a little confusing (or at least it was for me at first).  Your
Iron Soldier has a total of six mounts that can hold weapons.  Each weapon has
two restrictions: it can only be mounted on certain mounts and there is a
maximum number of each weapon you are allowed to carry (see Weapons section for
details).

Use the Joypad to select a weapon and display its stats.  To mount it press B.
If there is an available mount for that weapon it will flash.  You can use the
Joypad to cycle through all available mounts.  When you are ready to place a
weapon press B.

To remove a weapon, you do NOT select it on the left!  Instead you press C then
use the Joypad to choose the MOUNT you want to remove.  Press B to remove or
C to cancel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  HUD

On the left side of the screen is a bar representing the ammo remaining for the
selected weapon.  Your radar and speed are displayed on the right.  In the
center is your targeting reticule and the bottom your health meter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Basic Gameplay

The game is divided into 20 missions split into four groups.  Except for the
last group, you can play a group's missions in any order.  Before each mission
you will be given a briefing explaining (usually badly) what your goal is.

Gameplay consists of you walking around shooting things.  You have a radar on
your HUD that shows nearby enemies but no compass or level map.  EVERYTHING you
see is destructible: enemies, buildings, even friendly units.  Be careful, some
buildings, such as fuel tanks, will explode when destroyed and these explosions
can damage your Iron Soldier.  

If you fail a mission (i.e. allowed something you were supposed to protect to
be destroyed) then you will be taken to the Mission Fail screen where you will
be berated.  If your energy reaches zero, your Iron Soldier will be destroyed
and you will be punished by having to watch the death cinematic (CANNOT be
skipped!) then asked if you want to continue (you have unlimited continues).
Either way you'll end up at the Mission Select Screen again.

When you successfully complete a mission, you'll be shown a victory briefing,
then be given a chance to save your game to the Memory Track.  Press the
save slot number you want to use on your Numpad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Basic Strategies

-  Watch your radar carefully.  Aerial units will usually head right towards
   you.

-  Use your Chainsaw or Manipulator when knocking down buildings to conserve
   ammo.

-  If you are having trouble remembering the numpad mapping, it helps to think
   of it as looking at an Iron Soldier:  2 is the head, 1 and 3 the shoulders,
   4 and 6 the hips, and 7 and 9 the feet.  Or you can always use an Iron
   Soldier 1 overlay...

-  Repair Crates are most often found in fuel tanks while Ammo Crates are
   usually found inside of warehouses.

-  You can play the missions in groups 1-3 in any order.  If you are having
   trouble with a particular mission (especially in the first two groups), then
   skip it and come back later with better weapons.

-  Try beating the first ten missions in this order for optimal equipment:
   1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 7, 8, 9

V.     Walkthrough

Note:  This walkthrough was written while playing the EASY difficulty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Mission 1:  Plant Closure

 =========================================================================
|                          RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT                          |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Shoulder:  Empty             | Left Shoulder:  Empty              |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hip:       Grenades          | Left Hip:       Grenades           |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hand:      Assault Rifle     | Left Hand:      Manipulator        |
 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Terrorists are using abandoned factories outside of town to build a new high
speed walker.

Destroy the main industrial installations in the desert.

TIPS:

The first mission is an easy warm-up to get your feet wet.  The hardest part of
this mission is actually figuring out what you need to destroy.  

Take a good look at the rotating map on the mission briefing screen.  You'll
see a circular road leading from the city to three rectangular lots and back
to the city.  Your goal is to level ALL structures in those three lots.  When
you destroy a building housing an enemy walker it'll dash off, just ignore it.

Turn left and follow the road left to the first lot.  Use your Grenades on the
fuel tanks, then switch to your Manipulator to destroy the rest of the
buildings.  Be sure to grab the striped crates, these will repair damage to
your Iron Soldier.

Now follow the road to the second lot and flatten it using the same strategy
as before.  You'll find more Repair Crates here as well brown ones that will
replenish your Rifle Ammo and Grenades.

Keep moving to the third lot and raze the structures here.  You'll find a
star crate, this contains the Rachels Gatling Gun which will now be available 
for future missions.  A few seconds after clearing the final lot the mission
will end and you'll be taken to the debriefing screen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Mission 2:  Rat Trap

 =========================================================================
|                          RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT                          |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Shoulder:  Gatling Gun       | Left Shoulder:  Gatling Gun        |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hip:       Grenades          | Left Hip:       Grenades           |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hand:      Assault Rifle     | Left Hand:      Manipulator        |
 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Spies have found warehouses used by PENTA terrorists to hide illegal weapons.
They are located on an small isle and defended by enemy troops.  Destroy all
buildings on this isle and try to capture the weapons stored there.

TIPS:

Time for a "real" mission!  During this mission you will have to deal with
Gantlets, V.T.O.L.s. and even an enemy Iron Soldier!  The V.T.O.L.s are
the biggest threat, destroy them as soon as you see them.

As soon as the mission starts, a Gantlet will make a bombing run, destroying
the building in front of you.  Move forward towards the water then follow it
left.  When you see the bridge, DON'T cross, keep following the water left.

There are two Repair Crates inside the fuel tanks.  Immediately past them is
an enemy I.S., quickly dispatch it with Grenades.  If you run out, use your
Assault Rifle.

Keep going till you cross the bridge to the small island.  Level EVERYTHING
here.  Each group of fuel tanks holds two Repair Crates each.  The four
blue warehouses contain the Supply Crates you're after.  Successful completion
of this mission will earn you the use of Sable Cruise Missiles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Mission 3:  Supply Run

 =========================================================================
|                          RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT                          |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Shoulder:  Gatling Gun       | Left Shoulder:  Gatling Gun        |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hip:       Grenades          | Left Hip:       Grenades           |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hand:      Assault Rifle     | Left Hand:      Manipulator        |
 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA troops are massing in a small city.  Raid their camp and destroy the
warehouses on the island to capture their supplies.

TIPS:

There are five groups of warehouses, each group holds two supply crates so
all we need to do is collect 10 crates and we're done.  Easy right?

What makes this mission so challenging is the dearth of repair crates, the only
two I've found are inside the factories to the right of the mission start.  The
key to success here is to work fast and avoid taking damage as much as
possible.  Glaives are the biggest threat, watch your radar carefully and take
them out with the Gatling Gun.

Once again we'll start out by heading left towards the gold warehouses.  Raze
them using Grenades.  Inside will be two Supply Crates, Assault Rifle Ammo, and
Grenades.  Continue towards the left.  As you approach the brown warehouses,
use your Assault Rifle on the Glaive that is taking off, then use it to destroy
the first warehouse, then use your Gatling Gun on the remaining buildings.
There's no Supply Crates here, but you will find valuable ammo.

Continue your trek towards the left.  A building will explode and an enemy
I.S. will appear, quickly take it out with Grenades.  Once he's taken care of,
look RIGHT, you'll see four blue warehouses containing two Supply Crates and
Ammo.

Now comes the toughest part.  Keep heading left and you'll encounter a group
of blue warehouses, then a brown group, and one final blue group.  Each group 
contains two Supply Crates.  By the time you reach that last group, you'll 
probably be on life support, so use your remaining Grenades to level them fast
and grab the crates to complete the mission.  Your reward will be the Sherry 00
Gauge Shotgun.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Mission 4:  Field of Fire

 =========================================================================
|                          RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT                          |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Shoulder:  Cruise Missile    | Left Shoulder:  Cruise Missile     |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hip:       Grenades          | Left Hip:       Grenades           |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hand:      Shotgun           | Left Hand:      Manipulator        |
 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA has launched a surprise attack on the UR.  Protect the main skyscrapers
against the enemy forces and destroy all SATYR Walkers.

TIPS:

The skyscrapers you have to defend are the two red buildings and the three
blue towers with pyramid tops.  In order to complete the mission, you have to
destroy all three SATYRs before those five buildings are destroyed.  The 
Glaives, SATYRs, and V.T.O.L will attack the buildings while the Brassards and
Basilisks concentrate on your Iron Soldier.  If you need them, the warehouses
near the red buildings contain a couple of Repair Crates.

Walk towards the red buildings, taking out any tanks and choppers you encounter
with your Shotgun (one shot at close range will do).  Once you are past the
second red building, look left and off a ways you'll see the lone blue tower.
The first walker will approach from this direction.  Fire off a Cruise Missile
and take him out.

Do a 180 and head towards the twin blue towers.  To their left is a V.T.O.L.
on the ground.  Head over and take it out with your Shotgun before it launches.

Now head back towards the red buildings.  The second walker will approach from
this direction, quickly dispatch it using your grenades.

The final walker will approach from the direction of the twin towers.  Head
over there and wait for him to appear.  As soon as you see him take him out
with your remaining Cruise Missile.  Once he's down, you'll complete the
mission and be rewarded with the Heavy Shield.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Mission 5:  Road Block

 =========================================================================
|                          RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT                          |
|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|

|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hand:      Shotgun           | Left Hand:      Manipulator        |
 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Criminals are hijacking our transport trucks by blocking off their travel
routes.  Clear the routes and protect the trucks from harm until they can
make it out of the city.

TIPS:

You start the mission with two transport trucks, a third will join your convoy
a short time later.  At least one of your trucks must make it to the end in
order to successfully complete the mission.  Even though I carried a full 
weapons load into this mission, I ended up only using the Gatling Gun.

In this mission, with the exception of the V.T.O.L, only the GROUND units will
attack your trucks.  It's vital to take out the roadblocks, the trucks will
run right into them and blow themselves up.  You can destroy roadblocks with
either your weapons or your feet.  Also, please note that you can destroy the
trucks by accidently shooting or stepping on them so be careful!

The trick to this mission is that instead of sticking close to the convoy, you
should run ahead and take out any roadblocks and ground troops.  There are 
really only two other things to look out for:  After passing between the twin 
blue towers, you'll see a V.T.O.L. take off, destroy it quickly.  The other is
the ROC transport plane, it'll drop off multiple Basilisks by parachute.  Take
them out with your Gatling Gun while they are floating down.

It really comes down to trial and error, once you learn the ambush sites it
shouldn't be too difficult.  Your reward for a successful mission is the
Charlotte Rail Cannon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  Mission 6:  Bomb Squad

 =========================================================================
|                          RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT                          |

|------------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| Right Hand:      Shotgun           | Left Hand:      Manipulator        |
 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Industrial terrorists have placed car bombs throughout the city.  Destroy these
cars before too many of the bombs can go off.

TIPS:

Let me break down the numbers for you:  there are 12 bombs and if four blow up
you fail the mission, so that means to win you must destroy at least nine.
The "car" bombs are the red vans.  Some are en route to their targets, others
have already arrived.  A message will appear whenever a bomb goes off.  Proper
use of the Shield is key to surviving long enough to complete the mission.

As soon as the mission starts head forward down the street.  Turn right at the
turn.  Remember those brown warehouses on the left, we'll be coming back soon.
You'll see a van, destroy it then continue forward to the one behind it.  When
that one's destroyed, do a hard right.  You'll catch a glimpse of a van rolling
down the street.  

Once you blast it do a 180 and head back towards those brown warehouses.  As
you approach use your Gatling Gun to destroy the warehouse on the far right to
reveal a van.  Stomp it then turn around and hang a right down the street,
another van will be heading towards you.  

After you've taken him out, hang a left and head towards the factory.  Blast it
as you're walking to reveal a much needed Repair Crate.  Then bear slightly to
your right towards the twin factories, inside those are two more Repair Crates.
By now a ROC will have dropped off a group of Basilisks so you'll be taking a
lot of damage.

Head past the field of fuel tanks.  There are two vans parked among the
buildings.  After they're toast, turn left and you should see a van going down
the street.  Take it out and continue down the street along the edge of the
city.  Off in the distance you'll see another van, take it out with your Rail
Gun.  Continue forward and take out the final van.  The WolfPack Rocket
Launcher will now be available for use.

G.  Mission 7:  Duck Hunt

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA troops are attacking the UR's main harbor.  Locate and destroy all
enemy ships before the enemy can cause greater damage to the city.

TIPS:

This is actually a pretty easy mission!  All you have to do is destroy all five
ships before all buildings are destroyed.  Your targets are stationary and 
there are plenty of Ammo and Repair Crates lying around.  It takes 18 rockets
or 21 rail blasts to sink a ship.  This mission is actually even easier if you
have beaten Mission 10 and have earned the Grenade Launcher!

Start by turning right and destroying the ship in the distance using your Rail
Gun.  Then proceed towards your left and take out the ship with your Rocket
Launcher (pump that B button hard!).

Clear the factories and warehouses on your right with the Shotgun.  Grab the
crates then proceed to the next ship.  Take it out using your Rocket Launcher,
if you run out of rockets, switch to the Shotgun.

Continue on, clearing out the warehouses as you go.  Take out the next ship
using Rockets.  Keep moving until you see the final ship, take it out with your
Rail Gun to finish the mission.  You'll be rewarded with the Ferret Homing
Missiles.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

An illegal PENTA military airbase has been discovered within striking range of
UR territory.  Destroy the airbase before they launch all of the attack planes.

TIPS:

Your mission is to destroy all five jets as well every building on the
airfield.  Once they get in the air, the only weapon you have that can bring
them down will be your Homing Missiles so don't waste them!

Turn slightly to the right and head towards the yellow tank.  Walk between
the tanks and take out the gun turret, V.T.O.L., and tank using your Gatling 
Gun.  

Keep heading straight towards the airfield.  As soon as you see the red tower,
launch four rockets to destroy it, then use a rocket to blow up the yellow
fuel tanks, there are two critical Repair Crates inside.

Past the tanks is a Tasset Heavy Tank, quickly use your rockets to destroy it
then use your Gatling Gun to take out the Basilisk.

Use your Shotgun to take out the four Wyverns on the ground, then head back
to the Repair Crates.  Collect them and take out any ground forces you see.
Use your Homing Missiles to take out the Wyvern in the sky.  Quickly use your
remaining Rockets and Shotgun to level the buildings before several SATYRS
appear.  Your reward for completing this mission is the Carlisle 75 MM Heavy 
Machine Gun.

I.  Mission 9:  Fill 'er Up

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Enemy agents are sabotaging our transports.  Protect the truck convoy from
enemy fire.  At least two trucks have to reach their destination to complete
this mission.

TIPS:

This mission is like a harder version of Road Block (yippee).  Unlike in
Road Block, it's critical to stay near your convoy to protect it from aerial
attacks.

There are three "traps" to watch out for.  The first is at the very beginning,
after you see the first helicopter take off, if you look right you'll see a
V.T.O.L.  You need to destroy it quickly, it can take out your whole convoy in
a single pass!  The second is the SATYR that appears when you reach the city.
Quickly dispatch it using Rockets.  The final ambush is in the form of a bomber
that appears near the end of the stage.  You want to save a couple of Homing
Missiles for this part so you can quickly take care of him.

Other than these, it's basically a matter of sticking close to your convoy and
taking out threats as they appear with your Heavy Machinegun.  There are plenty
of Ammo and Repair Crates inside the warehouses if needed.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA backed terrorists are driven bomb-laden trucks through the city.  Stop
the trucks before they can destroy their targets.

TIPS:

This mission is like an EASY version of Bomb Squad.  In order to win, you must
destroy ALL ten trucks before they explode.  Fortunately the trucks are en
route to their targets.  The trucks are yellow with red skull and crossbones
on them so they're easy to spot.  You can take them out at a distance with two
Rockets.

Start by turning left them walking forward.  You should see a truck through
the gaps between buildings.  After you take him out, do a 180 and head back to
where you started.  A couple more trucks will enter the area.  From this point
on it's just a matter of patrolling the city and taking out the remaining
trucks.  Your biggest concern is actually the Choppers and V.T.O.L.s that will
gang up on you, but they're nothing a Homing Missile can't fix...

Once you've completed this mission you'll unlock the game's final weapon: the
awesome Corinne Automatic Grenade Launcher.

K.  Mission 11:  Acid Rain

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA troops are trying to capture a major industrial center by air drop.  Stop
this attack by destroying all their ground forces.

TIPS:

If only they were all this easy!  The mission briefing for once is pretty 
self explanatory, all you need to do to win is destroy all enemy ground forces.
Since the enemy is trying to capture and not destroy the city, you can take 
your time.

Start out by walking forward and heading slightly to the left.  You should
pop out in a field that contains a lot of yellow and grey fuel tanks.  When you
arrive, enemies will already be parachuting down, take them out with your
Heavy Machinegun before they land.  On the far side of the field is a SATYR,
quickly destroy it with Rockets then clear out the area.

This field is your "safe zone".  The strategy is to stay here and pick off
enemies as they appear.  Watch the ROCs, once they start dropping off troops
take them out with your Rail Gun before they land.  The fuel tanks contain
Repair Crates if you get low on health.  Once the ROCs are done, a couple of
Gantlets will appear, take them down with Homing Missiles.

Once your radar is clear, it's time to move to the other side of the city and
mop up.  Use your radar to track down and eliminate the remaining ground enemy
forces.  There is one more SATYR to deal with, but other than that it should
be an easy task.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

An automated defense system has gone berserk.  Shut it down by destroying the
four power plants delivering its energy.

TIPS:

The first thing you'll notice is that this is a night mission so spotting
enemies will be difficult.  The main threats here are the towers, take them out
with three Rockets as soon as you see them.  There are also a couple of SATYRs
running around.  Study the map before the mission begins to get a feel of
where the power plants are located.  There's plenty of ammo hidden inside of
the factories and warehouses.

Turn slightly to the right and you'll see the first power plant off in the
distance, head towards it.  As you approach, you'll see a tower on the right,
take it out with Rockets.  Destroy the dome using your Grenade Launcher, the
power plants are very sturdy and will take a lot of Grenades so pump that B
button!

Once the dome is destroyed follow the road to the next target.  Destroy it like
before.  Next to the dome is a skyscraper that is hiding a Repair Crate.  Head
past the factories to the third dome.  A warehouse next to this one contains a
Repair Crate.  Continue on to the final dome and quickly raze it with your
Grenades.  Once the dome stops exploding your mission will be complete.

M.  Mission 13:  Air Patrol

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Destroy all the warehouses in the city and collect the supplies found there.
But be warned: PENTA has called in an air strike against your Iron Soldier.

TIPS:

Another mission briefing hit by the ambiguity gremlin.  The goal is to collect
all 13 Supply Crates.  The crates can be found in both warehouses AND
factories.  The mission ends once you collect the thirteenth Supply Crate, even
if you haven't destroyed all the buildings.

Once you know where you're supposed to look, this mission is actually really
easy!  Just turn left and make a circuit around the island, destroying any
warehouses and factories you see.  You can stay on the beach, there are no
crates inside the city itself.  Use your Grenade Launcher to raze the buildings
quicker, two Grenades will do the trick.  There are plenty of Repair Crates
hidden inside the fuel tanks if you get low on energy.  Enemy resistance is 
light, use your Heavy Machinegun and Homing Missiles on the aerial units and 
your Grenade Launcher on the pair of SATYRs patrolling the island.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Terrorists have taken control of two Iron Soldier units on the outskirts of the
UR.  Destroy the two units before they begin damaging buildings inside UR
territory.

TIPS:

One of the toughest missions so far, enemy Iron Soldiers can withstand a TON of
punishment!  Fortunately they appear one out a time so you don't have to worry
about them ganging up on you.  You can intercept them well before they enter
the city so really all you have to worry about is surviving.

When you start the mission, equip your Homing Missiles and start walking
forward.  Quickly take out the SATYR then switch to your Gatling Gun to take
out the Basilisk.  Keep walking, the second yellow fuel tank contains a Repair
Crate.

Eventually the first Iron Soldier will appear.  Switch to Grenades and lob all
eight at him once you're in range.  Then switch to your Chainsaw and go up 
close for the kill.  He won't fire Rockets while your close but he will punch,
and those punches do a lot of damage.  Repeat this pattern: hit him with the
Chainsaw and when he turns towards you quickly put it into reverse.  When he
turns away, go back in and hit him again.  

Once he's destroyed, replenish your health and ammo by leveling warehouses,
factories, and fuel tanks.  Several Wyverns will appear; take them out with
your remaining Homing Missiles.  Eventually the second enemy I.S. will appear
near where you fought the first one.  Take him down using the same tactics.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA has build (sic) a military base dangerously close to United Republic
territory.  Don't leave a single building standing!

TIPS:

Looks like the ambiguity gremlin took the night off.  The briefing says it all,
raze every single building to the ground!  No special strategies here: clear
the immediate vicinity of enemies, demolish the fuel tanks with the Grenade
Launcher and the other buildings with your Chainsaw.  Rinse, lather, repeat.

I prefer to take out the surrounding areas first then the city itself, but it
really doesn't matter.  There are swarms of aerial enemies, take them out with
your Gatling Gun and Homing Missiles.  There are also a lot of SATYRs running
amok, your Grenade Launcher is best for them.  Don't worry too much about
conserving ammo, there are tons of crates to be found.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Find and destroy all enemy ships before they can escape.  A newly developed
ground transport system will help you.

TIPS:

Pretty straightforward, you just need to destroy all six ships to complete the
mission.  There are tons of enemies around making survival difficult, so 
proceed with caution.  The "transport system" is basically a disc on the ground
that teleports you when you step on it.  Unfortunately, it's a one-way trip, so
make sure you're done with your current island before moving on.

The first ship is directly in front of you, take it out with the Grenade
Launcher.  Turn right and follow the coast to the first transport, it's hiding
behind a building.  Step on it.

Walk forward to the first ship, sink it, then follow the coast to the third.
Once it's sunk, step on the disc.  Grab some ammo from the warehouses then
follow the road to the next transport.  When you pop out, the fourth ship will
be on your right.  Follow the coast and walk through the city to the fifth
ship.  The sixth and final ship will be offshore, if you angle your Grenade
Launcher high enough, you can hit it.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA has build(sic) a fortress to protect their supplies against UR attacks.
Destroy their defense system and capture all items they are storing inside.

TIPS:

If you know what you're doing this can be a very easy mission!  There is a 
small fortress containing 19 Supply Crates, 2 Repair Crates, and a lot of
defenders.

Start out by walking forward, then when you emerge head right.  Take out any
towers you see with a burst of three Rockets.  Use your Homing Missiles on
aerial units.  The fuel tanks to the right of the fortress contain three
Repair Crates.  Now head towards the eastern door of the fortress.  Hit it
with all your remaining Rockets then use your Chainsaw to finish breaking it
down.  The INSTANT it goes down equip your Shield and run inside.  The crates
are line up in three rows, just ignore the enemies and collect the crates one
row at a time.  Easy!

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

PENTA has built a very large industrial complex consisting of several islands.
Destroy all factories, fuel tanks, and warehouses to stop their weapon
production.

TIPS:

Hard.  Not only are the islands swarming with enemies, there is one you can't
even teleport to!  There are no special tricks here, just clear the island
then teleport to the next.  There are plenty of Ammo and Repair Crates to be
found.  If there is a way to teleport to the small island with the dome, I
can't find it.  You will have to level all buildings (including the dome) by
sniping at it from the two islands closest to it.

 =========================================================================

BRIEFING:

Once again PENTA is attacking our transports to slow down our weapon
production.  Protect the transports and stop the enemy attacks by destroying
the walkers coordinating the illegal activities.  At least 3 trucks have to
survive.

TIPS:

Definitely the hardest mission in the game.  There are three groups of two
transports each making their way through the city.  There are three SATYRs
in the level, take them down on sight with your Rockets.

Really the only thing you can do is walk back and forth through the city
destroying any enemies and barricades you see.  Good luck.

BRIEFING:

Our agents have found PENTA's well protected headquarters on an island.  They
are building a new weapon called COLD IRON GUNNER there.  Destroy this unit
before PENTA is able to complete the weapon and uses it to crush the UR.

TIPS:

Wow...talk about anti-climatic, this is a fairly easy mission and the Cold Iron
Gunner is actually easier to kill than an Iron Soldier!

Just follow the coast on the left and avoid going into the cities themselves.
When you reach the end, a building will explode and the Cold Iron Gunner will
appear.  Just pump it full of Grenades and it will go down quickly.  Too easy.

 ===================================================

Comments:

Basically your I.S.'s punch.  Since you can never mount a weapon in your left
hand, you will always have this available.  You must be right next to your
target, you will see puff of smoke if you land a hit.

 ===================================================

Comments:

This appears to do the same amount of damage as your Manipulator, but at a
much higher rate of speed.  The Chain Cutter is useful for destroying
buildings and enemy Iron Soldiers, but little else.  The biggest drawback is
that if you have the Chain Cutter equipped, you can't carry a Rifle nor a
Shotgun.

Comments:

How many other games can you think of where you begin the game with the most
powerful weapon already available?  Grenades work well against tough, slow
moving enemies like Iron Soldiers and ships.  Grenades are thrown in a high,
awkward arc, making it difficult to hit your target.

Comments:

You'll use this more than any other weapon.  The Gatling Gun has a very high
rate of fire making it an excellent choice for small, fast enemies and also for
shooting down enemy missiles.  The closer you are to your target, the more
damage you'll do.  The Gatling Gun's lone drawback is its short range.

F.  Sable Cruise Missile

 ===================================================
| Weapon:  Sable Cruise Missile                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| Found:      Mission 2                             |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| Mounts:     Left/Right Shoulders                  |
|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Ammo:       1           | Max:     x2             |
|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Range:      Long        | Speed:   Slow           |
|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Precision:  High        | Damage:  High (Lethal?) |
 ===================================================

Comments:

A weapon that's coolness is only matched by its uselessness.  After firing a
Cruise Missile, you switch to an inside camera view.  Fly the missile using the
joypad and press B to detonate (or just ram your target).  Your ammo meter here
is really the fuel gauge.  The game lists the damage stat as "High" but the
instruction manual says it is equal to a Grenade (Lethal).  There are two
reasons this weapon is useless: first is that you only get ONE shot per mount,
secondly a Cruise Missile will only kill SATYRs or weaker with one hit (unlike
in Iron Soldier 1 where a single missile could sink a ship!).  Mission 4 is the
only mission they come in handy, leave them in the hangar for the rest.

|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Precision:  Poor        | Damage:  High           |
 ===================================================

Comments:

A definite upgrade from the Assault Rifle, the Shotgun is capable of destroying
all minor enemies with a single shot!  Like the Gatling Gun, the Shotgun has a
short range and the closer you are to your target, the more damage you'll 
inflict.

| Precision:  N/A         | Damage:  Defense        |
 ===================================================

Comments:

Not a weapon but a defensive item, when the Shield is equipped damage from
enemies is cut in half.  Unfortunately you are unable to use any other weapons
while the Shield is equipped.  You CAN still step on enemies.  Like the Cruise
Missile the Shield's usefulness is limited BUT Mission 17 is tailor made for
it.

I.  Charlotte Rail Cannon

|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Precision:  High        | Damage:  High           |
 ===================================================

Comments:

It sounded so wonderful in the instruction manual: a high powered weapon with
INFINITE range.  But unfortunately for us it only looks good on paper.  The
Rail Cannon is basically the game's sniper rifle, it is very accurate and can
hit anything you can see onscreen.  It does about the same amount of damage as
a Shotgun blast  So what could be wrong?  Three things:  it's actually too
accurate, you have to have your target dead center in your sights in order to
hit it, the rate of fire is slower than the Shotgun, and you only get 25
rounds.  The best use for the Rail Cannon is taking out parachuting enemies
before they can land.

J.  WolfPack Rocket Launcher

| Weapon:  WolfPack Rocket Launcher                 |

|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Precision:  High        | Damage:  High           |
 ===================================================

Comments:

One of the best weapons in the game, the Rocket Launcher combines power and
range with a high rate of fire.  You can carry up to four Rocket Launchers
at a time for a total of 48 Rockets!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
K.  Ferret Homing Missiles

 ===================================================
| Weapon:  Ferret Homing Missiles                   |

|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Precision:  Lethal      | Damage:  High           |
 ===================================================

Comments:

Basically the Rocket Launcher with heat seeking.  Perfect for taking care of
those pesky aerial units.  The only drawback is that you get 6 shots per mount.
You will automatically lock on to the enemy closest to the targeting reticule
(not closest to your Iron Soldier).  Fire with B.

L.  Carlisle 75MM Heavy Machinegun

 ===================================================
| Weapon:  Carlisle 75MM Heavy Machinegun           |

|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Precision:  High        | Damage:  High           |
 ===================================================

Comments:

The best hand weapon in the game.  The Heavy Machinegun is more powerful
than the Assault Rifle and has a longer range.  It's also fully automatic, so
hold down that B button!

M.  Corinne Automatic Grenade Launcher

|-------------------------+-------------------------|
| Precision:  Poor        | Damage:  High           |
 ===================================================

Comments:

The best weapon in the game.  The Grenade Launcher fires a less powerful
version of the Hand Grenade but it is much easier to aim and you get to carry
100 rounds!  Excellent against ground units, the only downside is that it takes
up BOTH hip mounts.
 
*******************************************************************************
VII.   Enemies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  'Glaive' Helicopter

Small but annoying.  Glaives will either attack with gunfire or Rockets.  They
like to attack in groups, so be on your guard.  Don't waste Rockets on them
unless absolutely necessary, you're handheld weapons should make short work of
them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  'Greave' V.T.O.L.

Similar to a Glaive, but more dangerous.  Instead of Rockets, Greaves make
short bombing runs on your Iron Soldier.  You'll want to take them out as soon
as you can, they can drain your life quickly.  Like Glaives, Greaves are best
dealt with using your handheld weapons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  'Gantlet' Attack Plane

Gantlets are large planes that will make bombing runs over the battlefield.
Like Greaves they are very dangerous, especially during escort missions.  To
take out a Gantlet you will need a long range weapon.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  'Wyvern' Jet Fighter

"Pesky" is the best word to describe the Wyverns.  They attack with Rockets
using hit and run tactics.  Homing Missiles are the only weapon effective
against Wyverns.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  'ROC' Transport Plane

ROCs are those large stealth bomber looking planes that drop off enemy units
by parachute.  It's usually best to ignore the ROCs themselves and concentrate
on taking out the parachuters while they are floating helplessly down to earth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  'Brassard' Light Tank

These little guys are everywhere!  Brassards will attack using gunfire or the
occasional Rocket.  Use your handheld weapons...or just stomp on them with your
feet!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G.  'Basilisk' Fast Attack Vehicle

Basilisks are similar to Brassards but a lot deadlier.  Armed with Rockets, a
small group of Basilisks can demolish your Iron Soldier in seconds.  Like other
minor units, they are most economically dealt with using handheld weapons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
H.  'Tasset' Heavy Tank

Brassards on steroids.  When dealing with a Brassard, you're going to want to
use either explosives or your Chain Cutter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.  'Behemoth' Frigate

Behemoths are floating fortresses that attack from offshore using Rockets.
They are very tough to sink.  Unlike Iron Soldier 1, Cruise Missiles are
completely useless against ships in this game.  You'll need to use Grenades,
Rockets, or the Rail Gun.  It takes a whopping 18 Rockets or 21 rounds from
your Rail Gun to sink a Behemoth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
J.  'Javelin' Rocket Launcher

A stationary Basilisk, Javelins are armed with only two Rockets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
K.  'Heaume' Gun Turret

A stationary Brassard.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
L.  'SATYR' War Strider

Iron Soldier "lites", SATYRs move much quicker than an I.S. but have lighter
armor.  Rockets, Grenades, or even a Cruise Missile are effective ways of
dealing with them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
M.  Iron Soldier

The toughest enemies in the game are rogue Iron Soldiers.  Fortunately they are
few and far between.  Iron Soldiers are armed with Rockets and also have a 
vicious punch.  The best ways to take them out are with Hand Grenades or to use
hit and run tactics with the Chain Cutter.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
N.  Cold Iron Gunner

PENTA's "secret weapon" the Cold Iron Gunner is like a cross between an Iron
Soldier and a hovercraft.  You face off against the CIG at the end of the final
mission.  It's armed with Rockets and can move faster than a SATYR but it's
armor is weaker than an Iron Soldier's.

SATYR WALKER

The SATYR walker moves three times faster than an Iron Soldier but has much
lighter armor.  You can't customize your weapon load with the SATYR, you
will always be armed with a Heavy Machinegun, Rocket Launcher, and Homing
Missiles.  Instead of the numpad use the Option button to switch weapons.

IX.    Game Review

Iron Soldier 2 for the Atari Jaguar CD is the sequel to one of the best
received games for the Atari Jaguar.

The graphics in Iron Soldier 2 are top notch for a Jaguar title.  Buildings
and enemies are well rendered while maintaining a butter smooth framerate.
There are three CGI cinematics: one for the intro, one for game over, and one
for completing the game.  While not exactly Final Fantasy 7 caliber, they are
well done and add to the overall experience.  Unfortunately you can't skip the
death sequence, which does get old quickly.

Acoustically the game shines as well.  Explosions and gunfire sound convincing
and the music fits the gameplay perfectly.  The only downside is a lack of
voice-overs, they would have been a nice touch, particularly for the mission
briefings.

The gameplay is what makes Iron Soldier 2 great.  Walking around in a giant
robot suit blasting bad guys is very cool and so much fun.  You start the game
with only a handful of weapons but earn more as you progress.  There are four
new weapons including the lethal Homing Missiles and the awesome Grenade 
Launcher.

Really the only bad thing I have to say about this game is that it is too hard!
Even on Easy the game can be very frustrating at times, especially during the
escort missions.  The challenge is also unbalanced, most of the easiest
missions in the game are the ones in the third and fourth groups.

Iron Soldier 2 is an excellent title and a must-own for any fan of the Jaguar
CD.

Pros
+  Excellent graphics.
+  Smooth framerate.
+  Great soundtrack
+  Good variety of weapons.
+  Lots of fun!

Cons
-  Very difficult even on Easy.
-  Uneven challenge, third and fourth groups have some of the easiest missions
   in the game!
-  A lot of mission briefings are ambiguous leaving it up to you to figure out
   what your mission objectives are.
-  Can't skip death cinematic.
