- WHAT IS DEFENDER 2000?

        Defender 2000 is based upon the original arcade game 
        manufactured by Williams in the early eighties with a 
        90's spin.  It is being programmed by Llamasoft, namely
        Jeff Minter.

        It will offer fast, smooth graphics while
        retaining excellent playability.  Jeff's personal goal
        for the game:  "To make your thumbs bleed!"


################################################################
- WHAT IS THE PLOT?

As society evolved, our natural resources became depleted.  We 
searched for other ways to supplement these resources.  Today, 
teams of Miners excavate a nearby Asteroid Belt for its life-
supplying minerals.  As a member of an elite System Defense Team, 
it is your job to ensure the safety of the Asteroids and the 
workers that live on them.

But all is not roses.

The hostile Alpha Proximian Empire has failed at an invasion of 
our planet.  With their failure, they have issued an attack on 
the Asteroid Mining Belt.  The Alpha Proximian Empire knows that 
if they can destroy our resources, we will be helpless - and they 
will rule.  The invasion fleet has orders to abduct the Humanoids 
working in the belt.  Knowing that their life is doomed, the 
Humanoids will kill them selves upon leaving the Asteroid's 
atmosphere.  In this situation, the 'energy' of the Humanoid will 
be absorbed into the Lander's ship and turn it into a Mutant.

This is were you come in, with your attack ship AKA "Threshold", 
the salvation of the planet relies in your many years of 
training.  Kill all the aliens before the Humanoids are 
sacrificed or the Asteroid will be destroyed along with the place 
that you call "Home".

- WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT GAMES IN D2K?



        Defender 2000 is a combination of three games:

                1.   Defender Classic
                2.   Defender Plus
                3.   Defender 2000

        DEFENDER CLASSIC:  
        The name says it all.  A carbon copy of the original.
        This version will contain sampled sound effects from
        the original arcade game.

        DEFENDER PLUS:
        Defender Plus retains the same format as the classic
        With a few twists.
        Expect to see more detailed animations of the game
        characters, new weapons, and most of the features of 
        Defender's sequel - Stargate!  There will also be a new
        control method.  A new routine for the game's explosions
        will cause the average player to enter a hypnotic state 
        and worship llamas.
        The A.I. Droid from T2K will make a return appearance
        with a larger dose of intelligence.  These Droids, I say
        Droids because you can accumulate two, will toast nearby 
        enemies as well as rescue falling humanoids.

        DEFENDER 2000:
        Anything Goes!  Look for lots of new meanies and mega
        weapons.  Go Vertical, scroll that is.  2000 will offer
        horizontal and vertical movement of your Defender allowing
        for some big guys to fill the screen.  Beautiful, detailed
        backgrounds will offset the nasty bad guys.  Just for 
        variety each level will have multiple and different themes.


################################################################
- WHAT KIND OF MUSIC WILL THE GAME HAVE?

        YES!  The score for D2K will be performed by the same
        musicians (Imagitec) that created the rippin tunes from T2K.  
        The musicians should have at least twice the MEG to 
        work with (the project is leaning toward the CD media).
        
        A feature call "Q Sound" will be utilized in the game.
        "Q Sound" is a recording process which produces three
        dimensional sound from conventional stereo speakers.

        A music feature that was absent from T2K, a sound check,
        may be available in the finished version of D2K.
        Expect to hear some sweet samples in the soundtrack.
        And don't be surprised to hear a beastie bleating or mooing
        in there somewhere!  I wonder who thought of that? :)


################################################################
- HOW MANY PLAYERS?

        Right now the main focus is on a one player game.  But
        there are a few maybes:
        
                Two players with player #2 controlling the A.I. Droid

                Two players with a split screen for the 2K version.

        JagNET and Modem capabilities not yet decided.

        * Remember that these are NOT definite!

################################################################
- HOW MANY LEVELS?

        Lots!  Expect it to surpass T2K by containing 100 or 
        more levels!


################################################################
- WHAT IS THE GAME CONTROL LIKE?

   In Classic there are two modes:

        1. Standard: up/down/left/right on the joypad,
                         no Thrust button

        2. Arcade: a configurable pad with Thrust/Reverse buttons



In Plus/2K contains Standard controls with the additions:
        
        Holding the fire button will produce continuous rapid fire. 
        While firing use left/right, and you can accelerate in 
        either direction while holding the ship orientation 
        constant.  This will allow you to shoot at an enemy 
        while retreating from it.

        Button C:  Smart Bomb
        Button B:  Fire
        Button A:  Llightning Llaser/Tractorbeam
        Keypad keys 3,6,9,#:  Hyperspace


################################################################
- WILL THERE BE ANY EASTER EGGS?

        Yes.  Jeff is planning to have a lot.  The more there are,
        the more people will talk about the game.
        Some of the EEs being considered:

        Turn all the humanoids into llamas.

        Turn you ship into Flossie the Prettiest Sheep in the World.

        Some hidden Llamasoft classic games.


################################################################
- WHAT OTHER FEATURES WILL THE GAME CONTAIN?

        Bonus Rounds!  D2K will contain transitional bonus rounds
        similar to T2K.  Expect them to be based upon the same
        mind altering 1st perspective rounds in T2K.

        Game AI.  One of the major complaints of the original Defender
        game was the difficulty of learning how to play the game.
        The learning cure has been flattened to allow 'Greenhorns'
        to become addicted to the game instead of becoming 
        frustrated and tossing the cart.  Expert players need not
        fret, for the higher levels are challenging even to the
        gamers with three eyes.  This way everyone will enjoy the 
        game.

        If the game is pressed to a CD.  There may even be some 
        Defender history worked into the game.  The possibility
        of an interview with Eugene Jarvis the creator of Defender,
        Stargate and Robotron has been discussed.
        
        60Hz, 60Hz, 60Hz!  This game is going to be FAST!


################################################################
                                - RUMORS -

        There may be an occasional 'Offender' wave where you get
        to commit alien genocide.
