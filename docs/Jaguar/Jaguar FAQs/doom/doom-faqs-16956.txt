********************** 1) INTRODUCTION/REVISIONS ************************
=========================================================================

INTRODUCTION - This is my guide to the excellent FPS game DOOM on the Atari
Jaguar Console.  This game is legendary and has appeared on many different
consoles.  Each version is usually slightly different from others so a guide
for one may not be as helpful for another.  For example the PC version contains
27 levels, this one contains only 24.  Many of the level names in the PC
version refer to completely different levels named the same in the jaguar
versions. This is why I have done a Jaguar specific version.  I found this
version one of the more enjoyable versions I have played.  The multi button
Jaguar pad suits the weapons selection very well and movement and strafing was
relatively easy to do in the heat of battle.  There weren't many decent games
released on the Jaguar, but this is definitely worthwhile purchase if you're an
FPS fan.

In writing this FAQ/Walkthrough the "Official Atari Jaguar Gamers Guide" by
Zach Meston and J. Douglas Arnold (1995) was invaluable in helping me find all
the secret areas tucked away on each level.

*************************************************************************

REVISIONS - Final Version (06/05/2002).

Wrote up all the weapons, enemy, cheat codes and level walkthroughs.  Plus a
section on the differences between the jaguar version and other versions of the
game.  Unless I have made a really crass error and someone emails me to point
it out there will be no more additions to this FAQ.

=========================================================================
***************************** 2) WEAPONS ********************************
=========================================================================

1) FISTS - There is plenty of ammo lying about, if you find yourself reduced to
fists you're in big trouble.  Only any good if you find a berserk pack and then
you can kill stuff with a few punches, otherwise, run away and find some more
ammo!

2) CHAINSAW - Great fun to use against enemies without long range attacks. Use
it to chew up Demons and Cacodemons, ahhh, satisfying!

3) PISTOL - Your default weapon.  Useful in the early levels and holds a nice
lot of ammo.  But once you get past the Imps you're in trouble.  Save it for
the weaker guys and bring out the big guns for the badasses.

4) SHOTGUN - This weapon is the Doomsters best friend.  Powerful enough to take
out all but Cacodemons and Barons of Hell with a few blasts and ammo is usually
plentiful.  Its main disadvantage is the time it takes to reload.  In the early
levels, try strafing left and right while reloading, it will save your life in
later levels.

5) CHAINGUN - This little beauty fires out tonnes of bullets with each hit. 
Although the hits are relatively weak the sheer speed and rate of fire can keep
the enemy on the defensive until they die.  It also uses up ammo VERY quickly,
best kept for Imps and demons and Cacodemons if you are facing off against only
one.

6) ROCKET LAUNCHER - Hooray!  The FPS classic weapon is just as awesome in Doom
as it is in every other game.  But ammo for these is always scarce. When you
find one hold onto it for the real nasties - Cacodemons and Barons of Hell. 
Also take care firing at close range; the explosions can damage you as well as
your target.

7) PLASMA RIFLE - Another fast firing weapon, Balls of Plasma shoot out at a
nice fast rate and can kill most enemies with a single shot.  Not so effective
against Barons of Hell or Cacodemons, but great for taking down Lost Souls and
Demons.

8) BFG 9000 - The daddy of all weapons will kill EVERYTHING with a single
blast. Has little ammo and always hard to find but great for turning the tables
of those damn Hell Barons.  Word of warning, it takes ages for the BFG to power
up after each shot, so be careful when taking on a crowd with it.


=========================================================================
***************************** 3) ENEMIES ********************************
=========================================================================

This version of Doom has only seven enemies to face off against; here they are
from the weakest to the nastiest and the best ways to kill them.

1) ZOMBIEMAN - The reanimated corpse of a dead marine now under the control of
the forces of darkness.  They only carry weak rifles and can be killed with a
couple of blasts from your pistol.  They will drop a pistol ammo clip when they
die.

2) SHOTGUN GUY - A slightly tougher version of zombieman.  He carries a more
powerful rifle but is still pretty weak.  A couple of pistol shots will kill
him and he'll drop shotgun shells when he dies.

3) IMP - Now things are getting a bit tougher.  This pinky red demon can attack
you from long distances with flaming fireballs.  It takes about 6-7 pistol
shots to kill it, but one shotgun blast is usually enough to drop it.

4) DEMON - A nastier fat pink demonic creature.  Can't attack from long range
so it will usually rush you and cause some major mangling to your face.  Don't
bother with your pistol unless you are desperate (over 12 shots to kill it). 
The shotgun can drop it in three blasts, but its better to bring out the big
guns and take it out from a distance.  A rocket launcher or plasma rifle does
the job lovely.

5) LOST SOUL - A floating, flaming skull that will rush you very quickly.  It
can dodge slower long distance weaponry.  Wait until its right in your face and
unleash your shotgun.  Three hits should take it down.

6) CACODEMON - Uuh, nasty.  This is like a big gross floating eyeball that
likes to pound your candy ass with lightening bolts.  Forget your pistol unless
you have a death wish (over 30 hits needed) and the shotgun is not much more
use (6+ shots).  Bring out your Chain Gun to keep it battered and unable to
shoot lightening.  A Chainsaw in the face (eye?) can also cause this blobby
fool to stop attacking you.  Two hits from a Rocket Launcher will also see this
big fat meany splattered all over the level.

7) Baron of Hell - The rottenest and coolest enemy of the lot.  This giant
horned and hoofed demon is VERY tough and likes to get up close and personal. 
Forget anything except the Rocket Launcher, which will take one out in two hits
a plasma rifle (50 rounds) and if you have got your hands of the BFG one hit
will take him out.


=========================================================================
********************** 4) CONTROLS AND AUTOMAP **************************
=========================================================================

1) CONTROLS

In case you have lost you control overlay (bet you have!), here are the
controls for the game.

D-PAD: Move left, right, forward and backward
A BUTTON: Run
B BUTTON: Fire/Use Weapon
C BUTTON: Open doors/Flick Switches

HOLD C BUTTON + D-PAD LEFT or RIGHT - Strafe (Fire weapon at the same time)

PAUSE: Pauses Game
OPTION: Game Options Menu

KEYPAD 1: Select Fists or Chainsaw (if obtained)
KEYPAD 2: Select Pistol
KEYPAD 3: Select Shotgun
KEYPAD 4: Select Chaingun
KEYPAD 5: Select Rocket Launcher
KEYPAD 6: Select Plasma Rifle
KEYPAD 7: BFG 9000

KEYPAD 9: Toggle AutoMap
# + * together: Restart Game.


2) UNDERSTANDING THE AUTOMAP

This is often neglected by many players but is actually a damn useful tool for
helping you navigate though some of the more maze-like levels.  There are
several features to understand:

a) You are represented as a green arrow.  The point of the arrow shows the
direction you are currently pointing in.
b) The map gradually reveals more as you run though the level.  This helps you
retrace you steps when you find the relevant card keys to open the relevant
door.
c) A red line indicates a solid wall, there may be a secret area, but that will
not appear until you find it.
d) A doubled red line indicates a passageway into a previously locked area.
e) A yellow line is an open and explored area
f) A doubled yellow line is a doorway.
g) Multiple yellow lines indicate a hidden platform, bridge or stairway now
discovered.
h) Single grey lines show platforms, ledges, toxic slime pools, obstructions.
i) Double grey lines are windows or balconies.
j) A multiple grey line is a stairway (unused)


=========================================================================
********************* 5) COMPLETE LEVEL WALKTHROUGH *********************
=========================================================================

I have tried to give the quickest guide possible to each level.  But I have
also designed it to cover as many of the secret areas as possible.  It's
basically up to you if you choose to locate all the secret areas.  They count
towards your secrets score at the end of each level.  In earlier levels its not
so important, but in later levels all the super-strong weaponry, extra health
and armour is hidden away, so it may be worth learning to spot the entrances to
secret areas in earlier levels to save time when your having your butt kicked
in later ones!

*************************************************************************
Level 1: Hanger
*************************************************************************

- Go to then end door on the left.  Go up the stairs and take the Security
Armour.  Go back down stairs and turn left.  Go down the corridor and through
the door into the computer room.  Take the east door out of the Computer room
and you'll be on a zigzag bridge.  Cross over the slime pool via this.

- Now look for a lighter section of wall on the right side of the corridor. 
Press C while against it to open it and you'll find a secret passage leading
out to the courtyard.  Go into the courtyard and take the Combat Armour in the
Slime Pool the return to the secret passage.

- Turn right and open the door.  Pick up all the stuff in the room then go back
to the zigzag bridge.  Now the tower with the Imp on top has lowered.  It opens
a new passage, which you can pick up more items and a shotgun.

- In this area near the shotgun is a secret lift (elevator).  You can only open
it by touching a tripwire near the north side of the zigzag bridge.  When it's
tripped you can see and hear the secret elevator opening.  You must run back
before it closes.  Once you get inside, pick up all the items and get out by
jumping down onto the zigzag bridge.  Now turn left and go out through the Exit

open another secret door. Go upstairs in the northeast corner and the secret
door you opened is at the top.  Walk into the courtyard and collect the
chaingun and soul sphere.  Return to the door, go to the top of the stairs and
turn right.  Get the red card and follow the stairs back to the start of the
level.

- Go through the red security door on the west side of the area.  Walk straight

the doors on either side. Both lead to the exit. Go through it now or stay and
find the secrets.  If so, return to the red security door and walk up the north
corridor.  Flip the switch on the east side of the column sitting in the middle
of the slime pool.  This opens a secret door next to the red security door.

- Go through this secret door and explore west until you find the green
security armour.  Shoot at the wall behind the armour to reveal another secret
passage.  At the top of the second flight of stairs, turn to the east and open
a secret door.  Go through a door full of armour bonuses.  Exit and continue
upstairs to the chainsaw area.  Push the switch in the northwest corner to
lower the chainsaw.  Go back down to the maze and work you're way to the

left wall.  This is a timed run to a secret passage, if you fail, return to the
room full of flashing computer banks and try again.

- Once in the secret passage go down the stairs and press the switch on the
pedestal to lower the soul sphere.  Go back down the stairs and run to the next
secret passage behind the computers on the back wall.  There is security armour
and a rocket launcher in this secret room. Jump in the slime and quickly follow
it right through the door.  Press the switch to lower a secret drawbridge at
the start of the level.

- Press on the light brown section of wall and take the items in the secret
area.  Take the first lift then the second with the green armour.  Go upstairs
and left to explore the north section of the refinery. Go north to the oval

go out. Monsters will attack from a secret room behind you.  Shoot them and
return to the start of the level.

- Go to the blue security door.  Go through the door and turn left at the fork
in the slime pool.  Go straight ahead to raise a secret staircase.  At the top
is the Exit, go through now or go back to access the secret level 24.

- Go back to the fork in the slime pool and this timed go right.  Press on the
wall near the light and follow the secret path to the yellow door.  Go through

*************************************************************************
Level 23: Dis
*************************************************************************

Last level, and it's a toughie.  The level isn't very big or hard to navigate,
it's sort of an octagon shape with chambers around the edge, but it's stuffed
with Cacodemons and two nasty barons of Hell.

My advice is do not try and duke it out with the Barons, when the level begins
grab the armour vest nearby (left) and run for the door. Now your in the big
hall with the Cacodemons, keep your finger held down on the fire button and
work your way around the room collecting refills and health as you go.

If your lucky the Barons of Hell will have followed you in and will start a
punch up with some of the cacodemons.  Whatever happens, open the secret door
and push the skull switch.  Take the blue key and open the blue door. Get the
red key and open the red door, and finally grab the yellow key and open the
yellow door.  Walk onto the teleporter and that's it, end of game.

Sit back and watch the very weedy end sequence.  Think yourself lucky endings
are better nowadays!

LEVEL 10: Hold the A Button
LEVELS 11-19: Hold the A Button and the relevant one on the keypad (eg. Level
16 Hold A and 6)

2) LETS HAVE FUN!!!

Well I suggest you try and complete the game once without using the cheats. 
But once you have they can come in handy for some fun game play challenges!

Challenge 1: Activate the HAPPY AMMO and GOD MODE CHEAT.  See how quickly you
can take out all the enemies in the Unholy Cathedral Level using just your
Pistol and Chainsaw.

Challenge 2:  Activate GOD MODE.  See how quickly you can complete the Toxin
Refinery level with just your fists, and no (extra) cheating you must have at
least 75% kills at the end of the level.

Challenge 3:  My favourite!  Activate GOD MODE and warp off to Dis.  Now take
on first the two Barons of Hell and then The Cacodemons with your bare hands. 
You must kill them all! Bwahahahahahaha!

Challenge 4: No cheats codes for this, this is a test of your dodging and
running skills.  See how far you can get without killing anything!  Not a
single shot, you kill % should be a big fat zero.

=========================================================================
***************** 7) JAGUAR DOOM VS. OTHER VERSIONS  ********************

actually looks more like the PC "Fortress of Mystery Level"
- Jaguar version has 24 levels as opposed to the PC versions 27.

played level without needing to enter level passwords.
- Game moves quickly and smoothly and is superior to all console versions
