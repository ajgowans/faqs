*******************************************************************************
I.     Introduction

This is a FAQ for the Atari Jaguar game Brutal Sports Football.  It contains
a list of controls, strategies for winning, passwords, and a mini-review.

*******************************************************************************
II.    Getting Started

Note:  You can press B to skip the intros.

Press B on the Title Screen to bring up the Main Menu.  Press up/down on the
joypad to scroll through the menu and press B to select one of the following:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  League

Choose League to begin a new season.  First you will choose one of the eight
Vikings teams (unfortunately you can't play League with a Lizard, Goat, or
Rhino team).  All of the teams seem to have the same stats, so just pick the
one you think looks the coolest.  If you want, you can change the team's name
by pressing A, then using the joypad to change the letters.  You then choose 
the control scheme you want, be careful, this CANNOT be changed without 
starting over.  For more information on the control schemes, see the Controls
section.  After choosing a control scheme, it's straight on to your first 
match.  For more information on the League mode, see the Game Modes section.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Unfriendly

Choose Unfriendly to play a match against either a friend or the CPU.  First,
player one will choose his team and control scheme.  Then a timer will appear,
player two should press B to be taken to the team selection screen.  If you
are playing a one player game, you can press B to make the timer decrease 
quicker.  If the timer reaches zero, you will play against the CPU.  Finally
you will choose whether to play a single match, best of three, or best of
seven.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Knockout

Choose Knockout to play a single elimination tournament with up to eight 
players as the eight Vikings teams (again, no animals).  First you choose which
teams are going to be controlled by humans by selecting them with the cursor 
and pressing B.  You can change a team's name by pressing A and using the 
joypad to change the letters.  When you have finished choosing teams, press C 
to start.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Password

Choose Password to enter a password and resume a previous game.  To enter the
password, press left/right on the joypad to choose a symbol and press B to
enter.  If you want to erase a symbol, press A.  When you are done entering,
press the C button to confirm your password.  If you entered it correctly,
you will get a message telling you the league and match number.  When you
return to the Main Menu, select League.

Note:  As far as I can tell, there are no passwords that use the bottom row,
       so just leave it as all dashes.

*******************************************************************************
III.   Game Modes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  League

...............................................................................
1.  Leagues

The goal in League mode is to make your way through the four leagues and 
become champion.  You will start out in the 4th League, then move on to the 3rd
League, then the 2nd League, and finally the 1st League.  In each league you
will play each of the three teams twice.

...............................................................................
2.  Promotion/Demotion

After playing six games in a league, one of three things can happen.  If you
won at least four games you will be promoted to the next league.  If you lost
three or more games you will have to replay the league.  If this is your 
second time through and you still didn't win four games, you'll then be
DEMOTED to the previous league!

...............................................................................
3.  Victory/Defeat

After winning a game you will earn cash based on your performance.  You will
receive 20,000 for every goal you scored and 25,000 for every opponent you
killed.  If you lost the game, you will NOT receive cash for goals but you DO
receive cash for your kills.

...............................................................................
4.  Post Game Screen

On the Post Game Screen you will have several choices.  Choose Next Match/
Next League to play the next game.  Choose Locker Room to go into the Locker
Room and heal your players.  Choose Show Result to see your current password.
Show Stats will show you the stats from your previous game.

...............................................................................
5.  Champion/Game Over

You become champion and win the game by winning at least four matches in the 
1st League.  (Yes, you can still become champion even if you lose your final
match!)

If at any point you are unable to field a team of at least three players, your
game will end.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Unfriendly

Unfriendly let's you play a single, best of three, or best of seven match
against either a friend or the CPU.  Unlike other modes, in Unfriendly you CAN
play as animal teams!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Knockout

Knockout is an eight team single elimination tournament.  It can be played with
up to eight players, the remaining teams will be controlled by the CPU.  Only
Viking teams will be available to choose from.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Control Schemes

The five control schemes affect how you select/switch players during gameplay.
I strongly recommend using the Advanced control scheme.

Note:  Once you choose a control scheme in League mode, it CANNOT be changed,
       you'll have to begin a new League mode!

...............................................................................
1.  Novice

In the Novice control scheme, the CPU will automatically select the player you
control.  On offense, this will always be the ball carrier.  On defense, it 
will be the player closest to the ball.

...............................................................................
2.  Beginner

In the Beginner control scheme, the CPU will automatically select the player 
you control.  On offense, this will always be the ball carrier.  On defense, it
will be the player closest to the ball.  By pressing the Option button, you
will lock in control of the current player and the CPU will not switch control
from that player until you press Option again.  While a player's control is
locked, a sword will appear on the 1P/2P marker.

...............................................................................
3.  Intermediate

In the Intermediate control scheme, the CPU will automatically select the 
player you control.  On offense, this will always be the ball carrier.  On 
defense, it will be the player closest to the ball.  The CPU will not switch
control to another player until you release the joypad and all buttons.

...............................................................................
4.  Advanced

In the Advanced control scheme, the CPU will automatically select the player 
you control.  On offense, this will always be the ball carrier.  On defense, it
will be the player closest to the ball.  The CPU will not switch control to
another player until you release the joypad and all buttons.

By pressing the Option button, you will lock in control of the current player 
and the CPU will not switch control from that player until you press Option 
again.  While a player's control is locked, a sword will appear on the 1P/2P 
marker.

...............................................................................
5.  Expert

In the Expert control scheme, there is no automatic player selection.  You must
press the Option button when you wish to switch players.

Note:  In this control scheme, you will NOT automatically switch to the ball
       carrier, you will still need to press Option!

*******************************************************************************
V.     Rules of Brutal Football

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Rules

Rule #1:  There are NO rules!

Brutal Football is like a cross between (American)football and soccer.  The
game is played between two teams of at least three but no more than seven 
players each.  Each game lasts seven minutes.

At the beginning of each game (and after each score), the ref walks to midfield 
and tosses the ball into the air and play OFFICIALLY begins (as there are no
rules, you can start moving around and bashing opponents as soon as you like).

The ball can be carried, thrown, or punted.  Forward passes and recovering your
own punts are both perfectly legal.

Points are scored when the ball enters the other teams goal.  It can be thrown
in, run in, punted in, etc., once the ball crosses the goal line, it's a score!

There are no penalties, so attack your opponent as often as you can, there are
even weapons lying around the playing field!  Dead players CANNOT be replaced
by subs during a match.  A team with one or fewer players remaining will
automatically forfeit the match, even if they are ahead in goals!

A team wins the game by either scoring more points or killing all but one of
the opposing players.  If the score is tied at the end of the game, play goes
into Sudden Death.  In Sudden Death, the first team to kill all but one of
their opponents wins.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  HUD

At the top left of the screen will be two bars, the top represents the health
of player one's selected character and the bottom one represents player one's
overall team health.  The bars on the top right are for player two.  At the top
of the screen is also the timer.  It starts at 7:00 and counts down to zero.
At the bottom left is player one's score and at the bottom right is player
two's.  The black rectangle at the top of the screen is the radar.  The dots
represent all of the players, flashing colored dots represent the selected
players, white flashing dots are powerups, and the solid white dot is the ball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Formations

There are no set plays in Brutal Sports Football.  Instead, you can change the
formation of your players by pressing 1, 2, or 3 on the numpad.

...............................................................................
1.  Defense

Press 1 on the numpad to change your formation to Defense.  This will line up
all of your team's players on your side of the field.  This is useful when you
have the lead and want to protect it.

...............................................................................
2.  Normal

Press 2 on the numpad to change the formation to Normal.  In this formation,
half of your players will stay on your side of the field and the other half
will be on the opponent's side.  This is the default formation and is the best
one to use in most circumstances.

...............................................................................
3.  Aggressive

Press 3 on the numpad to change the formation to Aggressive.  This will move
all of your players (except the goalie) to the opponent's side of the field.
This formation is good for when your down and need to score some quick goals.

*******************************************************************************
VI.    Locker Room

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Locker Room Overview

The Locker Room will be available after each match in League mode.  Here you
can heal wounds, increase the players' speed, even revive dead players!

You'll see your nine players inside the pods.  A standing player is in good
health, a kneeling player is in poor health, and a player with bandages for a
head is dead.  Above each player is an oval.  The number in the oval is that
player's number.  Player #1 is your goalie, be sure that he is always fully
healed!  On each side of the number is a red bar, these represent your player's
health.

All treatments cost money, your remaining cash is displayed in the center of
the Locker Room.  To apply treatment to a player, move the joypad left/right to
select him, then press up to raise the door to the pod.  Press up/down to
select the cross (First Aid), lightning bolt (Speed Boost), or helmet (Revive).
Press B to perform that treatment.  If you highlight the machine in the center 
of the Locker Room, you can press up to select all the players at once and
provide the treatment to all of them (I don't recommend doing this).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  First Aid

Apply First Aid to treat a player's wounds.  Each treatment restores a little
bit of health, a player may need several treatments to be fully restored.  Each
First Aid treatment costs 5,000.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Speed Boost

Apply a Speed Boost to increase a player's speed.  A player can have a maximum
of three Speed Boosts at a time.  Speed Boosts will wear off over time and cost
20,000 each.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Revive

Choose Revive to perform cranial reconstruction and bring a dead player back to
life.  A revived player will have zero health, so you'll still need to perform
First Aid afterwards.  Each Revive costs 20,000.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Selection

Your team has nine players, but only seven can play in a match.  Choosing the
Select option from the machine in the center of the Locker Room will
automatically select the first seven LIVING players.

To manually select/deselect a player, simply highlight him and press the A
button.  You MUST have at least three living players to start a match.  If you
exit the Locker Room with a team of fewer than seven players and you still 
have other living players, these will be automatically added to your team!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
F.  Exiting

To exit the Locker Room, choose the Exit option from the machine in the center.
You can also exit the Locker Room at any time by pressing the C Button.

*******************************************************************************
VII.   Strategies

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Face-Off

-  On a face-off, the CPU will not start moving until the referee tosses the
   ball.  Use this to your advantage and get in some extra licks!

-  I always immediately run over to the opponent across from me and start 
   punching.

-  Instead of going right for the ball, move your player out of the way, then
   attack the opposing players as they go for the ball.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Offense

-  Try to kill the opponent's goalie as soon as possible to make scoring a LOT
   easier!

-  For easy scores, try punting the ball at the opponent's 40 yard line.  When
   control switches to your player in front of the goal, immediately tackle the
   goalie.

-  Try punting the ball when you are in front of the opponent's goal, then
   tackling the goalie after he jumps up to grab it.

-  If your player has full Speed Boost (or a Rabbit) try running at a diagonal
   from top to bottom in front of your opponent's goal.  If you time it right
   the goalie will leap at you and miss, leaving you with a clear shot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Defense

-  It's a good idea to punt the ball whenever you get it on your own side of
   the field.

-  Whenever your goalie gets the ball, punt IMMEDIATELY.

-  Unless you have an Ice Cube or Lightning powerup, NEVER run the ball up
   the field with your goalie.

-  When your opponent activates the Running Ball powerup, immediately start
   attacking the highlighted opponent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Locker Room

-  Player 1 is your goalie.  ALWAYS make sure that he is fully healed and
   selected.

-  Only seven of your nine players play in each game.  Don't waste money
   healing players that won't play!

-  The max amount of money you can bank is 999,000.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E.  Miscellaneous

-  I STRONGLY recommend using the ADVANCED control scheme.

-  As long as you win at least four games in the 1st League, you'll be crowned
   champion, even if you lost your final match!

-  Dominate your opponents in the lower leagues to build up a reserve of cash.

-  Collect powerups as soon as you see them to prevent your opponent from
   using them.

-  The only bad powerup is the Tortoise, avoid it at all costs.

-  Each goal earns you 20,000, but ONLY if you win.

-  You earn 25,000 for each opponent killed win OR lose!

-  If you are down by too many points to win, immediately start head hunting.
   You can still salvage a victory by killing six opponents and even if you
   don't win, the heads will earn you some cash.

-  Remember that passwords do NOT save Speed Boosts!  It's usually a good idea
   to write down your passwords BEFORE going to the Locker Room.

-  Get in the habit of going to the Locker Room after entering a password.

-  When playing in an Unfriendly Match, choose the Rhino team.

*******************************************************************************
VIII.  Weapons and Powerups

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Weapons

...............................................................................
1.  Weapons Overview

Weapons will be found laying all over the playing field.  To pick up a weapon,
simply run over it.  If you run over a second weapon, your first one will be
dropped and replaced with the new one.  Weapons cannot be carried when you have
the ball.  After a score, any weapons players are holding will be dropped.  To
attack with a weapon, press the B button.

...............................................................................
2.  Sword

The sword will do more damage than your fists.

...............................................................................
3.  Axe

The axe is a long range weapon.  Press B to throw it in the direction you're
facing.

...............................................................................
4.  Shield

The shield has two functions: you can use it to attack like the sword (it does
less damage), but it will also protect you from enemy attacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  Powerups

...............................................................................
1.   Powerups Overview

Powerups are found on the playing field.  To collect a powerup, simply run over
it.  The Rabbit, Tortoise, and Grenades will be activated instantly, the rest
will be stored until you activate them.  You can store up to three powerups at
a time.  To scroll through your powerups, press 6.  To activate a powerup,
press the A button.

After a score, all ACTIVE powerups will expire, but any STORED powerups will
still be available.

...............................................................................
2.   Rabbit

The Rabbit powerup will increase the speed of your players for a short time.
This powerup is activated as soon as you touch it.

...............................................................................
3.   Tortoise

The Tortoise powerup will DECREASE the speed of your players for a short time.
This powerup is activated as soon as you touch it.

...............................................................................
4.   Grenades

The Grenades powerup will grant you six grenades to use against your opponents.
This power up is activated as soon as you touch it, press A to lob a grenade.
If you are tackled while carrying grenades, you'll drop your remaining grenades
and they'll damage whoever's nearby.

...............................................................................
5.   Magic Potion

The Magic Potion will turn all members of your team invisible for a short
while.  Please be aware that the 1P/2P icons will still be visible.

...............................................................................
6.   Running Ball

The Running Ball powerup will cause the ball to sprout legs and run towards 
your selected player.  While the ball has legs, the other team will NOT be
able to pick it up.

...............................................................................
7.   Bomb

The Bomb powerup is mentioned in the instruction booklet and says it gives
"bigger bangs to wipe out the opposition".  I've never seen this one so I don't
know what it does.

...............................................................................
8.   Repel Icon

The Repel Icon will create a force field around your selected player.

...............................................................................
9.   Ice Cube

The Ice Cube will temporarily freeze all of your opponents.

...............................................................................
10.  Lightning

The Lightning powerup will temporarily call down lightning bolts that will
strike down any opponents who approach the ball.

...............................................................................
11.  Fist

The Fist powerup isn't mentioned in the instruction booklet.  It appears to
increase your attack power so that one punch will stun an opponent for a few
seconds.

...............................................................................
12.  Fire

The Fire powerup isn't mentioned in the instruction booklet either.  It will
cause your player to automatically spit out fireballs to take out opponents.

...............................................................................
13.  Direction Reverse

This powerup only appears in two player games.  It will reverse the directions
on your opponents joypad.

...............................................................................
14.  Team Swap

This powerup also only appears in two player games.  It will swap team controls
of the two players.

*******************************************************************************

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
D.  Rhinos

Rhinos are the best teams in the game!  They are stronger, tougher and faster
than anybody on the field.  Like Vikings, they'll stomp on downed opponents,
except their weight causes a lot more damage!

Playable Teams:  Rhinos (Unfriendly only)

Non Playable Teams:  Maulers, Mad Herd, Mammoths

A.  League Mode Bug "Fix"

RMVVKKL343  333VZ6387

This code has been floating around the internet for years.  Supposedly there
is a severe bug in the League Mode and it can be fixed by entering this 
password (said to be supplied by Telegames).  The only "bug" I have encountered
is the passwords don't save your  Speed Boosts, and this password certainly 
doesn't fix that!

I am pretty sure this is just one big hoax, if you enter the password, you'll
be at the 3rd match in the 3rd league.  Eight of your players are dead and the
remaining one is within an inch of his life.  You also only get 250,000 to
patch up your severely roughed up team.  To top it off, you're stuck with 
Novice controls!

XI.    Game Review

Brutal Sports Football is an excellent sports game for the Atari Jaguar.  It
combines elements of football and soccer, then throws in some weapons for good
measure!  The object of the game is simple, either outscore or out slaughter
your opponent.  Teams are composed of either Vikings, Lizards, Goats, or Rhinos
each with their own abilities.  Unfortunately, you are only able to play as the
Vikings in all but one of the game modes.

There are several game modes including a League mode and two player versus
"Unfriendly" matches.  The Unfriendly matches can also be played against the
CPU.  The League mode consists of playing your way through four leagues of six
games each in order to become champion.  After each game, you can use your
winnings to heal your players wounds and boost their speed.

Overall, Brutal Sports Football is a great game with a few glaring flaws.  The
graphics look like something off the SNES instead of a 64-bit system.  Being
able to play the League mode as the other three races would have really upped
the replay value, there is no excuse for not allowing this.  Finally, there is
no difficulty setting.  The game is a bit on the easy side, you won't really be
challenged until you start playing in the final league.

While the graphics may not be anything special, Brutal Sports Football is an
absolute blast to play and a must own for any Jaguar fan.

Pros

-  Game is a lot of fun!
-  Four different types of teams, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
-  Lots of weapons and powerups to keep the game interesting.
-  Two player versus mode.
-  Passwords to save your progress.

Cons

-  No difficulty levels.
-  Can only play League games as a Vikings team.
-  No two player co-op mode.
-  Graphics are SNES caliber.
