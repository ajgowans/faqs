INTRODUCTION - Oh blimey, not another useless Jaguar game FAQed by yours truly.
 Well I have to justify buying the console somehow.  Only joking, I love my
Jaguar.  However "Dragon - The Bruce Lee Story" is not a very good game.  It's
a conversion of the 16bit SNES version with absolutely no extras or spiffing up
of the graphics as far as I can see.  But I think a Jaguar specific FAQ is
going to be useful for this game as the controls have been totally messed up in
the conversion making it even harder to play than its 16bit cousin!

So other than that, it's not a huge game.  Simply 10 levels of fighting
"action" with only Brucie as a selectable character and some half-assed
two-player modes added in.  It's loosely based on the rather crummy film
"Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story" which came out in 1993 and starred Jason Scott
Lee (no relation).  It's not the best representation of Brucies life it has to
be said, so I've included a quick plot description from the manual to save you
the pain of viewing it.  Well enjoy the FAQ!


*******************************************************************************

REVISIONS - (Version 1.0) 16/01/2004

Well version 1.0 done with all the moves, modes and levels covered.  Next
update most likely to be the last.

Final Version (29/03/2004) - Guide was pretty much complete when it first went
up, so I have just fixed some typoes and fiddled with the formatting and that's
it, I shall not be doing any more work on this guide.

===============================================================================
****************************** 2) THE BASICS **********************************
===============================================================================

THE PLOT - (courtesy of the manual) "No single teacher, artist or film star had
more impact on the martial arts than Bruce Lee.  His influence still lives on
in Hollywood stars such as Stephen Segal and Jean Claude Van Damme, who have
followed in his supremely choreographed footsteps.

Born in San Francisco on November 27 1940 - the year of the dragon - Lee was
christened Li Jun Fan.  The name means return to San Francisco, since his
mother, who was to take the family back to Hong Kong less than a year after his
birth, felt a return to that city was part of his destiny.

Indeed it was. After a turbulent upbringing, listed as a juvenile delinquent
and in regular trouble with the police, Lee's parents paid for martial arts
lessons in an attempt to shield their son from further harm. Unfortunately for
Bruce, no one could save him from his own personal fears.  These were
personified by THE PHANTOM or Mythical Samurai which was to plague his thoughts
and dreams throughout his life.

Lee learnt a style known as Wing Chun, named after the woman who developed it.
Its is a stripped down version of kung fu relying on low kicks and a defensive
style known as chi sao or "sticking hands".  This technique which involves
responding to your opponents moves by deflecting their blows with minimal
efforts.  Bruce took this style and refined his own idea, "no form" or Jun Fan,
from it.  A blend of many styles including karate, savate, judo and even
Muhammad Ali's boxing, it was actually inspired by sword fighting, working on
the concept of parry and counter in one movement.  It became known as Jeet Kune
Do, the stop-fast hitting style.

At the age of 18 he returned to San Francisco as his name had predicted.  He
earned cash as a waiter at his aunt's restaurant, giving dancing lessons and
demonstrating martial arts. However it was by giving private lessons to
wealthier clients from the film industry such as Steve MacQueen, James Coburn
and Elvis Presley that earned him both a living and the contacts he needed in
Hollywood to launch his film career.

After a difficult start, Lee achieved some fame on both sides of the Pacific.
But it was the success of Way of the Dragon that finally gave Bruce his big
break in Hollywood. Enter the Dragon was his first feature there.  With its
fast-paced sequences and violent combat action it made him a world-wide
celebrity.  To date, the film has grossed $200 million, making it one of the
most commercially successful movies ever made.

Bruce Lee was pronounced dead on July 20 1973, aged 32.  Newspaper reports
concerning an affair, rivalry with business associates and rumours that he had
refused to pay protection money to the Triads, continue to give credence to the
conspiracy theories that suggest he was poisoned.  Indeed traces of drugs
discovered at his post-mortem continue to shroud his death in mystery.  Some
say he fought his final battle against The Phantom and lost.

To this day he continues to be front page news in the Far East where his legend
remains undimmed."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BRUCE'S MOVES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bruce does have quite a few moves at his disposal, and also three modes he can
fight in.  His normal/mantis mode gives him plenty of offensive and defensive
moves.  Fighter mode gives him a reduced set of moves and makes it easier to
suffer a stun, but gives him great speed and power.  Finally Nunchuka mode
gives him a handful of super-powerful Nunchuka moves.  These two modes can be
accessed by filling up Bruce's chi metre. You fill up the Chi metre by
performing successful attacks.

One thing is notable about this game is that, unlike the SNES game it's based
on, the Jaguar has to cope with a three button pad layout, rather than four.
So in a stroke of programming stupidity, Hard Punch and Hard Kick are on the
same button and have to be toggled using the OPTION button. Gah!

- CONTROLS

A = Hard Kick/Hard Punch
B = Fast Punch
C = Fast Kick

Option = Toggle Hard Kick/Punch

Pause = Pause Game/Bring Up In Game Options by pressing A, B or C

# and * = Restart Game


NORMAL (MANTIS) MODE

- CLOSE RANGE MOVES (perform when right up against an opponent)

Knee             Fast Kick
Shin Kick        Fast Kick (when opponent is crouching)
Throw            back + Fast Punch
High Kick        Hard Kick
Stomp            up, down (while opponent is grounded)

- SHORT RANGES MOVES (perform when a few steps away from opponent)

Forearm Smash    Fast Punch x 3
                 Hard Punch x 2
Low Punch        down + Hard Punch
Low Fast Kick    down + Fast Kick
Low Hard Kick    down + Hard Kick

- MEDIUM RANGE MOVES

Roundhouse       Hard Kick x 2
Reverse Kick     back + Hard Kick x 2
Split Kick       Hard Kick (when surrounded)
Jump Kick        up + (any) Kick
Chop             up + (any) Punch

- LONG RANGE MOVES

Flip Kick        down-forwards + Hard Kick
Flying Kick      up-forwards or up-back + (any) Kick
Flying Chop      up-forwards + (any) Punch

- DEFENSIVE MOVES

High Block       back
Crouch           down
Crouch Block     down-back
Flip             down-back or down-forwards
Recover          tap any attack button quickly
Recovery Kick    Hard Kick (from a knockdown)
Counter Throw    back + Fast Punch (when opponent goes for a throw)

- FIGHTER MODE
(activate Fighter mode when Chi metre is at 50% by pressing 2 or 5)

Ultrafast Punch  (any) Punch x multiple
Ultrafast Kick   (any) Kick x multiple
Somersault       up-back or up-forwards
Ultra Jumpkick   up + Fast Kick
Ultra Flyingkick up + Hard Kick

When in Fighter Mode, Bruce is much more likely to suffer a stun and become
vulnerable for a few seconds.  Although he gets more speed and power, it's
probably better to let your Chi build up to enter Nunchuka Mode.

- NUNCHUKA MODE
(activate Fighter mode when Chi metre is at 75% by pressing 3 or 6)

Stab Attack      Hard Kick
Swing Attack     Fast Kick
Neck Tie         forward + Fast Punch (must be a VERY close range)

When your Chi drops below 75%, you'll lose your Nunchuks.  You can gain Chi
without attacking in normal mode by quickly alternating between Hard and Fast
Punch's (mash them quickly) to keep boosting your chi back up.  Chi is gained
also when a successful attack is made, unsuccessful or blocked attacks lose you
Chi. Collecting a Yong Yang symbol in two-player VS mode also refills Chi.

===============================================================================
****************************** 3) WALKTHROUGH *********************************
===============================================================================

Before you get started you need to choose a difficulty mode.  In "Piece of
Cake" mode you can only fight as far as level 4.  In "Easy" mode you can go as
far as level 7.  From "Normal" mode onwards, you can fight all the way through
to level 10.  The only thing that really changes is the cheapness of your
opponents.  they get much better at magically "anticipating" your moves as the
difficulty gets higher.

You can also tackle Story Mode with two players, this is covered in the
"Extra's" section of this guide. You can also select the speed of play
increasing to "turbo" and "manic" for extra fast fighting action.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1: HONG KONG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: It's the Lantern Festival Dance and the American sailors are
             spoiling for a fight!
Enemies: Sailor with whip-chain
Notable Enemy Moves: Roll, Chain Choke

Some sailor boy is trying to muscle in on your action, so time to slpa him
down.  He is armed with a chain, so can hit you from a longer range than normal
hand-to-hand.   You best bet is to knock him to the ground with a Forearm Smash
combo and then Stomp on his prone body. Practise your Flip Kick on him as well,
this will place you in good stead with more difficult opponents.

To avoid his powerful uppercuts, stay at a distance and jump in with flying or
close range attacks.  You can try and throw him as well if you feel confident,
the Throw is one of the most damaging moves in the game and can finish him very
quickly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 2: GUSSIE YANG'S KITCHEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Now in San Francisco, Bruce gets a job as a chef.  But he gets in
             a fight with another chef over a girl. So its time to settle things
             out in the alleyway.
Enemies: Two Chef's with two cleavers each
Notable Enemy Moves: Spin Kick, Double Knife Edge


Well more trouble over a girl for Bruce.  His is first faced with one
cleaver-waving Chef. Flips Kicks work well and Smash attacks work well against
the Chef and after his health drops to 50% he will be joined by a friend.  It's
best to concentrate on the first one so you can defeat him quickly and not have
to cope with two attackers for long.

If the first Chef ducks an attack, he will stay crouched long enough for you to
jump over him and kick him in the back. If they attack you from either side you
can do the Split Kick to knock them both back.  Otherwise the Flip Kick is
great as it will definitely hit one or the other.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 3: SEATTLE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Now Bruce is teaching in Seattle, and is challenged by a brash
             young rival.  Time to teach him a lesson he won't forget.
Enemies: Scott
Notable Enemy Moves: Spin Kick, Shoulder Kick, Crushing Grab

This guy is much more powerful than those you have faced previously and if you
can activate Nunchuka Mode now is a good time to start experimenting with it.
Scott tends to attack in short, furious bursts then backs off, so it's also a
good fight to start perfecting when to block and counter.

Use your heavy attacks to start with, then when he gets wise to them, harass
him with short fast punches and kicks. If you can go into Nunchaka mode he is
easy to beat, but don't go into Fighter Mode, he will block everything you hit
him with and most likely stun you as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 4: OAKLAND
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: The location is the George Wu gym.  After rival marital artist
             find Bruce is teaching westerners, they send their best to fight
             him.
Enemies: Johnny Sun armed with a chain
Notable Enemy Moves: Throat Grab, Throw, Chain combo

Johnny likes to attack and doesn't hang back and block much so once again its
good to learn the timing of retaliatory attacks, especially the stronger ones.
Smash attacks work well, as does the flip and low sweeping kicks.  Always make
sure you Stomp on him when you knock him to the ground.  You may want to use
Nunchuka Mode for an easier win, but you should save your Chi for the next
battle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 5: HONG KONG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: On the set of a Golden Harvest movie, Bruce is attacked by two
             staff wielding females.
Enemies: Two female acrobats
Notable Enemy Moves: Pole vault Kick, Sweeping Attack

These two ladies can be the toughest opponents in the game. They can attack at
longer range and both like to batter you at the same time.  Keep moving rather
than staying still and blocking for too long.  If they manage to push you into
a corner you will be in trouble. Don't even bother trying to Throw them, it's
impossible. Don't get trapped between them either as they will kick you back
and forth and you'll lose lots of energy.

Your best bet is to furiously leap about doing Flip Kicks and Flying Attacks.
Like the two chefs, you'll start against one then the second will join in, so
again work on the one with the least energy. Try and risk using the Stomp when
you can, it will take of a lot of energy.  Don't go into Fighter Mode.  if you
feel confident with Nunchuka Mode it can also wear them down very quickly, but
your lack of moves in that mode allows them to predict you very quickly and you
may find it all getting blocked.

Basically, jump around a lot, mix up hard low close attacks with Flip Kicks,
Stomps and Flying Attacks and avoid being trapped.  These are the trickiest
opponents so at least when you beat them it's all up from here!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 6: BRUCE'S KWOON
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Back in the US at Bruce's martial arts school, old rival Scott
             is back for another lesson in defeat.
Enemies: Scott
Notable Enemy Moves: Spin Kick, Shoulder Kick, Crushing Grab

Scott is back and apart from a little more strength, he is the same as before.
Learn to counter after his attack bursts and Nunchuka's will finish him very
quickly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 7: LONG BEACH STADIUM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Confident in his superior style Bruce claims he can beat any
             opponent in a minute. So Johnny Sun returns for a rematch.
Enemies: Johnny Sun
Notable Enemy Moves: Throat Grab, Throw

This level has a timer on it.  You have to beat Johnny Sun in sixty seconds or
less. Nunchuka Mode makes this very easy if you can do it, you can beat him in
around 20 seconds! Otherwise use Smash attacks, Stomps and Throws to deplete
his energy in the fastest possible time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 8: THAILAND
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Bruce is shooting his first film as the star (The Big Boss), and
             Johnny Sun's brother Luke is out for revenge!
Enemies: Luke Sun
Notable Enemy Moves: Foot Sweep, Flying Kick

This fellow looks intimidating, but is actually pretty easy to beat.  More or
less any tactics will work, combo Smash attacks and Flips for a fast depletion
of energy.  Once his health is at 50% he will run off screen and you must
follow him.  You will have Ice Blocks slid at you, so jump over it with a
flying kick.  Keep doing this until you reach Luke and you should be able to
finish him off easily.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 9: HONG KONG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Now on the set of his biggest movie, Enter The Dragon, Bruce
            fights the Claw Man in an epic showdown.
Enemies: The Claw Man
Notable Enemy Moves: Smoke blow, Claw combo

Bruce Lee takes on his most famous screen opponent.  The Claw Man is mostly a
close range attacker.  He will blow smoke at Bruce which will damage him at a
distance and then slash him up close with his claws.  So when you see him take
a breath ready to blow smoke, jump over it and do a flying attack to the head.
if this works and grounds him, quickly Stomp on him.  As he will keep trying to
hit you with the smoke, take advantage of the pause before he does it to keep
jumping and attacking.

Use this fight to build your Chi metre up to maximum if possible, at least as
much as needed to enter Nunchuka Mode.  You MUST be able to do that for the
final battle which follows this one. You must also be able to carry off the
neck-tie move or you can't win.  So practice here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 10: THE GRAVEYARD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description: Sadly Bruce is dead.  His last battle is against the Phantom
             who has haunted his thoughts all his life.
Enemies: The Phantom, armed with Kwondon (sword)
Notable Enemy Moves: Sword slash combos

The phantom himself isn't to tricky, but you can only finish him off with one
specific move, which of course is a real bitch to pull off.  Basically enter
nunchuka mode and wait for him to strike you with his sword, as he starts to
slash, either jump over his head and strike him from behind with your Nunchuka,
or hop backwards just out of range then attack as he does his recovery from the
miss. Try not to get trapped in the corner as you move backwards.

Once he is totally out of energy the only move that will kill him is the
Neck-Tie.  Perform it by practically walking into the Phantom then pressing
forward + Fast Punch.  If you pull it off, you'll flip the Phantom over and
choke him.  So sit back and enjoy another crappy ending sequence.

===============================================================================
******************************* 4) EXTRAS *************************************
===============================================================================

There are a few extra bits and bobs on top of the story mode.  For your
pleasure here is your guide to them.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWO PLAYER MODES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- TWO PLAYER STORY MODE

You and a pal fight together against the CPU opponents.  if one of you loses
all their life mirrors, they will be transported into a nightmare where they
must fight the Phantom. Don't fight him, just avoid him until he stabs his
Kwondon into the ground, he'll disappear and you'll get all your life mirrors
back.  You can do this until level 10, where only one of you can fight the
Phantom in the final showdown.

- ONE/TWO PLAYER BATTLE MODE

Your basic Vs Mode. Unfortunately the only choosable character is Bruce lee,
gah! Pick a stage to fight on a set handicaps on the Battle Mode screen.
During the fight, Yin Yang symbols will appear, jump up and grab them to refill
energy and Chi.

- TWO PLAYER VS. CPU BATTLE

In this mode there will be three Bruces; you, your friend and a CPU controlled
Bruce.  Last one standing wins the battle.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BONUS LEVEL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is one Bonus Level, which allows you to build you Chi up after the second
level. You attack Pete the Dummy by hitting the pads and avoiding the sticks.
The more you hit the pads the faster the sticks will spin, but the faster they
spin, the more Chi you will get when you make successful hits.  You can only
access this level in Normal/Mantis Mode.
